First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

    #State: Output State: `t` is an empty list, `ans` is the maximum count of consecutive 1s found in the binary representation of the elements in `a` for each bit position from 29 to 0, `n` is a value between 1 and 100000, `x` is an integer between 0 and 2^30 - 1, `a` is the return value of `func_1()`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over bit positions from 29 to 0. For each bit position, it checks the bit values of `x` and the elements in `a`. If both bits are 0, it skips. If the bit in `x` is 0 and the corresponding bit in `a`'s sum is odd, it returns `ans`. If the bit in `x` is 0 and the corresponding bit in `a`'s sum is even, it performs some operations on `a` and updates `t`. If the bit in `x` is 1 and the corresponding bit in `a`'s sum is odd, it skips. If the bit in `x` is 1 and the corresponding bit in `a`'s sum is even, it calculates the maximum count of consecutive 1s found in the binary representation of the elements in `a` for that bit position and updates `ans`. If the bit in `x` is 1 and the corresponding bit in `a`'s sum is 0, it breaks the loop. After the loop, `t` remains empty, `ans` contains the maximum count of consecutive 1s, and other variables retain their original values.
    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns the maximum value between ans (which is the maximum count of consecutive 1s found in the binary representation of the elements in a for each bit position from 29 to 0) and the length of the list a.
