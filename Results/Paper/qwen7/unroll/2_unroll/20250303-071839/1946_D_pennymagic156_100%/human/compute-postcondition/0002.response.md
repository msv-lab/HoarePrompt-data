Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `n` is a value between 1 and 100000, `x` is an integer between 0 and 2^30 - 1, `a` is the return value of `func_1()`**.

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables, `t` and `ans`. `t` is set to an empty list (`[]`), and `ans` is set to `-1`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
