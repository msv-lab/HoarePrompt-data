Output State: **`n` is a value between 1 and 100000, `x` is an integer between 0 and 2^30 - 1, `a` is the return value of `func_1()`**.

The code `a = func_1()` assigns the return value of the function `func_1()` to the variable `a`. Since the exact behavior of `func_1()` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `a`. However, we know that `a` will hold whatever value `func_1()` returns. The initial states of `n` and `x` remain unchanged.
