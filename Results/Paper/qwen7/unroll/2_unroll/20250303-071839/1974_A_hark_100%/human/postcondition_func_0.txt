The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it calculates a value based on the given conditions: if both \(x\) and \(y\) are positive, it computes the sum of two ceiling values; if only \(y\) is positive, it computes the ceiling of \(y/2\); if only \(x\) is positive, it computes the ceiling of \(x/15\); and if both \(x\) and \(y\) are non-positive, it returns 0. The function outputs a list of these calculated values, one for each test case.
