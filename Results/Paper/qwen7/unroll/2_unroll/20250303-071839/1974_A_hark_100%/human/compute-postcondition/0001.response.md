State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an input integer, `k` must be between 0 and ap-1 inclusive**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `k` is initialized to 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
2. The loop condition `k < ap` must hold true for the loop to continue executing.
3. Therefore, `k` must start from 0 and can go up to `ap-1` (inclusive) for the loop to execute fully.
4. The initial value of `ap` does not directly affect the loop's execution; it determines the upper limit of `k`.
5. The variable `t` is not involved in the loop condition and its current value does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `ap` (to ensure the loop can execute) and `k` (which must start from 0 and can go up to `ap-1`).
