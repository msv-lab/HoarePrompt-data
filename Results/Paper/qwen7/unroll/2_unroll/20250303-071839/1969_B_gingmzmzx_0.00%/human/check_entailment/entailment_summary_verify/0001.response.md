### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. A substring can be cyclically shifted, and the cost of a shift is the length of the substring.

2. **Review of the Provided Code**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It converts the input string into a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeroes in the string.
   - It initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the count of 1s encountered so far.
   - It iterates through the string and calculates the answer based on certain conditions.
   - However, the logic in the code does not correctly simulate the process of cyclic shifts to sort the string.

3. **Analysis of the Logic**:
   - The variable `ans` is incremented based on whether a zero has been encountered after a one (`if c == 0 and cnt[1] > 0`) or based on the difference between the number of zeroes and ones seen so far (`else: ans += zeroes - cnt[0]`).
   - This logic does not correctly simulate the minimum cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum cost to sort the string. This involves identifying the longest prefix that is already sorted and calculating the cost to move the remaining unsorted part to the beginning.
   - The correct approach would involve finding the first occurrence of '1' and the last occurrence of '0', and then calculating the cost of moving the unsorted part to the beginning.

5. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function summary states that the function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. It calculates and prints a value `ans` based on the counts of 0s and 1s in the binary string `s`.
   - The summary mentions that if `t` is within the range 1 to 10^4, it performs the calculation; otherwise, it does not process the test case. The final output consists of `t` lines, each containing the calculated value `ans` for the respective test case.
   - However, the function summary does not mention how the value `ans` is calculated, which is crucial for understanding the correctness of the function.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem. The logic used in the code does not correctly simulate the minimum cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string. The function summary does not provide enough information to validate the correctness of the implementation.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly solve the problem, and the function summary does not provide sufficient details to validate the correctness of the implementation.

### Final Evaluation:
