State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `n` which is used as the range parameter for the `range(n)` function.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) because `range(n)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `n-1`.
3. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop condition and its value does not affect whether the loop will execute or not.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `n` is greater than 0.

Hence, the state should be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 0 while keeping the value of `t` as given.
