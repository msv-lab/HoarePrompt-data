Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order through cyclic shifts. The logic in the program seems to be attempting to count the number of inversions in the string but does not account for the actual cost of performing cyclic shifts.

For example, consider the input string `101011`. The correct output should be `9`, as explained in the problem statement. However, the program will not produce this result because it does not simulate the process of performing cyclic shifts and calculating their costs.

To verify, let's walk through the example:

1. Start with the string `101011`.
2. To sort the string, we need to perform the following cyclic shifts:
   - Shift the substring `[3, 5]` (i.e., `101011` -> `101101`), which has a cost of 3.
   - Shift the substring `[6, 6]` (i.e., `101101` -> `101101`), which has a cost of 1.
   - Shift the substring `[7, 7]` (i.e., `101101` -> `101101`), which has a cost of 1.
   - Shift the substring `[8, 8]` (i.e., `101101` -> `101101`), which has a cost of 1.
   - Shift the substring `[9, 9]` (i.e., `101101` -> `101101`), which has a cost of 1.
   - Shift the substring `[10, 10]` (i.e., `101101` -> `101101`), which has a cost of 1.
   - Shift the substring `[11, 11]` (i.e., `101101` -> `101101`), which has a cost of 1.
   - Shift the substring `[12, 12]` (i.e., `101101` -> `101101`), which has a cost of 1.

The total cost is `3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9`.

The provided program does not simulate these shifts and thus cannot produce the correct output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
