Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are strings of equal length consisting of digits from 1 to 9.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `f` is 1, `x` is a string of digits, `y` is a string of digits, `a` is a list of characters from `x` sorted in non-decreasing order compared to the corresponding characters in `b`, `b` is a list of characters from `y`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop compares each character in list `a` with the corresponding character in list `b`. If the character in `a` is less than the character in `b`, it swaps them and sets `f` to 1. If the character in `a` is greater than the character in `b`, it sets `f` to 1. If `f` is 1 at the end of the loop, it means there was at least one swap, indicating that the lists `a` and `b` were not already in the desired order. The lists `a` and `b` will be sorted in such a way that for every pair of elements, the element from `a` is not greater than the corresponding element from `b`.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: `f` is 0, `x` is a string of digits, `y` is a string of digits, `a` is a list of characters from `x` sorted in non-decreasing order compared to the corresponding characters in `b`, `b` is a list of characters from `y`, and the loop prints each character in list `a` on a new line.
    print()
    #This is printed: a newline
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: The output state will be the contents of list `b`, printed on separate lines in the order they appear in `b`.
    print()
    #This is printed: nothing
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two strings of equal length consisting of digits from 1 to 9 as input, converts them into lists of characters, and sorts the first list (`a`) in non-decreasing order compared to the corresponding characters in the second list (`b`). If any swaps occur during the sorting process, it indicates that the original lists were not in the desired order. The function then prints the sorted list `a` followed by the original list `b` character by character. The function does not return any value.
