Output State: **`idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5 and `k` is an integer where 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` and `k` is even; the values of `n` and `k` are set by the input.split(' ') method; `permutation` is a list of length `n` containing only zeros.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value 1 to `idx_v`. The initial value of `idx` remains unchanged at 0. The values of `n` and `k` are still within their specified ranges and are set by the `input.split(' ')` method. The list `permutation` remains a list of length `n` containing only zeros.
