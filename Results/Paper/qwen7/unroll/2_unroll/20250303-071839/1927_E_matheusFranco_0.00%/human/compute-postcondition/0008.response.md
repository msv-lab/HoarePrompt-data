Output State: **`idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5 and `k` is an integer where 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` and `k` is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at positions 0, `k`, `2k`, ..., `k*(k-1)` are filled with values from 1 to `k`, and `curr_v` is `k+1`; `result` is a string containing space-separated values from the `permutation` list converted to strings.**

Explanation: The code `result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])` creates a string `result` by joining the string representations of each element in the `permutation` list with a space. The values of `idx`, `idx_v`, `n`, `k`, `permutation`, and `curr_v` remain unchanged.
