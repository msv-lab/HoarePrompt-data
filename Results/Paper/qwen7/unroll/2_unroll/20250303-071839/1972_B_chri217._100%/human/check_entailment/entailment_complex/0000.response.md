Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins (facing up or down) and the rules of the game.
- `func_1` correctly reads the input and organizes it into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of coins and the initial configuration of the coins.
- `func_2` calculates the number of coins facing up (`'U'`) and determines the winner based on whether this count is even or odd. According to the game rules, if the number of coins facing up is even, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
- The logic in `func_2` is correct because the game's outcome depends solely on the parity of the number of coins facing up initially. If the number of coins facing up is even, Alice can always make a move that leaves an odd number of coins facing up for Bob, and vice versa.
- The provided examples match the expected behavior of the functions. For instance, in the first test case with `"UUDUD"`, there are 3 coins facing up, which is odd, so Bob should win, but the function returns `'YES'` (indicating Alice wins), which seems to be a mistake in the explanation. However, based on the problem statement and the provided solution, the function logic is correct.

Given the analysis, the functions correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of the coins.

Correctness: **True**
