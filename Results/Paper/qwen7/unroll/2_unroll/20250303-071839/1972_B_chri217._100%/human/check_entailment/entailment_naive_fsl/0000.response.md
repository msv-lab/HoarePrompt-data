Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are only two coins left and one of them is facing up. According to the problem description, if there are only two coins left and one is facing up, the player should remove the facing-up coin and not flip the adjacent coin. However, the current implementation does not account for this specific scenario. This leads to incorrect results for certain inputs.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
UU
```

The correct output should be "YES" because Alice can remove one of the facing-up coins and leave the other coin, which will result in Bob losing. However, the current program will incorrectly output "NO" because it does not handle the case where there are only two coins left and one is facing up.
