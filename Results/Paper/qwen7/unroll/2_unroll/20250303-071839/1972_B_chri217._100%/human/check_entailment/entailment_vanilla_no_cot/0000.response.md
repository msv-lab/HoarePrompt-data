Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: 
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates over each test case, reading the number of coins (`n`) and the state of the coins (`s`). This function correctly gathers all necessary data for processing.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - `func_2` takes a single test case as input and counts the number of coins that are facing up (`ups`).
   - If the number of facing-up coins (`ups`) is even, Alice wins ("YES"). Otherwise, Bob wins ("NO").

3. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The game's outcome depends on whether the initial number of facing-up coins is even or odd.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Alice can always force the game into a state where the number of facing-up coins remains even after her turn, ensuring she can always make a move until the game ends with an even number of coins, leading to her winning.
   - Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Bob can mirror Alice's moves to ensure the number of facing-up coins remains odd after his turn, eventually forcing Alice to lose when no more moves are possible.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "YES" or "NO" for each test case based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins, which aligns with the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program accurately determines the winner based on the optimal strategy for both players, making the correctness of the program **True**.
