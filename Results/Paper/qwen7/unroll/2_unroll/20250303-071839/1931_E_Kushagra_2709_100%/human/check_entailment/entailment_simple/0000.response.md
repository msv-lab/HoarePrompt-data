Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the state of the program before and after each function call.
2. The `func_1` function calculates the total length of the numbers in the list after reversing some of them and then subtracts the counts of zeros in every second number in descending order.
3. The logic in `func_1` checks if the resulting total length is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.
4. The `zerocnts` function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a number's string representation.
5. Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should correctly determine the winner based on the optimal play of both players.

Correctness: **True**
