Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `tot`:**
   - The variable `tot` is intended to represent the total number of trailing zeros across all numbers in the list. However, the current implementation sums the lengths of the string representations of the numbers, which is not relevant to the problem.
   - The function `zerocnts` calculates the number of trailing zeros in a number, but it is used incorrectly in the main function `func_1`.

2. **Sorting and Iterating Over `cntvals`:**
   - The sorting and iteration over `cntvals` are not correctly implemented to achieve the goal of determining the winner. The logic for updating `tot` by subtracting `cntvals[i]` every two iterations is flawed and does not align with the problem requirements.

3. **Winning Condition Check:**
   - The condition `if tot >= m + 1` is incorrect. The problem requires checking if the final number after all moves is at least \(10^m\). The current logic does not reflect this requirement.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to focus on the following:

- Count the number of trailing zeros in each number.
- Use these counts to determine the optimal moves for both players.
- Determine the winner based on the parity of the count of trailing zeros and the value of \(m\).

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(n, m, nums):
    # Count the number of trailing zeros in each number
    trailing_zeros = [str(num).rstrip('0')[-1::-1].count('0') for num in nums]
    
    # Sum the trailing zeros
    total_trailing_zeros = sum(trailing_zeros)
    
    # Determine the winner based on the parity of the total trailing zeros
    if total_trailing_zeros % 2 == 0:
        return 'Anna'
    else:
        return 'Sasha'

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, nums))
```

This solution correctly counts the trailing zeros in each number and determines the winner based on the parity of the total count of trailing zeros.
