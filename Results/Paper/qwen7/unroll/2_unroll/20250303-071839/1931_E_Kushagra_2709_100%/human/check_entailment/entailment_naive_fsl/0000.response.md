Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `zerocnts` do not accurately simulate the game rules.

1. **Game Logic Misunderstanding**: The functions do not simulate the actual game process where Anna reverses the digits of an element and Sasha concatenates two elements. Instead, they seem to be calculating something related to the number of trailing zeros in the numbers, which is not aligned with the problem description.

2. **Incorrect Functionality**: The `func_1` function calculates the total length of the numbers after reversing and then checks against `m + 1`. However, this does not reflect the actual game logic where Sasha and Anna take turns modifying the list until only one number remains.

3. **Missing Game Simulation**: There is no code that simulates the turns of Anna and Sasha, nor does it handle the conditions under which Sasha wins or Anna wins based on the remaining number.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the described game logic and thus is incorrect.
