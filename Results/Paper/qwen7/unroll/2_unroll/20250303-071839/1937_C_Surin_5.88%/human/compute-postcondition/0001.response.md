Output State: **A lambda function `R` is defined to take an integer input, and the existence of the secret permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) is maintained.**

The lambda function `R` is defined to read an integer input from the user, but no input has been provided yet, so the value of `R()` is undefined until an input is given. The secret permutation remains unchanged.
