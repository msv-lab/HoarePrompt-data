Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, where \(p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}\) is a permutation of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\). The function achieves this by making up to \(3n\) queries to compare bitwise OR results.**
