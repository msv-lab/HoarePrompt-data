Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, the value of `t` remains within this range after executing the code. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet provided.
