Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, the function returns a result based on the string `s`, which represents the initial state of the coins.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing specific parameters `t`, `n`, and `s`, and returns a result for each case based on the string `s`.
