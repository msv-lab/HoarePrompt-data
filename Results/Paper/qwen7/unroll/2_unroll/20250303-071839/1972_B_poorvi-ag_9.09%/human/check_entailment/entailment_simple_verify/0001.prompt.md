You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins.

    #State: Output State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `results` is a list containing 'no' or 'yes' based on the conditions specified in the loop for each iteration of `i` from `range(t)`. For each iteration, if `n` (an integer input) is even, 'no' is appended to `results`. If `n` is odd and the count of 'U' in the string `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', 'yes' is appended to `results`; otherwise, 'no' is appended.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing either 'no' or 'yes' based on the conditions specified in the loop for each iteration of `i` from `range(t)`. For each iteration, if `n` (an integer input) is even, 'no' is appended to `results`. If `n` is odd and the count of 'U' in the string `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', 'yes' is appended to `results`; otherwise, 'no' is appended. The loop prints each element in `results` on a new line.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `arr` representing the initial state of the coins.

2. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The program checks if `n` is even. If `n` is even, it immediately appends 'no' to the results list, assuming Alice cannot win.
   - If `n` is odd, it compares the count of 'U' (up) and 'D' (down) coins.
     - If the count of 'U' is greater than the count of 'D', it appends 'yes' to the results list, assuming Alice can force a win.
     - Otherwise, it appends 'no' to the results list.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints each result from the results list.

### Reasoning:

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `n` is even, the program correctly assumes that Alice cannot win because she will always face an even number of coins, which means Bob can always mirror her moves and ensure he wins.
   - When `n` is odd, the program incorrectly assumes that Alice can win just by having more 'U' coins. However, this does not necessarily guarantee a win because the optimal strategy involves more complex interactions between the coins and the players' choices.

2. **Complexity and Strategy:**
   - The problem requires a deeper understanding of the game dynamics and optimal strategies. Simply counting the number of 'U' and 'D' coins is insufficient to determine the winner.
   - The given solution does not account for the actual game rules and optimal moves. For instance, if there are three coins in a row "UUU", Alice can remove the middle coin and flip the remaining two, leaving Bob with no valid move.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the optimal strategy. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
