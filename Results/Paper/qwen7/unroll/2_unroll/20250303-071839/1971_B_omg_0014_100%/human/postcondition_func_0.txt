The function processes `n` test cases, where `n` is read from input. For each test case, it reads a string `s` and checks if all characters in `s` are unique. If they are, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by either the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s` or its reverse, whichever comes first when sorted normally. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.
