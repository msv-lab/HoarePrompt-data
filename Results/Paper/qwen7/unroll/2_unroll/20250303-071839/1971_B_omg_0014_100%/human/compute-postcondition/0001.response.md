State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in Loop Head**: The loop head contains three variables: `i`, `n`, and the range function which implicitly uses `n`.
2. **Determine Initial Values**: 
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer because the `range(n)` function requires `n` to be non-negative.
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
3. **Adjust States**:
   - Since `t` is not directly involved in the loop's execution condition, it remains as given.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - `i` must be 0 at the start of the loop.

Thus, the state to be adjusted is that `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0.
