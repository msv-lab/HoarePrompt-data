Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the original `password` string sorted in ascending order; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the original `password` string, now sorted in ascending order; `sortedPassword` is a string that is the concatenation of the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists. Both `digits` and `letters` lists satisfy the conditions that no two consecutive elements in `digits` are out of order and the last element in `digits` is not greater than any element in `letters`.**

Explanation: The code `sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)` concatenates the `digits` and `letters` lists into a single string and assigns it to `sortedPassword`. Since `digits` contains only digits sorted in ascending order and `letters` contains only lowercase Latin letters sorted in ascending order, the resulting `sortedPassword` will be a string that starts with all the digits in ascending order followed by all the letters in ascending order. The conditions that no two consecutive elements in `digits` are out of order and the last element in `digits` is not greater than any element in `letters` are preserved in the new `sortedPassword`.
