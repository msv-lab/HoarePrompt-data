Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `char`, which is used to iterate over each character in the string `password`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `char`**: For the loop to start executing, `char` must be assigned the value of the first character in the string `password`. Since `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, the loop will execute at least once.

3. **State Adjustments**: We need to ensure that the initial state of `char` is set to the first character of `password`. Additionally, since the loop modifies `digits` and `letters`, we should keep their current states as they are because they are not part of the loop head.

4. **Final State**: After the first iteration, `char` will hold the first character of `password`, and the rest of the string will be processed in subsequent iterations.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `char` to be the first character of `password`.

**State:**
**`char` is the first character of the string `password`, `digits` is an empty list, `letters` is an empty list**
