Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the iterable `digits`.

2. **Determine the Range of the Loop**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(digits)`. This means the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `digits` list.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `password`: A string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
   - `digits`: A list containing all the digit characters from the original `password` string, sorted in ascending order.
   - `letters`: A list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the original `password` string, sorted in ascending order.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The variable `i` starts at 0 and will increment with each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the `digits` list. Therefore, `digits` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the `digits` list is non-empty for the loop to execute. The initial state of `i` is irrelevant since it starts at 0 and will be incremented within the loop.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`digits` must have at least 1 element**
