Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly separates the digits and letters from the input password.
2. It then sorts these lists separately.
3. The function checks if the last digit is not greater than any of the letters.
4. Finally, it constructs a new password by concatenating the sorted digits and letters and compares it with the original password.
5. The logic for checking the order of digits and letters is correct.
6. The overall structure of the function ensures that the conditions specified in the problem statement are met.

Given the above points, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required logic to verify if a password meets the criteria defined in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
