Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as specified in the problem description. It separates the characters into digits and letters, sorts them individually, and then checks if the original password matches the sorted version of its digits followed by its letters. The function `func_1` performs these checks accurately, and the main loop processes each test case appropriately.
