Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for q in range(t):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `q` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - Before the loop starts, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - Other variables remain unchanged.

3. **Adjust the States for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to \(t-1\). Since `t` is a positive integer, it will always be greater than or equal to 1.
   - The variable `q` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `t` must be a positive integer (since it is given that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\)).
- `q` must be 0.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:
**`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), `q` is 0**.
