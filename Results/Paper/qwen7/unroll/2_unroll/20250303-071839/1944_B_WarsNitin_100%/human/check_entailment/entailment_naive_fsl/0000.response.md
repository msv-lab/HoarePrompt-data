Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement to ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in array `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in array `r`. Specifically, the program does not guarantee that the selected elements from the two halves of the input array will result in the same XOR value for both arrays.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
4 2
5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2
```

The program's output for this input is:

```
5 1 3 3
6 4 2 4
```

However, the XOR of the elements in `l` (5 ^ 1 ^ 3 ^ 3) is 2, while the XOR of the elements in `r` (6 ^ 4 ^ 2 ^ 4) is 6. This violates the requirement that the XOR values of `l` and `r` must be equal.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the selected elements from both halves of the array result in the same XOR value. One approach could involve maintaining a running XOR for both halves and adjusting the selections accordingly to balance the XOR values.
