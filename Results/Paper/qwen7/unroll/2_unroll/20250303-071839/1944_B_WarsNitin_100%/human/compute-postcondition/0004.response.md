Functionality: **The function processes a list 'a' of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, along with two integers 'n' and 'k'. It sorts the first n elements and the remaining elements separately. Based on the value of k, it constructs two lists, ans1 and ans2, by selecting elements from the sorted segments, ensuring no element is repeated more than twice unless it is the last or second last element in the sorted segments. Finally, it prints t pairs of lists, each containing ans1 and ans2, for t test cases.**
