Output State: **`T` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.** 

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the same condition applies to `T` after the code is executed. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
