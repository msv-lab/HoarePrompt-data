Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic for counting the number of triangular pieces of cake is flawed. The program attempts to count the number of gaps between the chosen vertices, assuming that each gap can form a triangle with the next vertex. However, this approach does not account for the fact that the vertices are part of a polygon, and the number of triangles that can be formed is actually related to the number of vertices rather than just the gaps between them.

For example, consider the test case provided:

```
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```

The program outputs `2`, but the correct answer should be `3`. Here's a correct construction:

- Choose vertices 1, 2, and 6 to form a triangle.
- Choose vertices 2, 5, and 6 to form another triangle.
- The remaining vertices (3, 4, and 7, 8) cannot form additional triangles without intersecting existing ones.

The program fails to account for this and similar scenarios, making it incorrect.
