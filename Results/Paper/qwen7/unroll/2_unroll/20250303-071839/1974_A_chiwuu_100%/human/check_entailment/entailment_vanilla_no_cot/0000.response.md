Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Calculation of Space Needed for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates `t` as the number of 2x2 icons divided by 2, rounding up if necessary. This part is correct.

2. **Space Calculation for Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - The calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is incorrect. It seems to be an attempt to calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons, but it doesn't account for the actual capacity of the grid correctly.
   - Each 5x3 grid has 15 cells. After placing `t` 2x2 icons, the remaining space should be calculated correctly, but the formula used here is flawed.

3. **Final Calculation of Screens:**
   - The final calculation to determine the number of additional screens needed is also incorrect. It assumes that every 15 cells can fit 15 1x1 icons, which is not always true due to the placement constraints.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
- Calculate the space taken by 2x2 icons.
- Calculate the remaining space in terms of 1x1 cells.
- Determine how many additional screens are needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate space taken by 2x2 icons
        t = (b + 1) // 2  # Number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        # Calculate remaining space for 1x1 icons
        remaining_space = 5 * 3 * t - b * 4
        # Calculate additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        additional_screens = (a + remaining_space - 1) // remaining_space
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = t + additional_screens
        print(total_screens)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the space calculations and the final screen count are accurate.
