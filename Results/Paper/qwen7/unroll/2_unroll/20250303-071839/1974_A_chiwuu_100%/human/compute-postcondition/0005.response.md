Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\), and a positive integer \(t\) (where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)). For each test case, it calculates a final value of \(t\) based on specific operations involving \(x\) and \(y\). The function updates \(t\) according to predefined rules and prints the final value of \(t\) for each test case. The overall effect is to transform the initial value of \(t\) into a new value based on the given inputs and conditions.**
