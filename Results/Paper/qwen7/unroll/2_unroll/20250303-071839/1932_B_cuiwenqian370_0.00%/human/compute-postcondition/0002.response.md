Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `n` is an integer representing the number of signs for each test case.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(data[0])` to the variable `t`. The variable `data` remains unchanged, and `n` is still an integer representing the number of signs for each test case, which hasn't been modified yet.
