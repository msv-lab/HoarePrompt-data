Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `n` is an integer representing the number of signs for each test case, `index` is 1.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `index`. The initial values of `data`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions along with the updated value of `index`.
