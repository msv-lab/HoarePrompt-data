Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the year in which all \( n \) signs will occur sequentially, given their periodicities.
- The provided code consists of two functions:
  1. `func_1`: This function is designed to process a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, but the problem description does not mention any such strings or characters. Therefore, this function seems unrelated to the problem at hand.
  2. `func_2`: This function reads input for multiple test cases, extracts the number of signs and their periodicities, and calls `func_1` with these periodicities. However, since `func_1` is not relevant to the problem, `func_2` will also be irrelevant.

Given that the problem description and the provided functions do not align, the functions provided cannot solve the given problem correctly. The problem requires finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities to determine when all signs will occur sequentially, but neither function addresses this requirement.

Correctness: **False**
