Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure he has at least one problem of each required difficulty level for `m` rounds. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, and then reads a string `s` representing the difficulties of the existing problems.
3. It initializes a counter for the required difficulties ('A' to 'F') and uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty in the string `s`.
4. It calculates the number of additional problems needed for each required difficulty:
   - If a difficulty is missing (`i not in hmp`), it needs `m` additional problems.
   - If a difficulty is present but insufficient (`hmp[i] < m`), it needs `m - hmp[i]` additional problems.
5. It sums up these values to get the total number of additional problems needed for the current test case.
6. It prints the result for each test case.

Given the execution summary and the provided example, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
