Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` is an integer input from the user.
   - The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than 0.

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
