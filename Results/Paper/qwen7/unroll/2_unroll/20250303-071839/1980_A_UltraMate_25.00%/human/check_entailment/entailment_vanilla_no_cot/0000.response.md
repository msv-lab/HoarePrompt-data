Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way it counts the required problems to meet the difficulty requirements for `m` rounds.

1. **Initial Calculation**: 
   - The program calculates the missing problems needed for all difficulties ('A' to 'G') separately and adds them to `ans`. This approach is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that some difficulties might be over-provided, and we only need to ensure each difficulty meets the requirement for `m` rounds.

2. **Second Calculation**:
   - The second loop checks if any difficulty is insufficient and adds the difference to `ans`. However, this still doesn't correctly handle the scenario where multiple difficulties are needed but some are already over-provided.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to count how many times each difficulty appears in the input string.
   - For each difficulty required (`A` to `G`), check if the count in the input string is less than `m`.
   - If it is, calculate the shortfall and add it to the answer.
   - Since the problem guarantees that the input will always have at least one of each difficulty, we can simplify the logic.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        hmp = Counter(s)
        ans = 0
        for i in 'ABCDEFG':
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that we only count the shortfall for each required difficulty and sum them up to get the minimum number of additional problems needed.
