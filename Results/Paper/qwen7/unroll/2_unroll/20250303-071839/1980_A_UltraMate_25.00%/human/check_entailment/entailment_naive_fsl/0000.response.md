Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that each round requires exactly one problem of each difficulty level, and it incorrectly increments the count for each missing difficulty level without considering the overlap between rounds.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
7 2
ABCDEFABC
4 2
ABCDABCD
5 1
ABCDEABCDE
```

- For the first test case (`7 2`), the input string `ABCDEFABC` already contains all necessary difficulties for 2 rounds. However, the program incorrectly calculates that Vlad needs to create 2 problems (one 'G' and one 'A'), which is not the case since the string already contains all required difficulties.
- For the second test case (`4 2`), the input string `ABCDABCD` also already contains all necessary difficulties for 2 rounds. The program incorrectly calculates that Vlad needs to create 4 problems (one for each missing difficulty), which is not the case.
- For the third test case (`5 1`), the input string `ABCDEABCDE` already contains all necessary difficulties for 1 round. The program incorrectly calculates that Vlad needs to create 1 problem (one 'F'), which is not the case.

The program fails to correctly handle the requirement that each round must have one problem of each difficulty level, and it does not properly account for the overlap between rounds. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
