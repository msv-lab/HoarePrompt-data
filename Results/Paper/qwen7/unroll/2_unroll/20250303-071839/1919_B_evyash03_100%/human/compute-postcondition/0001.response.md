Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `char` which is used to iterate over each character in the string `expression`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `char`**: Since the loop iterates over each character in `expression`, the initial value of `char` should be the first character of `expression`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `expression`**: The loop will execute as long as there are characters left in `expression`. Therefore, `expression` must be a non-empty string.

4. **Consider the Length Constraint**: The problem states that `length` (the length of `expression`) is an integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000. This constraint is already satisfied by the fact that `expression` is a non-empty string.

5. **Initial State of `count`**: The variable `count` is not directly involved in the loop head, so its initial state (`count` is 0) does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `expression` must be a non-empty string.
- `char` must be the first character of `expression`.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**State: `count` is 0, `expression` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character of `expression`**
