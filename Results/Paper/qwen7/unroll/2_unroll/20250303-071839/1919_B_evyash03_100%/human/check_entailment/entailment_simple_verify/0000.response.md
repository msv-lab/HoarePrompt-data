### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Statement Analysis:
- The goal is to split the array \(a\) into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
- The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
- The optimal solution requires considering all possible ways to split the array and choosing the one with the minimum total penalty.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program simply counts the number of '+' characters in the string and calculates the difference between the total length and the count of '+' characters.
- It then returns the absolute value of this difference.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
length = 6
expression = "--++--"
```
- The program counts 2 '+' characters, so `count = 2`.
- The number of '-' characters is `length - count = 6 - 2 = 4`.
- The program returns `abs(2 - 4) = 2`.

However, the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is `([--++], [--])`, which results in a penalty of:
- Penalty of `[--++]`: \( |(-1 - 1 + 1 + 1)| \times 4 = 0 \times 4 = 0 \)
- Penalty of `[--]`: \( |(-1 - 1)| \times 2 = 2 \times 2 = 4 \)

Total penalty: \(0 + 4 = 4\).

The program's output of 2 is incorrect because it does not account for the optimal splitting strategy.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program before and after the function call. However, the logic within the function is flawed as it does not implement the required optimal splitting strategy.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The provided solution only considers a simple difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters without considering the optimal splitting strategy.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
