### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
- Each excursion involves choosing a pair of children randomly and independently.
- If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
- The friendship value of a pair who are not friends remains 0 and does not change.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   ```python
   def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
       result = 0
       for i in range(m):
           (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
           result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
       return result % MOD
   ```
   - This function iterates over all \( m \) pairs of friends.
   - For each pair, it adds the friendship value \( f \) multiplied by the sum of the first \( k \) natural numbers, which is \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \).
   - This multiplication assumes that each pair will be chosen exactly \( k \) times, which is incorrect because the pairs are chosen randomly and independently.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   ```python
   def func_2():
       t = int(input())
       for _ in range(t):
           (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
           friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
           result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
           print(result)
   ```
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases, the number of children, pairs of friends, and the number of excursions.
   - It then calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The original assessment states that the program does not correctly calculate the expected value because it does not account for the probability of choosing each pair.
- However, the problem statement specifies that the pairs are chosen randomly and independently. The key insight here is that the expected value of the sum of friendship values can be calculated by considering the probability of each pair being chosen in each excursion.

Given that the problem involves random selection and independence, the expected value for each pair can be calculated as follows:
- The probability of choosing any specific pair in one excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
- Since the pairs are chosen independently, the expected value for each pair being chosen at least once in \( k \) excursions is \( k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

The function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the expected value by assuming each pair is chosen \( k \) times, which is not the correct approach. Instead, it should calculate the expected value based on the probability of each pair being chosen.

However, the provided solution in `func_1` does not correctly implement the probability-based expected value calculation. The original assessment is accurate in pointing out the flaw in the current implementation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the expected value due to the incorrect assumption about the number of times each pair is chosen. The original assessment is accurate.
