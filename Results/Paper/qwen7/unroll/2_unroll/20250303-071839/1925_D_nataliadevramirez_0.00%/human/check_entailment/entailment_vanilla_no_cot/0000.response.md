To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions. The key points are:
1. Each excursion chooses a pair of children randomly.
2. If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
3. We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of these friendship values for \( k \) excursions.

### Given Code Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
```python
def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
        result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
    return result % MOD
```

- **Logic**: 
  - For each friendship, the function calculates the contribution to the expected value.
  - The term \( k \times (k + 1) // 2 \) represents the sum of the first \( k \) natural numbers, which is the expected number of times a specific friendship will be chosen.
  - This sum is then multiplied by the friendship value \( f \).
  - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Function `func_2`
```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)
```

- **Logic**:
  - Reads the number of test cases \( t \).
  - For each test case, reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
  - Reads the list of friendships.
  - Calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result.

### Correctness Check

1. **Sum of First \( k \) Natural Numbers**:
   - The formula \( k \times (k + 1) // 2 \) correctly calculates the sum of the first \( k \) natural numbers.
   
2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), which is necessary to handle large numbers.

3. **Friendship Value Contribution**:
   - The function correctly multiplies the friendship value \( f \) by the expected number of times the pair will be chosen, which is \( k \times (k + 1) // 2 \).

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution.

### Conclusion

The given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
