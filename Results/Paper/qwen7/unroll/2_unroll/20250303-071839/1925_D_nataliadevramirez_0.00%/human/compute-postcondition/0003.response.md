Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: t (an integer representing the number of test cases), n (an integer representing the number of children), m (an integer representing the number of pairs of friends), and k (an integer representing the number of excursions). Additionally, it accepts a list named friendships, where each inner list contains three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively. Depending on the input, the function may return different outputs for each test case, but no specific return type or value is mentioned in the given information.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each involving a certain number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions. It also takes into account the friendship values between pairs of children. However, without more specific details on the expected output for each test case, the exact nature of the return value cannot be precisely defined.
