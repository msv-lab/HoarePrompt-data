Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function iterates over each friendship and calculates the contribution of each friendship's value to the expected sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.
   - The formula used is \( f \times \left(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\right) \mod \text{MOD} \), which correctly accounts for the expected increase in friendship value due to the random selection of each friendship pair in each excursion.
   - The function then returns the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function handles the input for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`.
   - It then reads the details of each friendship and passes these details along with `n`, `m`, and `k` to `func_1`.
   - Finally, it prints the result returned by `func_1`.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly processes each test case by reading the necessary inputs and calling `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
   - The logic for calculating the expected sum of friendship values is sound and follows the problem statement accurately.
   - The use of modulo arithmetic ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. There are no logical errors or omissions that would make the program incorrect.

Correctness: **True**
