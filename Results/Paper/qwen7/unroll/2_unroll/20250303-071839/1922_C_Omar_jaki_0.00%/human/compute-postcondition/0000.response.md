Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a lambda function that returns a map of integers from input split by spaces.**

The code defines a lambda function `r` that takes input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each string to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `m`, nor does it affect the queries. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state.
