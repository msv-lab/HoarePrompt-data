Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating a sequence \(a\) of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
   - No subsequence of \(a\) sums to \(k\).
   - For all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there is a subsequence of \(a\) that sums to \(v\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(k\).
   - The core logic involves constructing a sequence based on the binary representation of numbers and ensuring the conditions are met.
   - Specifically, the sequence construction:
     - Includes the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\).
     - Includes the next power of 2 greater than \(k\).
     - Includes all powers of 2 from 1 up to but not exceeding the largest power of 2 less than \(k\).
   - This ensures that all numbers from 1 to \(n\) (except \(k\)) can be formed as a subsequence sum, and \(k\) cannot be formed as a subsequence sum due to the inclusion of the next power of 2 greater than \(k\).

3. **Verification**:
   - The constructed sequence meets the criteria for each test case.
   - The length of the sequence is controlled within 25, which is valid.
   - The logic ensures that no subsequence sums to \(k\) while allowing all other sums from 1 to \(n\) (excluding \(k\)).

Given the analysis, the provided function correctly implements the required logic and meets the problem's constraints.

Correctness: **True**
