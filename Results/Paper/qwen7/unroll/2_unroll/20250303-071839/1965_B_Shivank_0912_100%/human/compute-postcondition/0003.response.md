Output State: t test cases are processed. For each test case, the value of `k` is decomposed into a list of powers of 2, including the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, the next power of 2 greater than `k`, and the next power of 2 after that. Additionally, all powers of 2 from 1 up to but not exceeding the largest power of 2 less than `k` are included in the list. The length of this list and the list itself are printed for each test case.
