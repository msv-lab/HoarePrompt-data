You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` as inputs and generates a list containing specific powers of 2 related to `k`. The list includes the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, the next power of 2 greater than `k`, and all powers of 2 from 1 up to but not exceeding the largest power of 2 less than `k`. It then prints the length of this list followed by the list itself for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
- We need a sequence \(a\) of at most 25 non-negative integers.
- No subsequence of \(a\) should have a sum equal to \(k\).
- For all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there should be a subsequence of \(a\) with a sum of \(v\).

### Analysis of the Given Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating the Sequence:**
   - The program calculates an integer `i` such that \(1 << (i+1) > k\). This ensures that \(1 << i < k \le 1 << (i+1)\).
   - It initializes the answer list `ans` with three values:
     - \(k - (1 << i)\)
     - \(k + 1\)
     - \(k + 1 + (1 << i)\)
   - It then appends powers of 2 (from \(1 << 0\) to \(1 << 19\)) to the list `ans`, skipping the power of 2 corresponding to `i`.

3. **Output:**
   - The length of the sequence `ans` is printed.
   - The sequence `ans` is printed.

### Verification:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to \(k\):**
   - The sequence includes \(k - (1 << i)\) and \(k + 1 + (1 << i)\), which means no combination of these values can sum to \(k\). This is because any sum involving \(k - (1 << i)\) will be less than \(k\), and any sum involving \(k + 1 + (1 << i)\) will be greater than \(k\).

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to \(n\) Except \(k\):**
   - The sequence includes \(k + 1\), which can form subsequences summing to any value from 1 to \(n\) except \(k\). By including powers of 2, the program can form any sum from 1 to \(n - 1\) using these values.

3. **Sequence Length:**
   - The sequence length is determined by the number of elements added, which is 23 (three fixed values plus 20 powers of 2). This is well within the limit of 25.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly generates a sequence that meets all the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
