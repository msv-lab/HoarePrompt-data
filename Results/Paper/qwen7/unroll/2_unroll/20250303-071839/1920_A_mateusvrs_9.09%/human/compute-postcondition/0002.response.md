Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), the loop will definitely execute if `t` is at least 1.

3. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 so that the loop can start executing. The values of `n` and `r` do not affect the loop's ability to execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being at least 1.

**State: **`t` must be at least 1**
