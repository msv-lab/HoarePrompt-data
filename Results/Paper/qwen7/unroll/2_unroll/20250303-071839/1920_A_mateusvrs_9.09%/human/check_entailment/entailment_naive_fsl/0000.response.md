Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are overlapping constraints correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for the possibility that there might be multiple constraints of type 3 (k must not be equal to some integer x) that overlap with the range defined by the constraints of type 1 and 2.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
According to the problem description, the program should calculate the number of integers k that satisfy all constraints. In this case, the constraints are:
- \( k \geq 3 \)
- \( k \leq 10 \)
- \( k \neq 1 \)
- \( k \neq 5 \)

The valid values for k are 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, which gives us 7 possible values. However, the program incorrectly calculates the result as 0 because it does not properly handle the intersection of constraints.

The program logic does not correctly compute the range and exclude the values specified by the 'not equal' constraints. This leads to an incorrect result in scenarios where there are overlapping 'not equal' constraints within the range defined by 'greater than or equal to' and 'less than or equal to' constraints.
