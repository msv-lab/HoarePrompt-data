The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer \( t \) and \( n \), along with constraints defined by integers \( a \) and \( x \). For each test case, it calculates a value based on the maximum and minimum values of \( x \) for types 1 and 2, and the count of \( x \) values in type 3 that fall within a specific range. If the maximum value of type 1 constraints is greater than or equal to the minimum value of type 2 constraints, it appends 0 to the result list. Otherwise, it calculates the difference between the minimum and maximum values of type 2 constraints, subtracts the count of overlapping \( x \) values in type 3, and appends this value to the result list. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
