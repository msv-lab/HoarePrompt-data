Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly initializes variables to store the bounds (`ax` and `bx`) and the set of excluded values (`cx`).
2. For each constraint, it updates the bounds and adds excluded values to the set.
3. After processing all constraints, it checks if the lower bound (`bx`) is less than the upper bound (`ax`). If not, it means there's no valid range for `k`, so it appends `0` to the result list.
4. If `bx` is less than `ax`, it calculates the number of valid integers between `bx` and `ax` that are not in `cx`.
5. The logic for calculating the number of valid integers is correct because it subtracts the count of excluded values within the range from the total number of integers in the range.
6. The program prints the results for each test case as required.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the annotated program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
