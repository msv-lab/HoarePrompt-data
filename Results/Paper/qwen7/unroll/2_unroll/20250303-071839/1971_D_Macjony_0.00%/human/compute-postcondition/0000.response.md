Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and it is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, after executing the code, `t` will now hold the specific integer value entered by the user, which must still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500. The precondition that `s` is a binary string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 remains unchanged and is still valid.
