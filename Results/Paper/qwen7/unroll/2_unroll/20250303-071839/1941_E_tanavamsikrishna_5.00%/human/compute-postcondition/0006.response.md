Output State: `total_costs` is a list of length `n - (k - 1)`, where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list starting from index `i` to `i + k - 1` for each iteration `i` in `range(len(costs) - (k - 1))`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` retain their original values; `rows` retains its original structure and values.
