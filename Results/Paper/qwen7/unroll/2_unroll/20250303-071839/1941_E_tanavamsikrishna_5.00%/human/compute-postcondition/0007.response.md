Based on the initial state provided:

- `total_costs` is a list of length `n - (k - 1)`, where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list starting from index `i` to `i + k - 1` for each iteration `i` in `range(len(costs) - (k - 1))`.

The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the minimum value among the elements in the `total_costs` list.

Since the exact values of `costs`, `n`, `k`, and the resulting `total_costs` list are not provided, we can only describe the value that will be printed in terms of the elements of `total_costs`.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of k consecutive elements from the costs list)**
