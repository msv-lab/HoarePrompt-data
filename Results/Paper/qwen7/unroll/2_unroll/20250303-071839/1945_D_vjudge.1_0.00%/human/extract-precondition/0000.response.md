Precondition: **numero_testes is an integer such that 1 ≤ numero_testes ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and the subsequent lines contain n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
