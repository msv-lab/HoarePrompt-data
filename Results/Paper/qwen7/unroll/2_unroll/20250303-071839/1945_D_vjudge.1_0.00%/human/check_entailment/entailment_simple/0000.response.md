### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The problem involves a queue of \( n \) people, and Kirill, who is at the end of the queue, wants to move to one of the first \( m \) positions by swapping places with people in front of him.
   - Each swap incurs costs: moving past the \( i \)-th person costs \( a_i \) coins, and for each person \( k \) between \( j \) and \( i \), it costs \( b_k \) coins.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost while ensuring Kirill ends up in one of the first \( m \) positions.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - The function reads the input values for \( n \), \( k \), \( \text{lista\_A} \), and \( \text{lista\_B} \).
     - It reverses both lists to facilitate processing from the end of the queue towards the beginning.
     - It calculates the minimum cost using a sliding window approach, where it keeps track of the cumulative cost (`soma_b`) and the prefix sum (`pref`) of the conditions where \( \text{lista\_A}[i] < \text{lista\_B}[i] \).
     - It iterates through the last \( k \) elements to find the minimum cost to reach one of the first \( m \) positions.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
     - It correctly processes each test case and prints the result.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The code handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately by iterating through the required range and updating the minimum cost.
   - The logic for calculating the minimum cost is sound and follows the problem's requirements.

4. **Output Verification**:
   - The output of the program matches the expected format and values as seen in the example provided.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and meets all the specified requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
