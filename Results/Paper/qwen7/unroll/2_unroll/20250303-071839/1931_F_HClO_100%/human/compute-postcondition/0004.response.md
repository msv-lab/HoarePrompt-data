Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving two lists of integers. It checks if the lists can be transformed into each other by inserting one specific element at certain positions. If the lists can be transformed successfully for all test cases, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function modifies the lists `l1` and `l2` based on the conditions specified in the code, and performs additional checks to ensure the transformations are valid.**
