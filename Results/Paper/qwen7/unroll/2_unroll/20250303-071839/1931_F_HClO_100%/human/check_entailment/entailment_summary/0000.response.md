Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
2. It checks if the first two lists (`l1` and `l2`) can be transformed into each other by inserting one specific element at certain positions.
3. The function correctly identifies the positions where elements need to be inserted to match the subsequent lists.
4. The function handles edge cases such as when only one screenshot is provided and when the elements to be inserted are at the end of the list.
5. The function correctly processes multiple screenshots and ensures that all transformations are valid before printing 'yes' or 'no'.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the function appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It checks the conditions and performs the necessary transformations to determine if the given orders of participants can be unified.

Correctness: **True**
