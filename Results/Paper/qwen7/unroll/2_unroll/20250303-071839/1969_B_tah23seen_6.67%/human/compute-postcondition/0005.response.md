Output State: **`s` is a list containing all characters from `sChar`, in the same order they appeared; `left` is 0; `cost` is 0**

The code initializes the variable `cost` to 0. This does not affect the values of `s` or `left`. Therefore, the list `s` remains unchanged, and the value of `left` remains 0. The only new information is that `cost` is now 0.
