Based on the initial state provided:

- `v` is equal to `n`.
- `cnt` is equal to `0`.
- `l` is equal to `n + 1` for each iteration of the outer loop.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('! -1', flush=True)
```

Here, the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'! -1'`. The values of `v`, `cnt`, and `l` do not affect this particular print statement because it is not inside any loops or conditional statements that would involve these variables.

Therefore, the output will be exactly as specified in the `print` statement.

Output: **! -1**
