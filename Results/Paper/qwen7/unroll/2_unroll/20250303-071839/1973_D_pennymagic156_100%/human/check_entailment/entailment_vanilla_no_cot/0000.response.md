To determine if the given Python program is correct, let's analyze the logic step-by-step based on the problem description.

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays where each subarray's product of its length and its maximum equals `m`.
   - We can query the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = x` for given `l` and `x`.

2. **Program Logic:**
   - The function `func_5` is supposed to implement the solution.
   - It starts by querying the maximum possible value for `f(1, r)` for decreasing values of `r` starting from `n`.
   - It then tries to split the array into `k` subarrays with the found maximum value `v`.
   - For each potential split point, it queries the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = i * v` for `i` from 1 to `k`.
   - If it finds a valid split, it prints the value `i * v` and exits.
   - If no valid split is found, it prints `-1`.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Querying Maximum Value:**
   - The loop `for i in range(n, 0, -1):` correctly queries the maximum possible value for `f(1, r)` for decreasing values of `r`.
   - However, the logic inside the loop to break when `v == n` might not be necessary. Instead, we should directly store the result of the query.

2. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n // k + 1):` attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays.
   - The inner loop `while cnt and l < n + 1:` correctly queries the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = i * v`.
   - The condition `if cnt == 0 and l == n + 1:` checks if a valid split is found.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where `k` is 1 or the array length `n` is small.
   - The program does not handle the case where no valid split is found within the allowed queries.

### Conclusion:

The program seems to follow the logic but has some issues:
- The initial query logic can be simplified.
- Edge cases are not handled properly.
- The program assumes that the maximum value `v` can be found within the constraints, which might not always be true.

Given these points, the program is not fully correct as it may fail in certain edge cases or not handle all scenarios properly.

### Final Answer:
**Correctness: False**
