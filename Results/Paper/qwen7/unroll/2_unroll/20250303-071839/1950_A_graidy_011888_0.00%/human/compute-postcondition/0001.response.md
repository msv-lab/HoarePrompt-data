State: **`i` is 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop condition is `i <= 1000`.
2. For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i <= 1000` must be true.
3. Right before the loop, `i` is 1.
4. Since `1 <= 1000` is true, no adjustment is needed for `i`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is 1**
