Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( T \).
2. For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( m \) from the input.
3. The program aims to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. However, the current implementation seems to be incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

The current implementation uses a different formula that does not correctly reflect the problem's constraints. Specifically, the line:
```python
x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
```
is not derived from the problem statement and does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

To verify correctness, we should check if the given solution matches the expected output for the provided examples. Given the complexity and the nature of the problem, the provided code does not seem to follow the correct logic.

Correctness: **False**

A correct solution would involve iterating through possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking if they satisfy the condition \( (a + b) \% (b * \gcd(a, b)) == 0 \).
