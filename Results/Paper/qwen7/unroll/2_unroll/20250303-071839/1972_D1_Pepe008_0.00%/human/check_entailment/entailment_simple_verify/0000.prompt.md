You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

        'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1

    #State: Output State: The value of `T` is reduced to 0 after all iterations of the loop have finished. For each iteration `t` from 0 to `T-1`, the loop processes the inputs `a` and `b`, calculates the sum `suma` based on these inputs, and prints `suma - 1`. The final state of `T` is 0 since it starts from 1 and is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs using a different approach that does not adhere to the problem's requirements.

For example, consider the test case \(n = 3\) and \(m = 5\):

- According to the problem description, the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), and \((1, 4)\).
- However, the program calculates the number of valid pairs using a formula that does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To verify this, let's manually check the pairs:
- For \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\), which is not a multiple.
- For \((1, 2)\): \(1 + 2 = 3\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 2\), which is not a multiple.
- For \((1, 3)\): \(1 + 3 = 4\) and \(3 \cdot \gcd(1, 3) = 3\), which is not a multiple.
- For \((1, 4)\): \(1 + 4 = 5\) and \(4 \cdot \gcd(1, 4) = 4\), which is not a multiple.
- For \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 4\), which is a multiple.
- For \((2, 4)\): \(2 + 4 = 6\) and \(4 \cdot \gcd(2, 4) = 8\), which is not a multiple.
- For \((3, 3)\): \(3 + 3 = 6\) and \(3 \cdot \gcd(3, 3) = 9\), which is not a multiple.
- For \((3, 6)\): \(3 + 6 = 9\) and \(6 \cdot \gcd(3, 6) = 18\), which is not a multiple.

The program fails to correctly identify these valid pairs, hence it is incorrect.
