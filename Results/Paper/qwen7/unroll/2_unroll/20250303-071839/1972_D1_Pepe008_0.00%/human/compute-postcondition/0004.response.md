Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6) are processed. The function returns different values based on the conditions given for n and m.**

This means the function indirectly accepts a series of test cases, each containing an integer t followed by two integers n and m. For each test case, the function evaluates n and m according to specified conditions and returns a result based on those evaluations.
