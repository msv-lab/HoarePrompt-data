Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code initializes the number of test cases `T` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It then uses a formula involving division and modulo operations to calculate `suma`, which seems to be an attempt to count valid pairs.
   - However, the formula used in the code does not correctly reflect the conditions specified in the problem statement.

3. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is not derived from the problem constraints and does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges and checking if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds true.
   - This involves computing the greatest common divisor (gcd) for each pair and checking the condition.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as per the given conditions.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
