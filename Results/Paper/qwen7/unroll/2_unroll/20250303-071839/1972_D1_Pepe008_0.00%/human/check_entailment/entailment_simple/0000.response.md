### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The code aims to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` where `1 \leq a \leq n`, `1 \leq b \leq m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)`.
   - The commented-out section suggests a brute-force approach, which is inefficient but could be used for verification.
   - The uncommented section uses a more optimized approach to calculate the number of valid pairs.

3. **Optimized Calculation**:
   - The formula used in the code is derived from the condition `a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}`.
   - The key part of the calculation is:
     ```python
     x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
     ```
     This formula seems to be an attempt to count the valid pairs efficiently. However, let's verify if this formula correctly counts the pairs.

4. **Verification**:
   - The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` should be checked against the problem constraints and the expected output.
   - The final result is printed as `suma - 1`, which suggests there might be an off-by-one error or a misunderstanding in the logic.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the formula used in the code does not seem to directly match the required conditions. Instead, a more accurate approach would involve iterating through possible values of `a` and `b` and checking the condition directly.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The formula used in the optimized section does not accurately count the valid pairs based on the given conditions.

**Correctness: **False**
