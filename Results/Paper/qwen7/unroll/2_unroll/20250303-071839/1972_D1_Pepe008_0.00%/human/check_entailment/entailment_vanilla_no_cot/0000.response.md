Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Inner Loop Range**: The inner loop `for j in range(4, b+1):` is hardcoded with a start value of 4, which is not aligned with the problem statement where `b` is the upper limit for `b`. This will lead to incorrect results for many test cases.

2. **Formula Used in the Sum Calculation**: The formula used in the sum calculation `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not correctly represent the condition that `a + b` should be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. This formula seems to be derived from a misunderstanding of the problem's constraints and conditions.

3. **Commented Out Code**: There is commented-out code that attempts to directly check the condition using nested loops. However, this approach is inefficient and not optimized for large values of `n` and `m`.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to properly implement the logic that checks the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` for all pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b)

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

func()
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the given condition using the `gcd` function from the `math` module. This approach ensures correctness but may still be slow for very large values of `n` and `m`. For optimization, more advanced number theory techniques could be applied, but the above code is a straightforward and correct implementation.
