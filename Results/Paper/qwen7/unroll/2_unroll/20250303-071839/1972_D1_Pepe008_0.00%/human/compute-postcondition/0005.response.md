Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates a sum based on these integers using a specific formula and prints the result minus one. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the counter \(T\) is reduced to zero.**
