### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the winner of the game based on the initial configuration of the coins.
   - Alice and Bob take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - Each test case consists of the number of coins `n` and a string `s` representing the initial configuration of the coins.
   - The function `func_1(s)` is supposed to determine the winner based on the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`).

3. **Function `func_1(s)` Analysis:**
   - The function counts the number of facing-up coins using `s.count('U')`.
   - If the count of facing-up coins is odd, it returns `'YES'`, indicating Alice wins.
   - If the count of facing-up coins is even, it returns `'NO'`, indicating Bob wins.

4. **Game Logic Verification:**
   - The key insight is that the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner.
   - This is because:
     - Removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins changes the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
     - If the number of facing-up coins is odd at the start, Alice can always ensure it remains odd after her turn, forcing Bob to face an even number of facing-up coins eventually.
     - Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even at the start, Bob can ensure it remains even after his turn, forcing Alice to face an odd number of facing-up coins eventually.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where there are only one or two coins left appropriately.
   - For `n = 1`, no coins are flipped.
   - For `n = 2`, one coin is removed without flipping.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The logic in `func_1(s)` correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
   - The program reads and processes multiple test cases correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the analysis above.
