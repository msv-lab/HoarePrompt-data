Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly simulate the game as described. According to the problem description, the game involves removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. However, the provided `func_1` function simply counts the number of coins facing up and determines the winner based on whether this count is odd or even. This approach does not accurately reflect the game's rules.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
5
UUDUD
```

- In the first test case, the initial string is "UUDUD".
- Alice can remove the first coin, making the string "DUD".
- Bob can then remove the second coin, making the string "DU".
- Alice can remove the remaining coin, and the game ends.

According to the problem description, Alice wins because she made the last move. However, the provided function incorrectly returns "YES" for this case because the number of facing-up coins (2) is even.

To correctly implement the game, the function needs to simulate the removal and flipping process iteratively until no more moves are possible, and then determine the winner based on whose turn it is next.
