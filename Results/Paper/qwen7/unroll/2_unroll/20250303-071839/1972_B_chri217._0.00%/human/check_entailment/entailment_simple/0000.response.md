### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into parts. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program iterates through each test case, correctly extracting the number of coins (`n`) and the state of the coins (`s`).

3. **Function Call**: The `func_1` function is called with the string `s` for each test case. The function's logic is as follows:
   - Count the number of coins facing up (`num_up`).
   - Determine the winner based on whether `num_up` is odd or even:
     - If `num_up` is odd, Alice wins.
     - If `num_up` is even, Bob wins.

4. **Game Logic**: The logic implemented in `func_1` matches the problem statement. Specifically:
   - The game ends when there are no more coins facing up.
   - The player who faces up an odd number of coins will eventually win because they can always make a move that leaves an even number of coins facing up for their opponent.

5. **Output**: The program prints "YES" or "NO" based on the result from `func_1`, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of the coins.

### Correctness:
**True**
