The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by iterating through `a` and appending elements from the start or end based on the direction specified in `s`. Then, it calculates the cumulative product of the reversed list `b` and stores these products in a list `ans`. Finally, it returns a list that is the reverse of `ans`.
