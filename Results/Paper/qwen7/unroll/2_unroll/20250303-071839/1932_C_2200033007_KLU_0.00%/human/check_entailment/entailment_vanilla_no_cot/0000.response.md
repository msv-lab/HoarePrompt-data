Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Specifically, the `func_1` function is incorrectly handling the calculation of the product of the array elements and the application of the modulo operation with `m`. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Product**: In the `func_1` function, the product `p` is being calculated using the values in `b` which are just the indices of the original array `a` without considering the actual values of `a`. This means `p` is simply accumulating the indices rather than the product of the array elements.

2. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation should be applied to the product of the current state of the array `a` before appending it to the result list `ans`. However, the current implementation does not reflect this.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in b:
        p = (p * v) % m  # Apply modulo operation here
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)
```

This corrected function ensures that the product of the current state of the array `a` is calculated correctly and the modulo operation is applied as required.
