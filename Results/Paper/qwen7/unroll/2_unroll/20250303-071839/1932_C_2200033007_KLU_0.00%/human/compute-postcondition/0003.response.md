Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is being initialized by the `range(n)` function.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop will start with `i` being 0, as `range(n)` generates values from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be 0, and `n` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5.

4. **Check Other Variables**: The other variables (`b`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `l`, `r`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their initial states do not affect whether the loop can execute. They remain unchanged or are not referenced within the loop head.

Given this analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5**
