Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the string `s` is too short to contain all possible subsequences of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not ensure that the string `s` is long enough to contain all required subsequences before attempting to construct them.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
3 3 6
abcabc
3 3 5
abcabc
3 3 4
abcabc
```

- For the first test case, the string `abcabc` is long enough to contain all possible subsequences of length 3 formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets (`aaa`, `aab`, `aac`, `aba`, `abb`, `abc`, `aca`, `acb`, `bac`, `bab`, `bba`, `bbb`, `bbc`, `cac`, `cab`, `bac`, `bcb`, `cac`, `cba`, `cbc`, `ccc`). Therefore, the output should be `YES`.

- For the second test case, the string `abcabc` is still long enough to contain all possible subsequences of length 3 formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets. Therefore, the output should be `YES`.

- For the third test case, the string `abcabc` is too short to contain all possible subsequences of length 3 formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets. The output should be `NO`, but the program incorrectly prints `YES`.

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the case where the string `s` is insufficiently long to contain all required subsequences, leading to incorrect results.
