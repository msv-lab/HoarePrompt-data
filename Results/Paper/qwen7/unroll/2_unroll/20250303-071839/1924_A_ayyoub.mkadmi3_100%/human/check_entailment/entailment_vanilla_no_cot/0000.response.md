Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the longest prefix and suffix of the string `s` that contain all the required characters. However, it does not correctly handle the logic for determining if all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s`.

2. **Main Logic Error**: The main part of the code assumes that if `func_1` returns `True`, then all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. This is incorrect because `func_1` only checks for the presence of characters, not the formation of all possible sequences.

3. **Generating Non-Subsequence String**: The logic for generating a non-subsequence string is flawed. It simply finds the first character that is not in `s1` and repeats it `n - len(s2)` times. This approach does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid sequence of length `n` that cannot be a subsequence of `s`.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
t = int(input())
OUT = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    all_subsequences = set()
    
    # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k lowercase letters
    def generate_sequences(prefix, k, n):
        if len(prefix) == n:
            all_subsequences.add(prefix)
            return
        for char in range(ord('a'), ord('a') + k):
            generate_sequences(prefix + chr(char), k, n)
    
    generate_sequences('', k, n)
    
    # Check if all generated sequences are subsequences of s
    for seq in all_subsequences:
        if not is_subsequence(seq, s):
            OUT.append('NO')
            OUT.append(seq)
            break
    else:
        OUT.append('YES')
        
def is_subsequence(sub, s):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(char in it for char in sub)

for i in OUT:
    print(i)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:

1. **Generate All Possible Sequences**: Use a recursive function to generate all possible sequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase letters.
2. **Check Subsequences**: For each generated sequence, check if it is a subsequence of `s` using the helper function `is_subsequence`.
3. **Output Result**: If any sequence is not a subsequence, output 'NO' followed by the sequence. Otherwise, output 'YES'.

This approach ensures that the solution correctly identifies whether all possible sequences of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s`.
