### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several issues with the program, particularly with the function `func_1`. Let's re-evaluate the function and the overall logic to determine if the program is correct.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Filtering:**
   - The function correctly filters `s` to keep only characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - However, the logic for checking if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences is flawed. The function does not ensure that all combinations of `n` characters from the first `k` alphabets are present in `s`.

2. **Return Values:**
   - The function returns a tuple `(bool, str, str)` where:
     - The first element indicates whether `s1` is at least `n * k` characters long.
     - The second element is a substring of `s1` starting from the position `r * k`.
     - The third element is `s2`, which contains the removed character.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic checks the result of `func_1` and constructs the output accordingly.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it constructs a string `be9i` using the first `k` alphabets that is not present in `s1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "Yes".

#### Detailed Verification:

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle edge cases like when `s` is very short or when `n` is large compared to `k`.
   - The function `func_1` should correctly identify if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`.

2. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` does not ensure that all combinations of `n` characters from the first `k` alphabets are checked. It only checks if the filtered string `s1` is at least `n * k` characters long, which is insufficient to determine if all possible strings are subsequences.

3. **Constructing the Result String:**
   - The construction of `be9i` assumes that `s1` is missing some combination, but this assumption might not hold true for all cases. The function does not guarantee that the constructed string `be9i` is a valid counterexample.

#### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identified that the program is not solving the problem as intended. The function `func_1` does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are checked, and the main logic constructs a string `be9i` without sufficient validation.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
