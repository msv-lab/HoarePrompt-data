### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` to determine its correctness based on the given problem description and the function summary.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Purpose**: The function `func_1` filters the string `s` to keep only characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. **Behavior**:
   - It initializes `s1` to store the filtered string and `s2` to store the last removed character.
   - It iterates through the string `s`, adding characters to `s1` if they are in the first `k` lowercase alphabets.
   - If there is only one unique character in the filtered string, it removes that character and stores it in `s2`.
   - It then checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k` characters long. If so, it returns `True`, a substring of `s1` starting from the position `r * k`, and the string `s2`. Otherwise, it returns `False`, the same substring, and the same `s2`.

#### Main Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The main program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It calls `func_1` to get the result and the necessary substrings.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it constructs a string `be9i` of length `n - len(s2)` using the character that was removed in `s2` and appends it to `s2`. This ensures that the constructed string does not form a valid subsequence.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints `YES`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `NO` followed by the constructed string.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Case Handling**: The function `func_1` correctly filters the string `s` and checks if it is long enough to contain all possible subsequences of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles the case where the string `s` is insufficiently long by constructing a string that cannot be a subsequence.
- **Output Validation**: The program prints `NO` followed by a string that cannot be a subsequence if the string `s` is too short.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The function `func_1` ensures that the string `s` is long enough to contain all required subsequences, and the main program correctly handles the case where the string `s` is insufficiently long.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and function summary.
