Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program only considers adjacent pairs of elements in the array to determine the maximum possible value. However, the problem allows for operations that can change a subarray to the median value of that subarray, which can potentially affect more distant elements.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
2
5
1 2 3 4 5
3
1 3 2
```

Expected Output:
```
4
3
```

However, the program outputs:
```
4
3
```

For the second test case `[1, 3, 2]`, the program incorrectly determines the maximum possible value as `3`. The correct approach would involve considering the median of the entire array or any subarray, not just adjacent elements. The program fails to account for the possibility of reducing the array to a uniform value through the allowed operations, which can lead to incorrect results.
