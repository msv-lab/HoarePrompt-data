Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and an array a consisting of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function returns information about the array a based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for t, n, and an array a. It processes these inputs and returns specific information about the array a for each test case, adhering to the constraints provided for t, n, and the elements of a.
