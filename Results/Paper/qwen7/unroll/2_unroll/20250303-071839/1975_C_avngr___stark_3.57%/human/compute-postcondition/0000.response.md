Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. All other variables remain in their initial state.**

This means that the variable `t` now holds the value entered by the user, converted to an integer, and it must be within the range of 1 to 500. The other variables (`n` and the array `a`) are not yet defined and remain in their initial state as per the precondition.
