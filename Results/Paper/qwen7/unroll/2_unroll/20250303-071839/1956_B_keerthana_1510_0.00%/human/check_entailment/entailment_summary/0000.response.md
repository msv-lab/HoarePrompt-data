Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the maximum number of points you can get by optimally selecting cards in a game against Nene, who also plays optimally.
2. **Given Program Analysis**: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:
   - The program reads lines of input and processes only every second line starting from the third line.
   - It calculates the sum of counts of each unique element in those lines, divided by 3.
   - This approach does not account for the strategic nature of the game, where Nene always tries to maximize her score while minimizing yours.

3. **Expected Logic**:
   - For each test case, you need to simulate the game to determine the optimal strategy.
   - Given your hand of cards, you should consider how Nene will respond to your moves to maximize your score.
   - Nene's strategy involves placing cards on the table to maximize her score and minimize yours, which means you need to anticipate her actions.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - You would need to simulate the game for each test case, considering the cards in your hand and Nene's optimal responses.
   - Maintain a count of cards on the table and simulate each turn to determine the best move for you.

Given the provided program does not follow the correct logic for the problem, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**
