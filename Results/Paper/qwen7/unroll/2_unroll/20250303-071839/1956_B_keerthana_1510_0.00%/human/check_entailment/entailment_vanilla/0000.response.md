### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a card game where you and Nene play alternately.
   - Each player initially has \( n \) cards.
   - The goal is to maximize your score by selecting cards such that you earn points when placing a card with the same value as an already placed card on the table.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads input from standard input (stdin) and processes it.
   - The code iterates over every other line starting from the third line (skipping the first two lines).
   - For each line, it splits the line into elements and counts the occurrences of each unique element.
   - It then calculates the sum of the integer division of the count of each unique element by 3 and prints the result.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in the provided code does not align with the game rules.
   - Specifically, the code does not simulate the game process where each player takes turns optimally.
   - The division by 3 and counting occurrences do not reflect the scoring mechanism or the optimal strategy for either player.

4. **Expected Behavior:**
   - To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game and consider the optimal moves for both players.
   - You should keep track of the cards on the table and the cards in your hand.
   - Based on the current state, you should decide which card to play to maximize your score while considering Nene's optimal response.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
