Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5), and an array a of n integers (each a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function returns information based on the values of n, k, and the array a.**

This means the function takes in a set of test cases, each containing a value of t, n, k, and an array a, and processes these according to the specified constraints, then returns relevant information derived from these inputs.
