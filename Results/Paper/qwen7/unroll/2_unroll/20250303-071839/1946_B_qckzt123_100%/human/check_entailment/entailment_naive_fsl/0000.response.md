Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array after performing the specified operations. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `T`, and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`. It also reads the array `a`.

2. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the initial sum `s` of the array `a`.

3. **Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation**: It computes the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm (stored in `t`). This step ensures that any negative contributions to the sum are minimized.

4. **Sum Maximization Through Operations**: For each operation, the program doubles the current maximum subarray sum (`t`) and adds it to the result (`ans`). This effectively maximizes the sum by leveraging the power of doubling.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large sums.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program handles all potential cases correctly. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail based on the provided examples and the nature of the operations. Therefore, the program is correct.
