Output State: **The output state will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to the output of one iteration of the loop. For each line, the value printed will be the result of the calculation based on the given inputs n, k, and array a, modulo 1000000007. The specific values depend on the input provided through standard input during each iteration of the loop.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the output will be a series of results, each representing the computed `ans` value for each set of inputs `(n, k, a)` processed by the loop.
