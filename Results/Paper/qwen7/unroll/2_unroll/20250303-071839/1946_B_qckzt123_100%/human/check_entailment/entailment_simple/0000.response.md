Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations. Each operation allows selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting the sum of that subarray into the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The sum of the array can be increased by repeatedly adding the sum of the entire array or a significant portion of it.
   - The key insight is to use the prefix sums to find the maximum subarray sum (`t`), which helps in determining how much we can add to the array without making negative contributions.
   - After the initial sum calculation, the code doubles the maximum subarray sum (`t`) for each operation, effectively maximizing the sum.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`T`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`), the number of operations (`k`), and the array elements (`a`).
   - It calculates the initial sum of the array (`s`).
   - It computes the maximum subarray sum (`t`) using Kadane's algorithm (or similar logic).
   - It then iteratively doubles `t` for each operation, ensuring the result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to avoid overflow.
   - Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles negative numbers and zero correctly by resetting the temporary sum (`tmp`) to zero when it becomes negative.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result stays within bounds.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution correctly implements the logic to maximize the array sum after `k` operations.
   - The code is efficient and handles the constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
