Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. The array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**

The code only defines a constant `MOD` with the value `1000000007`. It does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or the array `a`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions provided.
