Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array using these operations.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The initial sum of the array (`s`) is crucial.
   - The maximum subarray sum (`t`) is also important, especially when `k > 1`.
   - Each operation effectively doubles the maximum subarray sum (`t`), and this doubling is applied `k-1` times.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The algorithm first calculates the initial sum of the array (`s`).
   - It then finds the maximum subarray sum (`t`) using Kadane's algorithm (or a similar approach).
   - The result is computed as `(s + t) % MOD`, and this result is doubled `k-1` times, with each doubling being taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.

4. **Edge Cases and Correctness**:
   - The program handles negative sums correctly by resetting `tmp` to 0 when it becomes negative.
   - The use of modulo arithmetic ensures that the result stays within the required bounds.
   - The logic for doubling `t` and adding it to the result is sound and correctly implemented.

5. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - The annotated program correctly implements the solution for all provided test cases, including edge cases like empty subarrays and large negative sums.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
