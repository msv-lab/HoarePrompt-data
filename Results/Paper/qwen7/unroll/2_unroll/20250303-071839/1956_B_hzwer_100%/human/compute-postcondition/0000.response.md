Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` represents the integers on the cards in your hand, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice. The function `input = sys.stdin.readline` is assigned to input.**

This line of code simply reassigns the built-in function `input` to `sys.stdin.readline`. It does not change the values of any variables or the conditions specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that the input function is now `sys.stdin.readline`.
