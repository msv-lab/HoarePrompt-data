Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against Nene, who also plays optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours.
2. The provided code reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and calculates the maximum points you can get based on the distribution of cards in your hand.
3. The logic in the code is as follows:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the value of `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.
   - Create a count array `cnt` to store the frequency of each integer from 1 to `n`.
   - Populate the count array `cnt` with the frequencies of the integers in `a`.
   - Calculate the maximum points you can get by summing up `max(0, x - 1)` for each element `x` in `cnt`. This is because for each integer `x` that appears more than once, you can get a point for each additional occurrence beyond the first one.
4. The code correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum points you can get, considering Nene's optimal strategy.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the code correctly computes the maximum points you can get by playing optimally.

Correctness: **True**
