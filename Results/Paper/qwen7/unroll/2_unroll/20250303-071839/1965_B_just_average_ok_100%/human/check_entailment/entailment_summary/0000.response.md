Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze whether it meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

1. **No Subsequence Summing to \( k \)**:
   - The program constructs a list `nums` that includes \( k - \text{nums}[i] \), which ensures that no subsequence sums to \( k \). This is because including \( k - \text{nums}[i] \) means that any subsequence containing \( \text{nums}[i] \) will have a sum that includes \( k \).

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to \( n \) Except \( k \)**:
   - The list `nums` also includes powers of 2, which allows for the generation of various sums through different combinations of these elements.
   - By appending \( k + 1 \) and \( k + \text{nums}[i] + 1 \), the program ensures that all values from 1 to \( n \) except \( k \) can be formed as subsequences.

3. **List Size Constraint**:
   - The program constructs the list `nums` using only 21 elements (powers of 2 up to \( 2^{20} \)), and then appends a few more elements. Since \( 2^{20} = 1048576 \), which is much larger than the maximum value of \( n \) (which is \( 10^6 \)), the list `nums` will always have a size of at most 25 elements.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program correctly outputs the length of the list followed by the list itself, which matches the required format.

Given the above points, the program appears to meet all the requirements specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
