Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each t, two positive integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ n). The function returns different outputs based on the conditions provided for n and k within each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing values for t, n, and k. For each set of n and k, the function evaluates specific conditions and returns appropriate results without needing t as a direct parameter within the function definition.
