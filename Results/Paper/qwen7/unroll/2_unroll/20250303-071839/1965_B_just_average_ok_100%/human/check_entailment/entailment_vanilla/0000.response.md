Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating the Sequence:**
   - The program generates a list `nums` using a list comprehension `[1 << i for i in range(21)]`. This creates a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
   - It iterates through this list to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
   - If such a power of 2 is found, it breaks the loop.
   - It appends `k - nums[idx]` to `nums`, where `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 less than `k`.
   - It also appends `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`.
   - Finally, it removes `1 << idx` from `nums`.

3. **Output:**
   - The length of `nums` is printed, which is the size of the sequence.
   - The elements of `nums` are printed.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.

2. **Generating the Sequence:**
   - The use of powers of 2 ensures that the sequence can represent sums of different values.
   - The logic for appending `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` ensures that certain sums are missing while others are present.
   - Removing `1 << idx` ensures that the sum `k` is not achievable.

3. **Ensuring Constraints:**
   - The sequence generated has at most 25 elements, as required.
   - The sequence includes all sums from 1 to `n` except `k`.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the example provided in the problem statement:

- For `n = 2` and `k = 2`:
  - The sequence generated is `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6]`.
  - No subsequence sums to 2.
  - All other sums from 1 to 2 are possible.

- For `n = 6` and `k = 1`:
  - The sequence generated is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
  - No subsequence sums to 1.
  - All other sums from 1 to 6 are possible.

- For `n = 8` and `k = 8`:
  - The sequence generated is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]`.
  - No subsequence sums to 8.
  - All other sums from 1 to 8 are possible.

- For `n = 9` and `k = 3`:
  - The sequence generated is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10]`.
  - No subsequence sums to 3.
  - All other sums from 1 to 9 are possible.

- For `n = 10` and `k = 7`:
  - The sequence generated is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11]`.
  - No subsequence sums to 7.
  - All other sums from 1 to 10 are possible.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence that meets the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
