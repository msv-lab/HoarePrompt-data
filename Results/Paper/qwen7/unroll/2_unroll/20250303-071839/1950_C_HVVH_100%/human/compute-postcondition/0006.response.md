Functionality: **The function processes a series of times provided as input, converting them to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. It prints each converted time and updates the AM/PM indicator accordingly. After processing all inputs, it outputs the final AM/PM indicator but leaves the original integer `t` unchanged.**
