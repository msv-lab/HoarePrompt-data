Reasoning:
- The function correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
- For each test case, the function splits the input string `s` into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
- The function checks if `h` is 0, 12, or greater than 12 to determine the correct AM/PM indicator.
- If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
- If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
- If `h` is between 1 and 11, it sets `day` to 'AM' and changes `day` to 'PM' if `h` is 12.
- The function prints the formatted time followed by the correct AM/PM indicator for each test case.
- The function correctly processes all test cases and outputs the results in the required format.

Correctness: **True**
