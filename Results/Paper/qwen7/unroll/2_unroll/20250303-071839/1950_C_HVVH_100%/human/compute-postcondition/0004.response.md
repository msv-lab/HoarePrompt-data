Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the last time conversion in the loop, `n` is the number of times the loop has executed. After executing all the iterations of the loop, `t` remains unchanged, `day` will be 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the last time conversion performed in the loop, and `n` is equal to the number of times the loop has run.
