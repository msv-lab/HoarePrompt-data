### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the example provided.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The goal is to find the minimum cost to purchase exactly \( k \) tickets over \( n \) days, where the price per ticket on day \( i \) is \( a_i \).
- A person can purchase no more than \( m \) tickets per day.
- Purchasing \( x \) tickets on day \( i \) increases the price per ticket for all subsequent days by \( x \).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        t = 0
        s = 0
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            c += s * (l[i] + t)
            t += s
            k -= s
        print(int(c))
```

#### Key Issues Identified:
1. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list of ticket prices, which is unnecessary and incorrect. The problem requires us to process the days in order, not sorted.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates the cost as if the prices do not change after each purchase, which violates the problem constraints. It should update the prices dynamically based on the number of tickets purchased on each day.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Consider the example provided:
- \( n = 4 \), \( m = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)
- \( a = [1, 3, 8, 4] \)

The optimal strategy should be:
1. Buy 2 tickets on the first day with a total cost of \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \). Prices for the next days become \( [3, 8, 4] \).
2. Buy 1 ticket on the second day with a cost of \( 1 \times 3 = 3 \).

Total cost: \( 2 + 3 = 5 \).

However, the provided program calculates:
- Buy 2 tickets on the first day with a total cost of \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \). Prices for the next days become \( [3, 8, 4] \).
- Buy 2 tickets on the second day with a total cost of \( 2 \times (3 + 2) = 10 \).

Total cost: \( 2 + 10 = 12 \).

This shows that the program does not correctly update the ticket prices after each purchase, leading to an incorrect result.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It fails to update the ticket prices dynamically based on the number of tickets purchased on each day. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
