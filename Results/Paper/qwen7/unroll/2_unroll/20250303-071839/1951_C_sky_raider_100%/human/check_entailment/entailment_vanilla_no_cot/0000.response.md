To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints.

Let's break down the program and compare it with the problem statement:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the list of ticket prices `a`.

2. **Sorting the Prices**: The program sorts the list of ticket prices `l`. This step is unnecessary because the algorithm should work regardless of the order of prices. Sorting can introduce an extra O(n log n) complexity which is not necessary.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - It initializes `t` (total tickets purchased so far), `s` (tickets to be purchased in the current iteration), and `c` (total cost).
   - For each day, it calculates the minimum between `m` and the remaining `k` tickets to be purchased (`s = min(m, k)`).
   - It adds the cost of purchasing `s` tickets at the current price plus any accumulated increase (`t`), and updates `t` and `k`.
   - Finally, it prints the total cost `c`.

4. **Accumulated Increase**: The logic for accumulating the increase in ticket prices due to previous purchases is correctly implemented. Each time `x` tickets are purchased on day `i`, the price increases by `x` for all subsequent days.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly calculates the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets while respecting the constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**True**
