Reasoning:
1. The provided code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `a`.
3. It sorts the list of ticket prices `a` to ensure that cheaper tickets are bought first, which is a reasonable strategy to minimize the total cost.
4. The algorithm iterates through the sorted list of ticket prices, buying up to `m` tickets each day, and updating the total cost `c` and the cumulative impact `t` on subsequent days' prices.
5. The logic for updating `s`, `c`, and `t` appears to be correct according to the problem statement.
6. The final output for each test case is the total cost `c`, which is printed correctly.

Given the above points, the provided code seems to implement the required logic accurately and efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
