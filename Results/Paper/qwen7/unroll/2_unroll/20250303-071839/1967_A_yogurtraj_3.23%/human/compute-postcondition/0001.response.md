Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, after the loop executes all iterations, r is an integer representing the final value of the variable r, n is an integer representing the number of cards initially, k is an integer representing the remaining operations, a is a sorted list of n integers representing the number of cards of each type, rem is an integer representing the remainder operations, and y is an integer representing the count of additional operations. The output is calculated based on the final value of r, n, rem, and y.
