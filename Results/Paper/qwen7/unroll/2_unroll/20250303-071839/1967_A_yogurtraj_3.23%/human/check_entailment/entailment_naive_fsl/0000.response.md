Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program attempts to find a way to maximize the score by adjusting the counts of the cards through buying additional cards, but it does not properly handle the requirement to form contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

The program logic seems to be attempting to balance the counts of cards to ensure that no type of card is missing more than once in any block of `n` cards. However, it does not ensure that after buying the cards, the resulting arrangement will indeed form the required contiguous subarrays.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 4
  6 1 8
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  22
  ```

- Actual Output (using the provided program):
  ```
  11
  ```

The program fails to correctly calculate the maximum score. In this case, the optimal solution would involve buying 2 cards of type 1 and 2 cards of type 2, resulting in a configuration like `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8]`. This configuration allows for 22 subarrays of length 3 that are permutations of `[1, 2, 3]`.

Since the program does not correctly handle this and other similar cases, it is deemed incorrect.
