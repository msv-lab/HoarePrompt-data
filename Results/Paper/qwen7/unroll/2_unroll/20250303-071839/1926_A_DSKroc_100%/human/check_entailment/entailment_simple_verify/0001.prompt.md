You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is a string of length 5 consisting of the letters 'A' and 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each string `s` provided according to the value of `t`, the output is either 'A' or 'B' based on whether the count of 'A's is greater than the count of 'B's in the string `s`. If the count of 'A's is greater, 'A' is printed; otherwise, 'B' is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Counting**: For each test case, the program initializes counters `ac` and `bc` to count occurrences of 'A' and 'B', respectively. It then iterates through each character in the string, incrementing the appropriate counter based on the character.
3. **Comparison and Output**: After counting the occurrences, the program compares `ac` and `bc`. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'.
4. **Edge Cases**: Since the problem specifies that the strings are of length 5 and consist only of 'A' and 'B', the logic should handle all possible combinations correctly. The program does not need to account for ties since the problem guarantees that there will be a clear winner (either 'A' or 'B' will appear more frequently).
5. **Validation**: Given the constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 32 and each string is of length 5), the program should run efficiently and produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and handles all specified conditions.

### Correctness:
**True**
