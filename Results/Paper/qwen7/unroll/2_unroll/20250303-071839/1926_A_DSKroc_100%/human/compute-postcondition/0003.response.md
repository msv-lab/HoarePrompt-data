Output State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each string `s` provided according to the value of `t`, the output is either 'A' or 'B' based on whether the count of 'A's is greater than the count of 'B's in the string `s`. If the count of 'A's is greater, 'A' is printed; otherwise, 'B' is printed.
