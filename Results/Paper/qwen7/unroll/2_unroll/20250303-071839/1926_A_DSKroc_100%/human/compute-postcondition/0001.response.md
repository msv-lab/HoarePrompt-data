State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 32, q is 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `q` starts at 0, as specified by the `range(t)` function.
- The condition for the loop to execute is that `t` must be a positive integer (since `range(t)` will run from 0 to `t-1`). Given that `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 32, we need to ensure that `t` falls within this range.
- Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `t` must be an integer between 1 and 32, and `q` starts at 0.
