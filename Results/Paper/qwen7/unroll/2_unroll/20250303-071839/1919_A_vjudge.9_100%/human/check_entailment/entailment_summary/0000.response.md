Reasoning:
The provided program logic is based on the condition that if the absolute difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. However, let's analyze the game rules more closely:

1. Each player can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet.
2. The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
3. Both players play optimally.

Given these rules, let's consider the optimal strategy:
- If a player has more coins than the opponent, they can always swap wallets and then remove a coin, ensuring they always have at least one coin.
- If a player has fewer coins, they can also swap wallets to equalize the number of coins or ensure they can always make a move.

From the game theory perspective, if \(a\) and \(b\) are equal, the player whose turn it is will lose because they cannot make a valid move without losing. If \(a\) and \(b\) are not equal, the player with more coins can always force a win by swapping and removing coins until the opponent is left with no valid moves.

However, the provided program incorrectly determines the winner based solely on the parity of the difference between \(a\) and \(b\), which does not align with the optimal strategy derived from the game rules.

To correctly implement the solution, we should check if \(a\) and \(b\) are equal. If they are, the current player (determined by the turn) will lose. Otherwise, the player with more coins will win.

Since the provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
