Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the values of `a` and `b`.
2. **Logic Implementation**: For each test case, the program calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. Based on whether this difference is even or odd, it prints "Bob" or "Alice" respectively.
3. **Output**: The output matches the expected behavior described in the problem statement. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, Bob wins; if it is odd, Alice wins.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function is correct. The program accurately determines the winner based on the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
