Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.read`**.

Explanation: The line `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`, but it does change what the `input` function refers to. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.
