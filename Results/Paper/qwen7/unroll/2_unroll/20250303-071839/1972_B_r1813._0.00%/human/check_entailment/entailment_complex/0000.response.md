Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins (facing up or down).
2. The provided solution reads input and processes each test case individually.
3. For each test case, it counts the number of coins facing up ('U') in the given string `s`.
4. If the count of 'U' is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results list, indicating Alice wins; otherwise, it appends 'NO', indicating Bob wins.
5. The logic in the provided code correctly determines the winner based on the parity (odd or even) of the number of coins facing up.
6. The code correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results for each case.

Given the above analysis, the provided code accurately implements the required logic and produces the correct output based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
