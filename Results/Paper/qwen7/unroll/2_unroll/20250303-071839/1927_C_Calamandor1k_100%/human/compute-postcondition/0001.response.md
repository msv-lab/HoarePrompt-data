Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:`.
   - The variables in the loop head are `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `cases`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The variable `results` is given as an empty list before the loop starts. This does not affect the loop's execution directly.
   - The variable `cases` is the iterable over which the loop will iterate. For the loop to execute, `cases` must contain at least one tuple of the form `(n, m, k, a, b)`.

3. **Formulate the State:**
   - We need to ensure that `cases` contains at least one tuple of the form `(n, m, k, a, b)` for the loop to execute.
   - The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` within each tuple are not specified, so we do not need to adjust these specific values.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`cases` must contain at least one tuple of the form (n, m, k, a, b)**.
