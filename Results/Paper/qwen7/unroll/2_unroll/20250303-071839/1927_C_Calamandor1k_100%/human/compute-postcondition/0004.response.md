Output State: **`results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions met during each iteration of the loop. For each tuple (n, m, k, a, b) in `cases`, if the conditions regarding the sets `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` are satisfied, 'YES' is appended to `results`; otherwise, 'NO' is appended.**

This means that the program returns a list named `results`. Each element in this list is either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether the specified conditions were met for each tuple in `cases`. The conditions involve sets `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`, but without the actual values of these sets and `cases`, we cannot determine the exact contents of `results`.
