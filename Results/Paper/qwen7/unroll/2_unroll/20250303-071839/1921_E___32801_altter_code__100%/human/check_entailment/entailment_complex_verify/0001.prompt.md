You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d2faa6ca73d70e765c2cc6ef0834e24c2e4a5528.png)
Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads six integers from the standard input, representing the dimensions of a grid and two coordinates. It then determines which player, Alice or Bob, wins based on the relative positions of the coordinates and prints the result. If the initial conditions do not lead to a clear winner, it prints 'draw'. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tt` and iterates through each test case. This part is correct.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to process each test case. This is a good approach to modularize the code.

3. **Initial Checks**: 
   - The program checks if `x2 <= x1`. If true, it prints 'draw'. This is correct because if Bob's chip is in a lower or equal row than Alice's, Bob cannot win since Alice always moves down and Bob always moves up.
   - The program then checks if `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`. This is important because it determines the parity of the difference in rows between Alice and Bob's chips. This is crucial for determining the winner.

4. **Odd Parity Case**:
   - If the difference in rows is odd, the program checks if `y1 == y2`. If true, Alice can always win by moving diagonally to capture Bob's chip.
   - If `y1 != y2`, the program attempts to move Alice's chip closer to Bob's chip. However, there are several issues:
     - The logic for moving Alice's chip is flawed. For example, the lines `y1 += 1; x1 += 1` and `y1 -= 1; x1 += 1` do not necessarily bring Alice closer to Bob's chip in all scenarios.
     - The subsequent checks for `y1 == y2` and the logic for adjusting `a`, `b`, and `t` are also problematic. The conditions and calculations do not accurately reflect the game rules.
     - The final check for `b // 2 > a` and the condition `abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c` are overly complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly.

5. **Even Parity Case**:
   - The even parity case is similar to the odd parity case but with some different conditions. The same issues apply here as well.

Given the complexity and the flaws in the logic, especially in handling the movements and conditions, the program does not correctly implement the game rules.
