Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r` increased by `a`, `y1` is the fourth element of `r`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`**.

In this output state, the value of `x1` has been updated by adding `a` to its original value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, including `t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `b`, and the condition that `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
