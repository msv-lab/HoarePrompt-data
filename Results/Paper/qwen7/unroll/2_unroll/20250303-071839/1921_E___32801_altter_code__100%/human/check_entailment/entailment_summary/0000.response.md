Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**: The function `func_1` correctly reads six integers from the input, representing the dimensions of the grid and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Initial Conditions Check**: 
   - The program checks if Bob's chip (`x2`) is initially at or below Alice's chip (`x1`). If so, it immediately prints 'Draw' because Bob cannot move above Alice's chip, and Alice cannot move below Bob's chip. This condition is correctly implemented.

3. **Odd Difference Check**:
   - If the difference between Bob's and Alice's row positions is odd, the program checks if Alice can force a win by moving diagonally. This logic is partially correct but overly complex and may not cover all edge cases.

4. **Even Difference Check**:
   - If the difference between Bob's and Alice's row positions is even, the program similarly checks if Bob can force a win. Again, this logic is overly complex and may not cover all edge cases.

5. **Edge Cases and Simplification**:
   - The program attempts to handle various edge cases but the logic is convoluted and may not be fully correct. Specifically, the logic for determining whether Alice or Bob can force a win is overly complicated and may not handle all scenarios correctly.

6. **General Logic**:
   - The overall logic for determining the winner is flawed. The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. The conditions for determining the winner are not correctly formulated, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal strategy for both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
