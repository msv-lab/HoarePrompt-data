Output State: **`t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is incremented by `a`, `y1` is adjusted based on the relationship with `y2`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` reduced by `a`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, `x1` is less than or equal to `x2`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `a` is `y2 - 1` since `y1` â‰¥ `y2`, `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, `y2` is 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `y2` to 1. This affects the value of `y2` directly, making it equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
