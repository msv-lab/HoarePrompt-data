Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is incremented by 1, `y1` is adjusted based on the relationship with `y2` (if `y2` > `y1`, `y1` becomes one more than the original value; otherwise, `y1` becomes one less than the original value), `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, and `a` is either `y2 - 1` if `y1` ≥ `y2` or `m - y2` if `y1` < `y2`.
