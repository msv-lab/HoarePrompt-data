Reasoning: 
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to check if the given list of numbers can form a progressive square based on the given \(n\), \(c\), and \(d\).

1. The function `func_1` starts by finding the minimum value in the list `l` and stores it in `a`. This value `a` corresponds to the top-left corner of the progressive square.
2. It then generates the expected values for a progressive square using the formula \(a + k \cdot c + h \cdot d\) for \(k\) and \(h\) ranging from 0 to \(n-1\).
3. These generated values are stored in the list `li`.
4. Both `l` and `li` are sorted to ensure they are in the correct order.
5. If the sorted lists `l` and `li` match, it means the original list `l` can indeed form a progressive square with the given \(n\), \(c\), and \(d\), and the function returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

Given this analysis, the program correctly checks whether the given list of numbers can form a progressive square based on the provided rules. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
