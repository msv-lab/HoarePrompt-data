You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`.
   - It then reads a list of `n^2` integers into the list `l`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes `n`, `c`, `d`, and the list `l` as arguments.
   - It calculates the minimum value in `l` and stores it in `a`.
   - It then constructs a list `li` where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for all possible pairs `(k, h)` within the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - The list `li` is sorted.
   - The original list `l` is also sorted.
   - If the sorted lists `li` and `l` are equal, the function returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly generates the progressive square based on the given formula `a + k * c + d * h`.
   - It then checks if the generated sequence matches the sorted input list `l`.
   - The sorting step ensures that the order of elements is considered, which is necessary since the problem specifies that the elements must match exactly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a loop.
   - The constraints are respected (e.g., `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `2 <= n <= 500`, etc.).

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to check if the given list of integers can form a progressive square based on the specified rules. There are no logical errors or omissions that would cause the program to fail under the given constraints.
