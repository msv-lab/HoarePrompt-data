You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for constructing a progressive square. Specifically, the program generates a sequence `li` based on the formula `a + k * c + d * h`, but this does not guarantee that the sequence will match the input array `l` for all possible values of `a`, `c`, and `d`.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  3
  3 2 3
  3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

However, the program incorrectly outputs `YES` because it does not account for the fact that the minimum value in the input array `l` might not be the starting value `a_{1,1}`. The program assumes that the minimum value in `l` is `a`, but this is not necessarily true for all progressive squares.

For example, in the given test case, the input array `l` is `[3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 1, 10, 4, 8]`. The minimum value is `1`, but the progressive square construction should start from the correct initial value `a_{1,1}`, which is not necessarily the minimum value in the array.

A correct approach would involve finding the correct starting value `a` such that the generated sequence matches the sorted input array `l`. The current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
