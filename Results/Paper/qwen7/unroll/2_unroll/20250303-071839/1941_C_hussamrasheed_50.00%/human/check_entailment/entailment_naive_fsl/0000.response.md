Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the removal of the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. Specifically, the program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and prints their sum, which is not the correct approach. For example, consider the input "mmapnapie":

- The program would count 2 occurrences of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie", resulting in a deletion count of 3.
- However, the correct solution is to remove the 4th and 9th characters, resulting in a deletion count of 2.

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly implement the requirement to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.
