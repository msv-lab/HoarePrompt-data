Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Counting Substrings:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of the substring "map" in the string `s` using `m = s.count('map')`.
   - It then removes all occurrences of "map" from the string `s` using `s = s.replace('map', '')`.
   - After removing "map", it counts the occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string `s` using `p = s.count('pie')`.

3. **Calculating Result:**
   - The program prints the sum of `m` and `p`, which represents the total number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Handling of "pie":**
   - The program only counts the occurrences of "pie" after removing all "map" substrings. However, this approach does not guarantee that the remaining string is free of "pie". For example, consider the string "piepie". After removing "map", the string remains "piepie", and the program would count two "pie" substrings but should actually require no removals since "pie" is not present.

2. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The logic of counting "pie" after removing "map" is flawed because it does not account for the possibility that "pie" might still exist in the string even after removing "map".

3. **Example Test Case:**
   - Consider the string "piepie". The program would output 2, but no characters need to be removed since "pie" is not present after removing "map".

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that both "pie" and "map" are checked simultaneously without modifying the string in between. We can use regular expressions to find and remove the shortest possible substrings ("map" or "pie") iteratively until neither is found.

### Corrected Program:

```python
import re

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        # Use regex to find and remove the shortest possible substrings
        while 'map' in s or 'pie' in s:
            s = re.sub(r'map|pie', '', s)
        print(len(s))
```

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic of counting "pie" after removing "map". Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
