Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program is flawed because it simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s` and prints their sum. This approach does not ensure that the minimum number of characters are removed to make the string beautiful.

For example, consider the string "mmapnapie":
- The program would count "map" as 1 and "pie" as 1, resulting in a total of 2 deletions.
- However, to make the string beautiful, we only need to remove the 4th and 9th characters, which results in the string "mmnapie", where neither "map" nor "pie" appears.

Therefore, the program does not find the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
