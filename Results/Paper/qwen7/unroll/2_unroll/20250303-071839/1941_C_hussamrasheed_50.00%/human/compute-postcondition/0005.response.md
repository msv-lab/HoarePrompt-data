Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t`, followed by `t` pairs of an integer `n` and a string `s`. It then counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' and 'pie' in each string `s`, sums these counts, and prints the result for each test case. The function does not return any value but outputs the sum of counts of 'map' and 'pie' for each input string.**
