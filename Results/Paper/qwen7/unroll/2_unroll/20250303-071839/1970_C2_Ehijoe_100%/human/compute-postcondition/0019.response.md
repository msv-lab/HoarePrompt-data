Postcondition: **`moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is still an empty list, `start` is an input integer, `empty` is still True, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each value is a list containing up to `n-1` integers representing the adjacent nodes to the corresponding key, `leaves` is a deque containing all the keys from `nodes` whose length is 1, and if `moves` is not empty, then the postcondition follows the conditions specified in the if part; otherwise, `moves` is an empty list.**
