Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the string `s`.

2. **Generating a Rearranged String**:
   - For each string `s`, the program generates a new string `s2` by shuffling the characters of `s` using `random.sample(s, len(s))`.
   - This method ensures that `s2` is a permutation of `s`.

3. **Checking for Non-Equality**:
   - The program checks if `s` is not equal to `s2` using the condition `if s != s2:`.
   - If they are not equal, it prints "Yes" followed by `s2`.
   - If they are equal, it prints "No".

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs "Yes" or "No" in the required format.
   - It also outputs the rearranged string `s2` if `s` and `s2` are different.

### Edge Cases:
- **Strings with All Characters the Same**: 
  - For strings like `"aaaaa"` or `"hhhhhhh"`, the shuffled string `s2` will always be the same as `s`. In such cases, the program correctly outputs "No".
- **Strings with Unique Characters**:
  - For strings like `"codeforces"`, the shuffled string `s2` will likely be different from `s`, and the program correctly outputs "Yes" followed by `s2`.
- **Strings with Few Characters**:
  - For very short strings like `"co"`, `"d"`, the program still works correctly by generating a different permutation if possible.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to check if a rearranged string `s2` can be formed from `s` that is not equal to `s`. It handles all edge cases appropriately and follows the problem constraints.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
