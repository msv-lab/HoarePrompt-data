Output State: The output consists of multiple lines. For each test case, if the string `s` is not a palindrome (a string that reads the same backward as forward), it prints 'Yes' followed by a randomly shuffled version of the string `s`. If the string `s` is a palindrome, it prints 'No'. The number of lines printed is equal to the number of test cases entered by the user. Each test case is processed independently, and the outcome (whether 'Yes' or 'No') and the shuffled string (if applicable) depend on the specific input string `s` for that test case.
