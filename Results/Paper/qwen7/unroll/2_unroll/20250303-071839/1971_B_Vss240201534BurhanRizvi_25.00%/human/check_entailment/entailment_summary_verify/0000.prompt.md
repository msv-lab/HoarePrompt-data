You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it generates a random permutation of the string `s` and checks if the original string is different from the permutation. If they are different, it prints 'Yes' followed by the random permutation; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program uses random shuffling to generate a new string `s2` from the input string `s`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the generated string `s2` will always be different from `s`. There is a chance, albeit small, that the shuffled string `s2` might end up being the same as the original string `s`.

For example, consider the input string `aaaaa`. No matter how many times the program runs, the shuffled result could still be `aaaaa`, which would lead the program to print "No", even though a different arrangement exists (e.g., `aaaba`).

To ensure the program works correctly, it should check all possible permutations of the string `s` to find at least one that is different from `s`. This can be done using a permutation generation algorithm or by leveraging Python's itertools.permutations.
