Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it takes three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9) as inputs and returns a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It processes each set of these integers and produces a specific output for each test case, though the exact nature of the output is not specified in the given information.
