Output State: **`nabors` is an input integer, and all other variables (t, n, m, k, a, b) retain their initial states.**

Explanation: The code `nabors = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `nabors`. This means `nabors` now holds the value of the integer input, while the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
