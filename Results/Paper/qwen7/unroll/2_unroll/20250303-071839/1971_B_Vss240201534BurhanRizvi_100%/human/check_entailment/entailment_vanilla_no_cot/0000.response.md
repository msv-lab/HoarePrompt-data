Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not always generate a different string `r` from `s`. Specifically, the solution uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` which may return the same string `s` if the string `s` consists of unique characters. Additionally, the check `if s == s2:` is unnecessary because `random.sample` should inherently avoid generating the exact same string unless the string has unique characters. 

To fix this, we need to ensure that the generated string `s2` is guaranteed to be different from `s`. One way to do this is to swap two characters in the string if the string has more than one unique character. Here is an improved version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            # Ensure s2 is different from s
            s2 = list(s)
            if len(set(s)) > 1:
                i, j = 0, 1
                while s[i] == s[j]:
                    j += 1
                s2[i], s2[j] = s2[j], s2[i]
            else:
                i, j = 0, 1
                while s[i] == s[j]:
                    j += 1
                s2[i], s2[j] = s2[j], s2[i]
            s2 = ''.join(s2)
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
```

This version ensures that `s2` is different from `s` by swapping two distinct characters if they exist. If all characters are the same, it still handles the case correctly by finding two positions with the same character.
