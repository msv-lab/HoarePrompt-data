Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the position Vasya occupied in the line, `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, both `q` and `x` satisfy 1 ≤ `x` < `q` ≤ 10^9, `M` is an empty list, `w` is the square root of `q`.**

The code calculates the square root of `q` and assigns it to the variable `w`. The values of `q`, `x`, and `M` remain unchanged.
