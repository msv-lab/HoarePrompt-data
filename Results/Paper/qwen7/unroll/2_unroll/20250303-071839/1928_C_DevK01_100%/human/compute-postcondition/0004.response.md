Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the position Vasya occupied in the line, `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, both `q` and `x` satisfy 1 ≤ `x` < `q` ≤ 10^9, `M` is a list containing one element which is `w`, `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [w]` appends the value of `w` (which is the square root of `q`) to the list `M`. Since `w` is already defined as an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`, the list `M` now contains this single element. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
