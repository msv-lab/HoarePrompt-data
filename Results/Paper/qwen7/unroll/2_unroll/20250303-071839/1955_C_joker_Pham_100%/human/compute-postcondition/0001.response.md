Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is 0.**

The code initializes a new variable `sunks` and assigns it the value 0. All other variables retain their initial values from the precondition.
