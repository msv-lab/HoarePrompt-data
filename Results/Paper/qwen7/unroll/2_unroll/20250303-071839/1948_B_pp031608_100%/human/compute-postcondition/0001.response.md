State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `n` which is used as the range parameter for the `range(n)` function.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer and it must be within the specified range (2 ≤ n ≤ 50).
3. The variable `t` is not used in the loop head, so its current state does not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `t`.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` meets the condition for the loop to execute, which is `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
