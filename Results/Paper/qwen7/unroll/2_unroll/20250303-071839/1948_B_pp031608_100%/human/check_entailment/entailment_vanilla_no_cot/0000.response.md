Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Sorted Order**: The program checks if `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]` can be made equal after splitting `arr[i]`. However, the logic to check if it's possible to sort the array by splitting elements is flawed. It only checks if the combined list of digits is sorted but does not ensure that the transformation process can achieve a fully sorted array.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Splitting Elements**: The program assumes that if the combined list of digits is sorted, then the original elements can be transformed into a sorted array. This is not always true because the transformation process involves inserting digits back into the array in their original positions, which may disrupt the sorting order.

3. **Inefficient and Incorrect Loop Direction**: The loop direction in the check (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)` and `if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`) is incorrect for determining if the array can be sorted. The correct approach should involve checking from the beginning of the array to ensure the smallest elements come first.

A correct solution would involve a different approach, such as simulating the splitting process and ensuring that the resulting array can be sorted. Hereâ€™s a more appropriate way to solve the problem:

```python
def can_sort_array(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            # Try to split arr[i+1] and see if we can make the array sorted
            split_arr = [int(digit) for digit in str(arr[i + 1])]
            if sorted(split_arr) == split_arr and min(split_arr) >= arr[i]:
                arr[i] = split_arr[0]
                arr.pop(i + 1)
                return can_sort_array(arr)
            else:
                return False
    return True

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if can_sort_array(arr):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This solution recursively tries to split elements and check if the array can be sorted after each split, ensuring the logic is correct and the array can be transformed into a sorted one.
