Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; a is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9); m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; and queries is a list of m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; r is a lambda function that maps integers from input split by spaces.**

The code defines a lambda function `r` that takes input split by spaces and maps it to integers. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, or `queries`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
