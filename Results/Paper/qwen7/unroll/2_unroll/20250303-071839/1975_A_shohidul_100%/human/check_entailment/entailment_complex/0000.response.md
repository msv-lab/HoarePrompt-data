Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
3. It first checks if the array `a` is already non-decreasing (`check_all`).
4. If the array is not non-decreasing, it attempts to find a split point `i` such that the prefix `[0:i]` is non-decreasing and the suffix `[i:n]` is non-increasing.
5. The logic for checking the split point is correct. If such a split is found, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the function correctly implements the required logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing through the specified operations.

Correctness: **True**
