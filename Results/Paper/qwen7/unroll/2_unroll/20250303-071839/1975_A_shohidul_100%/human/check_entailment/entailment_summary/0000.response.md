Reasoning:
1. The problem requires checking if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
2. The provided code attempts to solve this by:
   - Reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, reading the size `n` and the array `a`.
   - Checking if the array `a` is already non-decreasing using `check_all`.
   - If not, it tries to find a valid split point where the left part is non-decreasing and the right part is non-increasing.
3. The logic in the code seems to correctly implement the required checks:
   - It first checks if the entire array is already non-decreasing.
   - If not, it iterates through possible split points to find a valid split where the left part is non-decreasing and the right part is non-increasing.
4. The code uses appropriate conditions and checks to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by the described operations.
5. The output is correctly formatted as "YES" or "NO".

Given the above reasoning, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
