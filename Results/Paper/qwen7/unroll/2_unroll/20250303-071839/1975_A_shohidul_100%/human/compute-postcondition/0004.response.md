Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it checks if the list `a` is non-decreasing or can be split into two segments: a non-decreasing segment followed by a non-increasing segment. If any of these conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, but `t` is not an explicit parameter of the function.**
