### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that he can conduct `m` rounds, with each round having at least one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, the first line contains two integers `n` and `m`, representing the number of problems already available and the number of rounds, respectively.
   - The second line is a string `a` containing the difficulty levels of the existing problems.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `a`.
   - It initializes an array `count` of size 7 (to keep track of the counts of each difficulty level).
   - It iterates through the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` array for each character.
   - It then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level by comparing the current count with the required `m` for each level.
   - Finally, it sums up the needed problems for all difficulty levels and returns this value.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles cases where the existing problems already meet the requirement for some difficulty levels.
   - It ensures that the total number of additional problems needed is calculated accurately.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems needed. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
