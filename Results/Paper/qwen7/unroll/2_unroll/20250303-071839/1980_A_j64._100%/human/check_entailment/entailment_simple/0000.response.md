Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and the string `a`. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It initializes a list `count` of size 7 to keep track of the number of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the string `a`.
   - It iterates over each character in the string `a`, updating the corresponding index in the `count` list.
   - It then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level by comparing the current count with `m` and adding the difference to `needed_problems`.
   - Finally, it returns the total number of additional problems needed.

3. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating `needed_problems` is correct. For each difficulty level, if the count is less than `m`, the difference `m - count[i]` is added to `needed_problems`. This ensures that Vlad will have at least `m` problems for each difficulty level.
   - The formula `7*m - (sum of all counts)` is equivalent to summing up the differences for each difficulty level where the count is less than `m`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n, m, a)` for each test case, which is the correct approach.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed.

Correctness: **True**
