#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
        
    #State: count is [number of A's, number of B's, number of C's, number of D's, number of E's, number of F's, number of G's] in the string a.
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `count` is [number of A's, number of B's, number of C's, number of D's, number of E's, number of F's, number of G's], `needed_problems` is 7*m - (number of A's + number of B's + number of C's + number of D's + number of E's + number of F's + number of G's).
    #
    #In this output state, the `count` array remains the same as in the initial state because the loop does not modify the counts of each character. The `needed_problems` variable is updated to 7*m minus the total count of all characters in the string `a`, where `m` is the threshold value used in the loop condition.
    return needed_problems
    #The program returns the value of `needed_problems` which is calculated as 7*m minus the total count of all characters (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) in the `count` array.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `a`. `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive; `m` is an integer between 1 and 5; and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function calculates and returns the value of `needed_problems`, which is determined as 7 times `m` minus the total count of all characters (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) in the string `a`.
