You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 32. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It then counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string. Based on whether the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', it prints either 'A' or 'B'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Counting**: For each string, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'.
   - It uses two counters `l` and `h` to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', respectively.
3. **Comparison and Output**: After counting, it compares the counts and prints the character ('A' or 'B') that appears more frequently.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there is a tie between 'A' and 'B' (i.e., both counters have the same value), the program will still print one of the characters based on the comparison. However, the problem statement specifies that all strings are distinct, so ties should not occur.
5. **Output Format**: The program outputs the required character for each test case in the specified format.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program seems to handle all cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program logic is sound and should work as expected for the given problem.

**Correctness: **True**
