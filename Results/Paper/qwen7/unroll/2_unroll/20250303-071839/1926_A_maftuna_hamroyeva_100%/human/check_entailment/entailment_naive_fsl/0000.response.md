Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each test case and prints the character that appears most frequently. Given the constraints and the logic used, the program handles all potential cases correctly. For strings of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B', the program will always produce the correct output. Since no specific edge cases were found where the program fails, we can conclude that the program is correct.
