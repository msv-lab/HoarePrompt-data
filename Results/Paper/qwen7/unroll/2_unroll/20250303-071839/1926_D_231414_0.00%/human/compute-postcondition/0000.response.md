Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `times` ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `times = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `times`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` (which is equivalent to `times` in this context) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the same condition applies to `times` after the code is executed. The other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
