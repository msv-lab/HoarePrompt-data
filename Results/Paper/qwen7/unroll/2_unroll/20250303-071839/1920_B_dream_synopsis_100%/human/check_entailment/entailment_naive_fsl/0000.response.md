Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where Bob multiplies elements by -1 optimally. Specifically, the program does not consider the scenario where Bob can multiply the smallest negative elements by -1 to minimize the sum. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 1 1
-3 -1 1 2
```

- The initial sum of the array is \(-3 - 1 + 1 + 2 = 0\).
- Alice removes one element, say \(-3\). The array becomes \([-1, 1, 2]\).
- Bob can multiply \(-1\) by -1 to get \(1\), making the array \([1, 1, 2]\).

The optimal sum in this case should be \(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\), but the program incorrectly calculates the sum as 0.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the optimal strategy for Bob to minimize the sum after Alice has removed her elements.
