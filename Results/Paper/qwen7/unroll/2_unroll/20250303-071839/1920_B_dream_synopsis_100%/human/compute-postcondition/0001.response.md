Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n. The array a consists of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for all i. After executing the loop, ans contains the maximum value among the calculated sums for each iteration of the loop, and the final printed output is the maximum value in ans. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
