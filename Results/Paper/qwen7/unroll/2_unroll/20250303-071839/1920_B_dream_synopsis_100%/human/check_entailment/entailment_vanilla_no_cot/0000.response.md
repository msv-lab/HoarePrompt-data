Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `sums`:**
   - The logic for calculating `sums` is flawed. Specifically, the way `sums` is updated and appended to `ans` does not correctly reflect the optimal strategy for both players.
   
2. **Optimal Strategy Not Properly Implemented:**
   - Alice's goal is to maximize the sum by removing the smallest elements, and Bob's goal is to minimize the sum by negating the largest elements.
   - The current implementation does not properly account for these strategies. For example, it incorrectly calculates the effect of Alice's removals and Bob's negations.

3. **Logic for Updating `sums`:**
   - The loop where `sums` is updated and appended to `ans` does not correctly simulate the game's turns. It should consider the optimal sequence of moves by both players, which is not accurately represented in the current code.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Sort the Array:**
   - Sort the array to easily identify the smallest and largest elements.

2. **Handle Alice's Removals:**
   - Alice will remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. If she removes more than `k` elements, she will remove the smallest `k` elements.

3. **Handle Bob's Negations:**
   - Bob will negate the largest elements to minimize the sum. If he negates more than `x` elements, he will negate the largest `x` elements.

4. **Calculate the Final Sum:**
   - After considering Alice's and Bob's optimal moves, calculate the final sum of the array.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()

        # Alice removes the smallest k elements
        if k < n:
            a = a[k:]

        # Bob negates the largest x elements
        if x > 0:
            a = a[:n-x] + [-i for i in a[n-x:]]

        # Calculate the final sum
        print(sum(a))

# Example usage
func()
```

This approach ensures that both players play optimally according to their respective goals.
