To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `ans`.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\).
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\).
   - `ans` is the maximum value between all `i` and `x // i` where `i` is a divisor of `x` and either `n \leq x // i` or `n \leq i`.

2. **Understanding `ans`**:
   - We need to find the maximum value between `i` and `x // i` for all divisors `i` of `x` that satisfy one of the conditions: `n \leq x // i` or `n \leq i`.
   - For any divisor `i` of `x`, `x // i` is also a divisor of `x`.

3. **Key Insight**:
   - If `n` is a divisor of `x`, then both `n` and `x // n` are considered.
   - The maximum value between `n` and `x // n` will be the larger of these two values.

Given this insight, `ans` will be the maximum of `n` and `x // n`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `n` is a positive integer and \(1 \leq n \leq x\), and considering the properties of divisors, the value of `ans` will be the maximum of `n` and `x // n`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the maximum of `n` and `x // n`.

Output: **max(n, x // n)**
