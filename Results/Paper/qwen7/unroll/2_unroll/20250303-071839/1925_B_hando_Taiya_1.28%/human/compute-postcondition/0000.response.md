Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, and the values of `x` and `n` are assigned the integer values from the input split.**

This means that the variable `t` retains its initial state as a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, while `x` and `n` are assigned the integer values from the input split by the `map(int, input().split())` function. The values of `x` and `n` are constrained such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
