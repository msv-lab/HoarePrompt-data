Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases (`tc`) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `n`, which represent the total difficulty and the number of sub-problems, respectively.
3. The function `func_1()` calculates the maximum balance by iterating through all divisors of `x` and checking if they can form a valid partition of `x` into `n` sub-problems.
4. The logic inside `func_1()` checks both `i` and `x // i` as potential balances, ensuring that the conditions `n <= x // i` or `n <= i` are met.
5. The final output is the maximum balance found, which is printed correctly.

Given the logic and the steps taken, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
