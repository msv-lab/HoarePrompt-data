Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, and `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `ans` along with the unchanged values of `t`, `x`, and `n`.
