You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code:

    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10⁸, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, and `ans` is the maximum value between all `i` and `x // i` where `i` is a divisor of `x` and either `n` ≤ `x // i` or `n` ≤ `i`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: max(n, x // n)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( x \), and \( n \) where \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^3 \), \( 1 \leq x \leq 10^8 \), and \( 1 \leq n \leq x \). For each test case, it calculates and returns the maximum value between \( n \) and \( x // n \).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up the Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - This part is correct and follows the problem statement.

2. **Defining the Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is incorrect because the function should be called within the loop to process each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - Inside the loop, the function `func_1` is called, which takes the values of `x` and `n` from the input.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. This is correct as we need to find the maximum balance.
   - A loop runs from `1` to `isqrt(x) + 1` to check all possible divisors of `x`.
     - If `x % i == 0`, it means `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - The condition `n <= x // i` checks if the number of sub-problems (`n`) can be accommodated with each sub-problem having a difficulty of `i`.
     - Similarly, the condition `n <= i` checks if the number of sub-problems can be accommodated with each sub-problem having a difficulty of `x // i`.
     - The maximum of these two values is taken and stored in `ans`.
   - Finally, the result `ans` is printed.

### Correctness Check:

- The logic inside `func_1` is correct for finding the maximum balance.
- However, the function `func_1` is not being called correctly in the main loop. Instead of calling `func_1()`, it should call `func_1(x, n)`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = func_1(x, n)
    print(ans)

def func_1(x, n):
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    return ans
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect because it does not call `func_1` with the correct parameters. After correcting this, the program should work as intended.

**Correctness: False**
