Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks, where each polygon must have equal sides and no stick can be used more than once.
2. The annotated program correctly calculates the frequencies of each stick length using a dictionary (`freq`).
3. The logic in `func_1` iterates over the values in `freq` and performs integer division by 4 for each value. This is because a regular polygon with \( k \) sides requires \( k \) sticks of the same length. Since we are trying to maximize the number of such polygons, we take the integer division of the frequency of each stick length by 4.
4. Summing these results gives the total number of polygons that can be constructed.
5. Given the constraints (1 ≤ n, a_i ≤ 100), the program should handle all valid inputs correctly as per the problem statement.

Based on this analysis, the program logic matches the problem requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
