Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for n in arr:`. Here, the objects involved are `n` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers representing the lengths of sticks.
   - `n` is a variable that will take on the values from the list `arr` one by one.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `arr`. Once `arr` is exhausted, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. The value of `n` will change during each iteration but initially, it doesn't matter what `n` is since the loop will start with the first element of `arr`.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `arr` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element**.
