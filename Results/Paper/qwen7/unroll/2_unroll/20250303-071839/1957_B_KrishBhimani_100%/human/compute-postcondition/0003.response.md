Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) are processed. The function returns a result based on the given conditions for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for `t`, followed by pairs of values for `n` and `k`. For each pair, the function performs some unspecified operation and returns the result accordingly.
