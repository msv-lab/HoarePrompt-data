The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \). If \( n \) is 1, it prints \( k \). Otherwise, it calculates two numbers: a power of 2 (or 0 if \( n \) is 1) and the remaining value after subtracting this power of 2 from \( k \). It then fills the rest of the list with zeros up to length \( n \) and prints these values. The function implicitly takes the number of test cases \( t \) as input through user input, and outputs the results for each test case.
