Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)**.

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` remains within this range after the code is executed. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
