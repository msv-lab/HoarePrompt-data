### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the values of `n` (number of coins) and `k` (number of jewels).
   - It checks if `n < k`. If true, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy any jewels.
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with the price equal to `n` (since Alice will buy all her coins worth of jewels in one stall).
   - If `n > k`, it further checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. If true, it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls: the first stall with price `n - k + 1` and the second stall with price `1`.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NO".

3. **Stall Setup and Pricing**:
   - The program attempts to handle the case where `n > k` and `k - 1 < n - k + 1` by setting up 2 stalls. However, this logic is flawed. The problem requires setting up at most 60 stalls, but the current logic only considers 2 stalls.
   - The example test cases show that more than 2 stalls may be necessary to achieve the desired outcome. For instance, in the third test case, 8 stalls are needed, which the current implementation does not account for.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program should output the number of stalls and the prices for each stall if the answer is "YES". The current implementation only handles the case of 1 or 2 stalls, which is insufficient.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the general case where more than 2 stalls are required. Specifically, it fails to meet the requirement of setting up at most 60 stalls and providing the correct prices for those stalls when necessary.

### Correctness:
**False**
