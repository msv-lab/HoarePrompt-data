Functionality: **The function processes test cases where it takes two integers \( n \) and \( k \) as inputs. It checks if \( n \) is less than, equal to, or greater than \( k \). Depending on the comparison, it prints either "YES" or "NO" along with some integers. After processing, \( n \) and \( k \) remain unchanged.**
