Postcondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. If n equals k, no changes are made to n and k. Otherwise, if k - 1 < n - k + 1 holds true, no changes are made to n and k. If none of these conditions apply, n and k remain unchanged.**
