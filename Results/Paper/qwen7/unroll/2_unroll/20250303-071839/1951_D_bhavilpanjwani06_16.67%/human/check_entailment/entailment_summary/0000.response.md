Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. **Comparison Logic**:
   - If \( n < k \), the program correctly identifies it as impossible to buy exactly \( k \) jewels and prints "NO".
   - If \( n = k \), the program incorrectly prints "YES" and suggests setting up 1 stall with \( n \) coins. However, Alice would buy 1 jewel and be left with \( n - 1 \) coins, which means she cannot buy exactly \( k \) jewels. This logic is flawed.
   - If \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \), the program incorrectly prints "YES" and suggests setting up 2 stalls with prices \( n - k + 1 \) and 1. This logic is also flawed because it doesn't ensure Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.
3. **Output Format**:
   - The program should output the number of stalls and their respective prices when the answer is "YES". However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly for the cases where \( n > k \).

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the solution for all cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
