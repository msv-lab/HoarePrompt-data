Output State: **`x` is 1, `cnt` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them into integers, assigning the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `m`. The values of `x` and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial state.
