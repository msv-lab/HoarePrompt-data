State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, nalla is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `nalla` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
2. The loop iterates over the range defined by `t`, meaning `nalla` will take on values from 0 up to `t-1`.
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (since `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`, and `t` must be at least 1).
4. The initial value of `nalla` is 0, which is correct for the first iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is within the specified range, and `nalla` is correctly set to 0.
