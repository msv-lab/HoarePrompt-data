Output State: t lines, each line containing an integer length followed by a sequence of characters from the set {'0', '1', '-1'}. The integer length represents the modified length of the binary representation after processing, and the sequence of characters represents the processed binary string with some digits possibly changed to '1', '-1', or '0'. Each line corresponds to the processed binary representation of the input integer x for each iteration of the outer loop.
