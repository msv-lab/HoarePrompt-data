### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program logic adheres to the problem requirements. Let's break down the key points and verify them against the problem description:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program constructs a binary representation of `x` using a list `s`.
   - It iterates from `0` to `29` (since `2^30` is the upper limit), checking if the `i-th` bit of `x` is set (`1`) or not (`0`).
   - This part is correct and ensures that the binary representation of `x` is stored in `s`.

3. **Adjusting for Constraints:**
   - The program then iterates through the bits of `s` to ensure no two consecutive non-zero bits exist.
   - If a `1` is found, it checks if the next bit is also `1`. If so, it changes the current bit to `-1` and sets a flag.
   - If the flag is set and the current bit is `0`, it changes the current bit to `1`.
   - These adjustments are designed to ensure no two consecutive non-zero bits exist, which is correct.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the last bit might need adjustment and ensures the final result meets the constraints.
   - If the last bit is `0` and the flag is set, it changes the last bit to `1` and increments the length.
   - If the flag is still set, it appends a `1` to the end of the list and increments the length.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the resulting list `s` and then prints the list itself.
   - This output format matches the required format specified in the problem statement.

### Verification

1. **Binary Representation Construction:**
   - The program correctly constructs the binary representation of `x` as a list of `'1'`, `'0'`, and `'-'` characters.

2. **Constraint Enforcement:**
   - The program enforces the constraint that no two consecutive non-zero bits exist by converting `11` to `-1` and adjusting subsequent bits accordingly.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where the last bit might need adjustment, ensuring the final result is valid.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs the length and the modified binary representation in the correct format.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and verifying each step against the problem requirements, we confirm that the program logic is sound and adheres to the problem constraints. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final: True**
