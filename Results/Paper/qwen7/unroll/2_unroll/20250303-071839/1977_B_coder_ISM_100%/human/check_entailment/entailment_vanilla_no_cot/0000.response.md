Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but has several issues:

1. **Bitwise Representation**: The initial approach to convert `x` into a binary representation using bitwise operations is correct. However, the subsequent logic to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements is flawed.

2. **Handling Consecutive Non-Zero Elements**: The logic to handle consecutive non-zero elements is incorrect. Specifically, the part where it tries to replace `-1` with `0` and `1` with `-1` if they are consecutive is unnecessary and complicates the solution. This part can be removed entirely because the initial construction already ensures no two consecutive non-zero elements.

3. **Length Calculation**: The length of the array should always be determined by the number of bits required to represent `x`, which is at most 30 (since \(2^{30}\) is the upper limit). The current implementation unnecessarily increases the length in some cases.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        for i in range(30):
            if x & (1 << i):
                s.append('1')
            else:
                s.append('0')
        # Ensure the array is of length 30
        while len(s) < 30:
            s.append('0')
        print(30)
        print(*s)

func()
```

This version correctly constructs the array and ensures it is of length 30, which satisfies the problem constraints.
