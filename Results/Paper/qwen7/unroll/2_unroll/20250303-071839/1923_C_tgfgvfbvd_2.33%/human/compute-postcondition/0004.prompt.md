You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, each test case consists of n and q where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, an array c of length n where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and q queries defined by pairs of integers l_i and r_i such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = []
        
        c = 0
        
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The program processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it first reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\), then an array \(l\) of length \(n\). It calculates a prefix sum array \(p\) where each element \(p[i]\) is the sum of the first \(i+1\) elements of \(l\). Then, for each of the \(m\) queries, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\), and determines whether the sum of the subarray from index \(a-1\) to \(b-1\) is at least twice the length of this subarray. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The output state includes the results of all these queries for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs consisting of a positive integer `t`, followed by `n` and `q` (where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5), an array `c` of length `n` with each element being a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and `q` queries defined by pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. For each query, it returns the sum of elements in the subarray from index `l_i` to `r_i` in the array `c`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
