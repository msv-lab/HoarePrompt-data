Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object here is the input value used in the range function, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: The loop will execute as long as the input value (which is converted to an integer) is greater than 0. Given that `t` is a positive integer, it means the input will always be a positive integer, ensuring the loop will execute.

3. **List the necessary adjustments**: Since the loop will always execute given the initial state of `t`, no specific adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. However, we should note that the loop will read input from the user for each iteration.

4. **Formulate the final state**: The only state that needs to be considered is the input value, which is `int(input())`. Since `t` is a positive integer, the loop will always execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer**
