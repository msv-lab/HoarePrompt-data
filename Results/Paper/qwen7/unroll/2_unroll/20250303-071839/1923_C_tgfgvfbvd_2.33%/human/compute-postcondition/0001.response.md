Output State: The program processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it first reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\), then an array \(l\) of length \(n\). It calculates a prefix sum array \(p\) from \(l\). Then, for each of the \(m\) queries defined by pairs of integers \(a\) and \(b\), it checks if the sum of elements from index \(a-1\) to \(b-1\) in \(l\) is at least twice the number of elements in the range. If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all queries for a test case, it moves on to the next test case.
