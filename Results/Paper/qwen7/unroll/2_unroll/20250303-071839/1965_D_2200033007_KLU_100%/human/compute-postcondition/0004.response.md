Output State: `a` is a list of length `n` where the first half of the list (including the middle element if `n` is odd) is filled with the values from the `odds` list, and the second half is mirrored such that `a[i] = a[n-1-i]` for each `i` in the range of the first half of the list. `odds` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `prev` is the last value from the `odds` list, and `idx` is `-1`.
