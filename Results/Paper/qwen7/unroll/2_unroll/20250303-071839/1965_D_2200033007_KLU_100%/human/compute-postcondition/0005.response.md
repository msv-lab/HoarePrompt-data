Output State: `a` is a list of length `n` where the first half of the elements are calculated based on the values in `odds`. For each element at index `i` (where `i <= (n - 1) // 2`), `a[i]` and `a[n - 1 - i]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2` for the corresponding `x` in `odds`. The last element `a[n-1]` is set to the last value in `odds`. All other elements in `a` remain 0. `odds` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same, `prev` is the last value in `odds`, and `idx` is `-1`.
