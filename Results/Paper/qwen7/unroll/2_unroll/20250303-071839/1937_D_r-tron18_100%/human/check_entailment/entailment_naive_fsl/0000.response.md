Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the given rules. Specifically, the program attempts to use a mathematical approach to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid, but this approach does not accurately reflect the behavior described in the problem statement.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  <><
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1 4 2 
  ```

However, the provided program does not produce the correct output. For example, when the pinball starts at the second cell (`i=2`), it should take 4 seconds to leave the grid, but the program incorrectly calculates a different value.

The program's logic seems to be based on accumulated values and indices without properly simulating the pinball's movement step-by-step according to the rules provided. This discrepancy indicates that the program does not correctly implement the described behavior for all potential cases.
