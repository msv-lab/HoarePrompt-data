The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `times`. It returns the last element of `arr` minus the maximum of the last element of `arr` or the element at index `max(-len(arr), -1 - times)` in `arr`. This means if `times` is non-positive, it subtracts the last element of `arr` from itself, resulting in zero. If `times` is positive, it subtracts either the last element of `arr` or the element at the calculated index, whichever is greater.
