Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic and the implementation step-by-step.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is `'>'.`
   - `totalOne` is the count of `'>'.`
   - `preOne` is the prefix sum of `pre`.
   - `suffZero` is initialized with `[0]`.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - Iterate backward through the string `s1`.
   - For each character `el`:
     - If `el` is `'>'`, calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using the formula involving `func_1`.
     - If `el` is `'<'`, update `suffZero` and calculate the time similarly.

3. **`func_1`**:
   - This function calculates a difference between two elements in a list, adjusted by the index.

### Key Points:
- The logic in `func_2` aims to calculate the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
- The use of prefix sums (`preOne`) and suffix sums (`suffZero`) helps in efficiently calculating the required times.
- The formulas used in `func_2` are derived from the movement rules and the inversion of directions.

### Verification:
- The code correctly initializes the necessary variables.
- The main loop iterates through the string in reverse, ensuring that the pinball's movement is calculated accurately.
- The formulas used in `func_1` and their application in `func_2` seem to follow the problem's requirements.

Given the complexity and the detailed calculations, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
