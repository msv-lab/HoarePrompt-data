Output State: **`preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all elements in `pre` up to that index, starting from 0; `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is the length of `pre`; `suffZero` is a list containing the value `[0]`.**

Explanation: The line `suffZero = [0]` initializes a new list `suffZero` with a single element `0`. This does not affect the values of `preOne`, `pre`, or `totalOne`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
