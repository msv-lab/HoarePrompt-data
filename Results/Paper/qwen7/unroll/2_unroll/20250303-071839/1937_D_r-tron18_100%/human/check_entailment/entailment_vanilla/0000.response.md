Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n` with characters `<` and `>`.
   - A pinball starts at a specific cell and moves left or right based on the character.
   - The character at the current cell is inverted after each move.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.
   - We need to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code includes two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is a helper function that calculates a value based on an array and a time parameter.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes the input string and calculates the time for each cell.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is not directly related to the main logic but seems to be used in `func_2`.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Initializes a list `pre` containing positions where the character is `>` and calculates `totalOne` (number of `>`).
   - Uses `accumulate` to create `preOne`, which stores cumulative sums of positions.
   - Initializes `suffZero` to store suffix sums of positions where the character is `<`.
   - Iterates backward through the string to calculate the time for each cell:
     - For each cell, it checks if the character is `>` or `<`.
     - Depending on the character, it calculates `zeroInd` and `oneInd` using different formulas.
     - Updates `preOne` and `totalOne` accordingly.
   - Prints the results.

### Correctness Check

1. **Initialization and Preprocessing**:
   - The preprocessing steps seem correct. `pre` and `preOne` are correctly initialized based on the input string.
   - `suffZero` is also correctly initialized as a suffix sum array.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The logic inside the loop for calculating `zeroInd` and `oneInd` appears to be correct based on the problem constraints.
   - The updates to `preOne` and `totalOne` are done correctly.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles both cases (`>` and `<`) correctly by updating the necessary variables.
   - The use of suffix and prefix sums ensures that the calculations are efficient.

4. **Output**:
   - The final output is printed correctly, showing the time taken for each cell.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the logic and implementation are correct based on the problem description. The code handles all necessary steps and edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
