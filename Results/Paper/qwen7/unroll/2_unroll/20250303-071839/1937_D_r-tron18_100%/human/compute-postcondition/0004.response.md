Output State: **`ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all elements in `pre` up to that index, starting from 0; `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is the length of `pre`; `suffZero` is a list containing the value `[0]`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` zeros. This operation does not affect the values of `preOne`, `pre`, `totalOne`, or `suffZero`. Therefore, these variables retain their original states, and only `ans` is updated to a list of `n` zeros.
