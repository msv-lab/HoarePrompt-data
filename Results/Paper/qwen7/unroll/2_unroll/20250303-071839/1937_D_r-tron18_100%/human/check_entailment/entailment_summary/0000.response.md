Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic implemented in `func_2` aligns with the problem statement and the expected behavior of the pinball movement.

### Problem Analysis:
- The pinball starts at a specific cell and moves based on the direction (`<` or `>`) of the cell.
- After each move, the direction of the cell is reversed.
- The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `pre` is a list of indices where the direction is `'>'.`
   - `totalOne` is the count of `'>'.`
   - `preOne` is the prefix sum of `pre` with an initial value of 0.
   - `suffZero` is a list starting with 0, which will be updated to store suffix sums of positions.
   - `ans` is initialized as a list of zeros, which will store the time taken for each cell.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop iterates backward through the string `s1`.
   - For each cell, it calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid based on the number of `'>'.` to the left and the positions to the right.
   - The calculations involve using the `func_1` function to compute certain values based on the prefix and suffix sums.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - When the current cell's direction is `'>',` it calculates the time based on the number of `'>'.` to the left and the positions to the right.
   - When the current cell's direction is `'<'`, it updates the `suffZero` list and calculates the time similarly but considering the positions to the left.

### Verification:
- The logic in `func_2` correctly handles the movement of the pinball and the reversal of directions.
- The calculations for the time taken to leave the grid are consistent with the problem statement.
- The use of prefix and suffix sums helps in efficiently calculating the required values without redundant computations.

Given the detailed analysis, the implementation in `func_2` appears to correctly simulate the pinball movement and calculate the required times.

Correctness: **True**
