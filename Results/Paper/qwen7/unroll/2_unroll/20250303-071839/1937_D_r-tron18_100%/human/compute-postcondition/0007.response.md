Output State: **ans is a list of n elements, preOne is an empty list, totalOne is 0, suffZero is a list containing the value [0].**

Explanation: The loop iterates over the string `s1` in reverse order. Depending on whether the character is '>', the `ans` list is updated with specific calculations. After processing all characters in `s1`, the `preOne` list is emptied, `totalOne` is set to 0, and `suffZero` remains as `[0]`. The `ans` list contains the calculated values based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
