Output State: **`pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`; `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' where 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The code creates a list comprehension that iterates over the enumerated elements of `s1`. For each index `i` where the element `el` is '>', it adds `i + 1` to the list `pre`. Therefore, `pre` contains the positions (indices + 1) of all '>' characters in `s1`. The initial state of `s1` remains unchanged.
