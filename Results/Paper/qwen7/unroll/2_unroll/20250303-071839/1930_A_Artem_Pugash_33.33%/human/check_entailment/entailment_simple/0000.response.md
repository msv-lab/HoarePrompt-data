Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the list of integers and then repeatedly taking the minimum of the first two elements, which are the smallest available numbers, until the list is empty. This approach ensures that the smallest possible values are always being added to the score at each step, which is optimal for maximizing the score.

Let's break down the steps in the program:
1. It reads the number of test cases (`numCases`).
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - It splits the input string into a list of integers and sorts this list in ascending order.
   - It initializes a variable `suma` to store the cumulative score.
   - It enters a loop where it pops the first two elements from the sorted list, takes their minimum, adds it to `suma`, and continues until the list is empty.
   - Finally, it prints the accumulated score.

Given that the program correctly sorts the list and always pairs the smallest available numbers, it ensures that the score is maximized. The logic is sound and matches the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
