You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = input().split()
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        suma = 0
        while numbers != []:
            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)



- Annotated Code:

        print(suma)
        
    #State: The sum of the minimum values for each pair of sorted integers across all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` indicating the number of pairs, followed by `2n` integers. It sorts these integers and then iterates through them in pairs, summing up the minimum value of each pair. Finally, it prints the total sum for all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`numCases`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `numInteger` (which is `2n`).
   - It then reads the list of integers and splits them into a list of strings.
   
2. **Sorting:**
   - The list of integers is sorted in non-decreasing order using `numbers.sort(reverse=False)`.

3. **Scoring Mechanism:**
   - A while loop runs until the list `numbers` is empty.
   - In each iteration, the smallest two elements (`a` and `b`) are popped from the list.
   - The minimum of these two elements is added to the score (`suma`).

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all pairs, the total score is printed.

### Correctness Check:

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Sorting:**
   - Sorting the list ensures that we always pick the smallest available pair of numbers, which aligns with the requirement to maximize the score by choosing the minimum of any two chosen numbers.

2. **Popping Elements:**
   - Popping the first two elements in each iteration ensures that we are always considering the smallest available numbers at each step.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - Adding the minimum of the two popped elements correctly implements the scoring mechanism described in the problem statement.

4. **Termination:**
   - Since the list is processed completely, all possible pairs are considered, and the algorithm terminates when no more pairs can be formed.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum score by always picking the smallest available pair of numbers. The sorting ensures that the smallest elements are always chosen first, and the while loop ensures that all possible pairs are considered.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
