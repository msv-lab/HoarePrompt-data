Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the score. The issue lies in how the minimum values are being added to the score. Specifically, the program is only popping the first two elements from the sorted list and adding the smaller of the two to the score. This approach does not necessarily yield the maximum possible score.

To achieve the maximum score, we should always add the sum of the smallest pair of numbers in each iteration. The correct approach is to pair the smallest and largest numbers in each iteration, which ensures that the minimum of each pair is maximized over all iterations.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        numbers.sort()
        suma = 0
        while len(numbers) > 1:
            # Take the smallest and the largest number
            a = numbers.pop(0)
            b = numbers.pop(-1)
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the smallest available numbers are paired together in each iteration, thus maximizing the score.
