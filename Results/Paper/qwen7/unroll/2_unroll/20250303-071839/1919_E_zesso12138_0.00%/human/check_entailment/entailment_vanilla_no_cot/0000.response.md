Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Approach in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` attempts to use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to form the prefix sums array `p`. However, the logic used in the dynamic programming approach is flawed. It doesn't correctly account for the constraints and nature of the problem.

2. **Misunderstanding the Problem**: The problem requires counting the number of initial arrays `a` such that their sorted prefix sums match the given sorted prefix sums array `p`. The provided solution does not correctly simulate the process of generating the prefix sums array `a` and checking if they match `p`.

3. **Incorrect Use of Dynamic Programming**: The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` does not accurately model the problem. Specifically, the transitions in the DP table do not correctly reflect the possible values of the prefix sums and how they can be formed from the original array `a`.

4. **Lack of Correct Logic**: The logic inside the nested loops in `func_1` does not correctly handle the generation and validation of the prefix sums array `a`. It seems to be attempting to build a prefix sum array but does not correctly simulate the process of generating `a` from `p`.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. A correct solution would involve a more sophisticated approach, likely involving combinatorial methods or a different dynamic programming strategy that accurately models the problem constraints.
