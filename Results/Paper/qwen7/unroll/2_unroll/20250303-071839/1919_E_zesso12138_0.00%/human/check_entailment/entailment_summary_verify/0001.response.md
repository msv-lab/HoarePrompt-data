### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided program step by step to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding
- We need to count the number of possible initial arrays \( a \) of size \( n \) consisting of only \( 1 \) and \( -1 \) such that the sorted prefix sums match the given \( p \).
- The function `func_1` should compute the number of such arrays.
- The function `func_2` reads input and processes multiple test cases using `func_1`.

#### Function `func_1`
- **DP Table Initialization**: 
  - `dp` is initialized with `dp[offset] = 1`, meaning one way to have a prefix sum of `0` (since `offset = n`).
- **DP Transition**:
  - For each position `i` from `1` to `n`, it updates the DP table `new_dp` by considering the previous state `dp[j]` and adding `1` or `-1` to the prefix sum.
  - This transition ensures that we explore all possible prefix sums up to `2 * n`.
- **Final Calculation**:
  - After processing all positions, the final prefix sum is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`.
  - The value at `dp[final_sum]` gives the number of ways to achieve the desired prefix sums.

#### Function `func_2`
- **Input Handling**:
  - Reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
  - Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The logic of updating the DP table correctly explores all possible prefix sums.
   - The final result is computed correctly by checking the value at the final prefix sum position.
   - However, there is a critical issue in the implementation. The current implementation assumes that the prefix sums can be directly translated into the number of ways to construct the array `a`. This is not always true because the problem requires the sorted prefix sums, and the direct computation might not account for all valid permutations of `1` and `-1`.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the example `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`. The correct number of ways to construct the array `a` is 3, as shown in the problem description.
   - However, the current implementation might not correctly handle the constraints and permutations, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads input correctly and processes each test case independently.
   - It calls `func_1` with the correct parameters and prints the results.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly handle the constraints and permutations required to solve the problem. The dynamic programming approach might miss some valid configurations due to the nature of the problem.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
