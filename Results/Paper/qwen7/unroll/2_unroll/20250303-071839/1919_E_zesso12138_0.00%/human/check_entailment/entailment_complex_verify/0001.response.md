### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding
- We need to count the number of possible initial arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1` such that the sorted prefix sums match the given `p`.
- The function `func_1` should compute the number of such arrays.
- The function `func_2` reads input and processes multiple test cases using `func_1`.

#### Function `func_1`
- **DP Table Initialization**: 
  - `dp` is initialized with `dp[offset] = 1`, meaning one way to have a prefix sum of `0` (since `offset = n`).
- **DP Transition**:
  - For each position `i` from `1` to `n`, it updates the DP table `new_dp` by considering the previous state `dp[j]` and adding `1` or `-1` to the prefix sum.
  - This transition ensures that we explore all possible prefix sums up to `2 * n`.
- **Final Calculation**:
  - After processing all positions, the final prefix sum is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`.
  - The value at `dp[final_sum]` gives the number of ways to achieve the desired prefix sums.

#### Function `func_2`
- **Input Handling**:
  - Reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
  - Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

#### Verification

1. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The logic of updating the DP table correctly explores all possible prefix sums.
   - The final result is computed correctly by checking the value at the final prefix sum position.

2. **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - The function reads input correctly and processes each test case independently.
   - It calls `func_1` with the correct parameters and prints the results.

However, upon closer inspection, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect DP Transition**:
   - The DP table `dp` is updated by considering both `j + 1` and `j - 1`, but this does not accurately reflect the problem constraints. The prefix sums must be adjusted based on the actual values in `p` rather than just adding or subtracting `1`.

2. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final sum `final_sum = p[-1] + offset` does not account for the actual prefix sums in `p`. Instead, it should consider the cumulative effect of the prefix sums in `p`.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation `dp[j + 1] = (dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` and `dp[j - 1] = (dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` should be applied correctly to ensure the result is within the required range.

Given these issues, the original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
