Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for counting the number of initial arrays `a` that result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly handle the logic for generating all possible prefix sums that could result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  -1 0 0
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  0
  ```

However, the program incorrectly outputs `1` for this test case. This is because the `func_1` function does not correctly simulate the generation of all possible prefix sums that could result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. The function seems to be attempting to generate prefix sums using dynamic programming, but it does not correctly account for the constraints and the nature of the prefix sums.

A correct implementation would need to ensure that the generated prefix sums match the properties of the original array `a`, which consists of only `1` and `-1`. The current implementation does not handle these constraints properly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
