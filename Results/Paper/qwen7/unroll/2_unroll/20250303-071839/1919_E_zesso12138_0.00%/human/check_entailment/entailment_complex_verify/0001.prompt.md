You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), and `p`, a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order with each element's absolute value not exceeding `n`. It initializes a list `dp` of length `2 * n + 1` with zeros. The function then iteratively updates `dp` based on its previous values, ensuring that each element in `dp` is updated modulo some `MOD`. After completing these updates, the function calculates `final_sum` as the sum of the last element of `p` and `n`, and returns the value at `dp[final_sum]`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to count the number of possible initial arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1` such that the sorted prefix sums match the given `p`.
   - The function `func_1` should compute the number of such arrays.
   - The function `func_2` reads input and processes multiple test cases using `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function aims to compute the number of ways to construct the array `a` such that the sorted prefix sums match `p`.
   - It uses dynamic programming with a DP table `dp` where `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum `j - n` (offset by `n`).

3. **DP Table Initialization**:
   - `dp` is initialized with `dp[offset] = 1`, meaning one way to have a prefix sum of `0` (since `offset = n`).

4. **DP Transition**:
   - For each position `i` from `1` to `n`, it updates the DP table `new_dp` by considering the previous state `dp[j]` and adding `1` or `-1` to the prefix sum.
   - This transition ensures that we explore all possible prefix sums up to `2 * n`.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - After processing all positions, the final prefix sum is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`.
   - The value at `dp[final_sum]` gives the number of ways to achieve the desired prefix sums.

6. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

### Verification

1. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The logic of updating the DP table correctly explores all possible prefix sums.
   - The final result is computed correctly by checking the value at the final prefix sum position.

2. **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - The function reads input correctly and processes each test case independently.
   - It calls `func_1` with the correct parameters and prints the results.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The dynamic programming approach and the input handling are appropriate and logically sound.
