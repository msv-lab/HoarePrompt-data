You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

    6 2
    
    1 3 4 9 1 3
    
    7 6 8 10 6 8

Output

    1
    1
    0
    7
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: Returns an integer value representing the number of test cases.
   - `func_2()`: Returns a tuple of integers from a line of input.
   - `func_3(primary_items, secondary_heap)`: Computes the total profit based on the items in `primary_items` and the state of `secondary_heap`.
   - `func_4()`: The main function that processes each test case.

2. **Main Function (`func_4()`)**:
   - **Reading Input**: It reads the number of test cases, then iterates over each test case.
   - **Heap Initialization**: Initializes a min-heap (`heap`) and a list (`remaining_items`).
   - **Reading Prices and Bonuses**: Reads the prices and bonuses for each item.
   - **Sorting and Initial Heap Population**: Sorts the items based on their bonuses and pushes the top `k` items into the heap.
   - **Profit Calculation**:
     - If there are more items than `k`, it calculates the profit using `func_3`.
     - It then iteratively processes the remaining items, updating the profit by considering whether to include or exclude items based on their net values (price - bonus).

3. **Profit Calculation Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_3` sums up the bonuses of items in the `secondary_heap` and adds the adjusted values of items in `primary_items`.
   - The main loop in `func_4` ensures that only profitable items (where price - bonus ≥ 0) are considered, and it updates the heap accordingly.

### Verification Against Problem Description

- **Test Case Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
- **Item Selection and Profit Calculation**: The logic for selecting items and calculating profit aligns with the problem description.
- **Optimal Strategy**: The program considers the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob, ensuring that Alice maximizes her profit and Bob minimizes it.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
