You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of items \(n\), the number of operations \(k\), a list of item prices for Alice, and a list of item bonuses for Bob. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible profit by strategically choosing items to buy and sell based on their prices and bonuses. The function returns the highest profit achieved across all test cases.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where Alice buys fewer than `k` items. According to the problem description, if Alice buys fewer than `k` items, Bob can take all of them for free. However, the current implementation always considers taking `k` items for free, regardless of the number of items Alice buys.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
3 1
2 1 3
3 2 1
```

According to the problem description:
- Alice should buy the 3rd item (since it has the highest difference `b_i - a_i`).
- Bob will take the 1st item for free, and Alice will buy the 2nd and 3rd items from the shop.
- Alice's profit should be `3 - 1 = 2`.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the profit as follows:
1. It sorts the items based on `b_i - a_i`: `[(2, 3), (1, 2), (-1, 1)]`.
2. It takes the top `k` items for free: `[(2, 3)]`.
3. It calculates the profit as `3 - 2 = 1`, which is incorrect.

The correct implementation should check if Alice buys fewer than `k` items and handle that case appropriately. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
