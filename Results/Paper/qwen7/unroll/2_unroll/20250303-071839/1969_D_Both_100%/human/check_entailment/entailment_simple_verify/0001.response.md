### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning based on the provided annotated code and the problem description.

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: Correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_2()`: Correctly reads and splits the input into integers.
   - `func_3(primary_items, secondary_heap)`: Computes the total profit based on the items in `primary_items` and the state of `secondary_heap`. This function is logically sound but needs further verification.
   - `func_4()`: The main function that processes each test case. It initializes a min-heap and a list of remaining items, reads the prices and bonuses, sorts the items, and processes them according to the rules.

2. **Main Function (`func_4()`)**:
   - **Reading Input**: Correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - **Heap Initialization**: Initializes a min-heap and a list of remaining items.
   - **Reading Prices and Bonuses**: Correctly reads and processes the prices and bonuses.
   - **Sorting and Initial Heap Population**: Sorts the items based on their bonuses and pushes the top `k` items into the heap.
   - **Profit Calculation**:
     - If there are more items than `k`, it calculates the profit using `func_3`.
     - Iteratively processes the remaining items, updating the profit by considering whether to include or exclude items based on their net values (price - bonus).

3. **Profit Calculation Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_3` sums up the bonuses of items in the `secondary_heap` and adds the adjusted values of items in `primary_items`.
   - The main loop in `func_4` ensures that only profitable items (where price - bonus â‰¥ 0) are considered, and it updates the heap accordingly.

### Detailed Verification

- **Heap Initialization and Item Selection**:
  - The heap is initialized with the top `k` items based on their bonuses. This ensures that the most valuable items are considered first.
  - The remaining items are processed one by one, and the heap is updated to reflect the best possible selection of items.

- **Profit Calculation**:
  - The function `func_3` correctly computes the profit by summing up the bonuses of items in the `secondary_heap` and adjusting the values of items in `primary_items`.
  - The main loop in `func_4` ensures that only profitable items are included in the calculation, and it updates the heap to reflect the best possible selection.

- **Optimal Strategy**:
  - The program considers the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob, ensuring that Alice maximizes her profit and Bob minimizes it.

### Conclusion

After carefully analyzing the program and the annotated code, the logic appears to be correct and aligns with the problem description. The program correctly handles the input, initializes the heap, processes the items, and calculates the profit according to the specified rules.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
