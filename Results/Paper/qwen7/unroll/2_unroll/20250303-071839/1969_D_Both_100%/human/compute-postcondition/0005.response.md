Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `primary_items`, which is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (a_i, b_i), and a parameter `secondary_heap`, which is a list of integers representing the difference (b_i - a_i) for each item. It returns the sum of the first element plus the second element of each tuple in `primary_items` if the sum of the elements in the tuple is greater than or equal to 0.**
