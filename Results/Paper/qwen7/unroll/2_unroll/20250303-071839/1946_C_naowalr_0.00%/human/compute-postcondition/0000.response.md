Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(sys.stdin.readline())` reads an integer from standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `L` and `R` remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4 is preserved, and the values of `L` and `R` are explicitly stated.
