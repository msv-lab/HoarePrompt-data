Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `L` is 1, `R` is 1.

Explanation: The loop iterates `t` times, and in each iteration, it performs a binary search to find the maximum value `x` such that the number of cuts required to divide the tree into components where no component has more than `x` nodes is less than or equal to `k`. After each iteration, the value of `L` is updated based on the result of the binary search. Since the binary search converges to a specific value within the range `[L, R]`, and `R` is initially set to `int(100000.0 + 1)` which is 100001, the final value of `L` will be the largest value that satisfies the condition. However, since the loop ends when `R - L` is no longer greater than 1, the final value of `L` will be 1, and `R` will also be 1.
