You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the specific values of `loop` and the inputs provided within each iteration of the loop. After executing all iterations, `loop` integers will be processed, and for each integer, a value of `num` will be calculated based on the elements in `big`, `less`, and `no`. The final output will be a series of values printed for each iteration, with each value representing `num` for that particular iteration. Each `num` is calculated as the difference between the minimum of `less` and the maximum of `big`, adjusted by the number of elements in `no` that fall within the range defined by `min(less)` and `max(big)`, ensuring this difference is at least 1. If the difference is less than 1, the output is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of constraints involving integers \( t \) and \( n \). For each of the \( n \) lines, it reads two integers \( a \) and \( x \), categorizing them into three lists based on the value of \( a \): `big`, `less`, and `no`. It then calculates the difference between the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`, adjusting this difference by subtracting the count of elements in `no` that fall within the range defined by `min(less)` and `max(big)`. If this difference is less than 1, the output is 0; otherwise, the adjusted difference is printed. This process is repeated for each of the \( t \) test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there is a constraint of type 3 (k must not be equal to some integer x) that falls within the range defined by the constraints of type 1 and 2. Specifically, the program calculates the range between the minimum value of `less` and the maximum value of `big` and subtracts the number of elements in `no` that fall within this range. However, it does not account for the fact that if an element in `no` is exactly equal to the minimum value of `less` or the maximum value of `big`, it should not be counted as it would violate the constraints.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
3 10
1 3
2 15
3 11
```
Here, the constraints are:
- \( k \geq 3 \)
- \( k \leq 15 \)
- \( k \neq 11 \)

The program will calculate the range from 3 to 15, which is 13 possible values. However, since 11 is not allowed, the correct answer should be 12, but the program incorrectly counts 11 as part of the valid range, resulting in 13 - 1 = 12 instead of 12 - 1 = 11.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the elements in `no` are exactly equal to the minimum value of `less` or the maximum value of `big` and exclude them accordingly.
