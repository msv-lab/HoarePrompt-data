Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `for` loop to iterate over the range of values generated by `range(int(input()))`.
   
2. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are more values to iterate over from the range generated by `int(input())`.
   - Since `_` is just a placeholder, the actual state adjustments should focus on ensuring that `int(input())` provides valid input for the loop to continue.

3. **Initial State Provided**:
   - `t` (the number of test cases) is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - For each test case, `n` (the size of the permutation) is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
   - The permutation \(p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}\) is a permutation of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\).

4. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer. This means the user must provide a valid integer input for the loop to proceed.

Given these points, the state that needs adjustment is the input value that will be read by `int(input())`. The loop will continue as long as this input is a positive integer within the specified range for `t`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that will be read by `int(input())` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`int(input())` must return a positive integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive**.
