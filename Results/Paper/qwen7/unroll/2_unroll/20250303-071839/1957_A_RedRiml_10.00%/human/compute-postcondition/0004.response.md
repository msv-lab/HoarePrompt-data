Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers representing stick lengths. It returns a value based on the conditions given for the test cases, where each test case includes an integer t (number of test cases), another integer n (number of sticks), and a list of n integers (lengths of the sticks).**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a specific number of sticks with given lengths. The function does not take any direct parameters but uses the structure of the input data to determine its output.
