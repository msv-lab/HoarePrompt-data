Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 represents the lengths of the sticks.
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an integer representing the number of iterations of the loop, `shapes` is an integer representing the total number of unique integers in the input lists that appear at least three times across all iterations.
    #
    #The loop processes `w` inputs. For each input, it reads an integer `ln` and a list of integers `palka`. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `palka`, keeping track of unique integers that appear at least three times. The final count of such integers is printed for each input, and `shapes` accumulates these counts across all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer indicating the number of sticks and a list of stick lengths. It counts the number of unique stick lengths that appear at least three times across all test cases and prints this count for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the count of such unique stick lengths for each test case.
