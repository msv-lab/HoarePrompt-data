Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list of integers k_i (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) for each outcome i. For each test case, it returns a result based on the given inputs.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing specific parameters t, n, and a list of k_i values. The exact nature of the return value isn't specified here, but it implies that the function will produce some output based on these inputs.
