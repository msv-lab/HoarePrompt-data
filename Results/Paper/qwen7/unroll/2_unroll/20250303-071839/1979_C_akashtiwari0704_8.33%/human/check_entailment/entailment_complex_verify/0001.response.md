### Reasoning:

The original assessment provided a detailed step-by-step analysis of the program and concluded that the program is correct. However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the problem statement, we need to verify if the program indeed meets the requirements.

#### Key Points to Verify:

1. **Product Calculation:**
   - The product `prod` is correctly calculated as the multiplication of all multipliers.

2. **Bet Calculation:**
   - The bet calculation `a[i] = prod // a[i]` ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the reward is `a[i] * a[i]`, which is `prod`.
   - This setup ensures that the total bet is less than the reward for any winning outcome.

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum `sumo` is correctly calculated as the sum of all individual bets.

4. **Feasibility Check:**
   - The check `if sumo >= prod:` is correct. If the sum of bets is greater than or equal to the product, it means the conditions cannot be met, and thus `-1` is printed.

5. **Output Construction:**
   - The construction of the answer string `ans` is correct, and it prints the bets separated by spaces.

Upon re-evaluation, the program does indeed meet all the requirements specified in the problem statement. The logic for calculating the bets and checking the feasibility is sound. The program correctly handles the constraints and produces the expected output.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem statement.

**Final: True**
