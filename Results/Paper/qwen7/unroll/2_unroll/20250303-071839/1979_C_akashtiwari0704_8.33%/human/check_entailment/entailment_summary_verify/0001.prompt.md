You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    -1

Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        prod = 1
        for i in range(bets):
            prod *= a[i]
        sumo = 0
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t`, followed by `t` lines of input, each containing an integer `bets`. It then reads `bets` integers into a list `a`. The function calculates the product of all integers in `a` and divides each element in `a` by this product, summing these divisions. If the sum is greater than or equal to the product, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the modified list `a` as space-separated integers. This process is repeated for each test case, producing a series of outputs corresponding to each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a`.

2. **Calculating Total Multiplier Product:**
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).
   - This is done using a loop that multiplies each element in the list `a`.

3. **Calculating Individual Bets:**
   - For each outcome, the program calculates the bet required to ensure that the total bet is less than the reward.
   - Specifically, it sets `a[i]` to `prod // a[i]`, which means the bet for the i-th outcome is the product of all multipliers divided by the i-th multiplier.
   - It then adds up these individual bets to get `sumo`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - If the total bet `sumo` is greater than or equal to the product `prod`, the program prints `-1` indicating no feasible distribution.
   - Otherwise, it constructs and prints the list of bets.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Product Calculation:**
   - The product `prod` is correctly calculated as the multiplication of all multipliers.

2. **Bet Calculation:**
   - The bet calculation `a[i] = prod // a[i]` ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the reward is `a[i] * a[i]`, which is `prod`.
   - This setup ensures that the total bet is less than the reward for any winning outcome.

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum `sumo` is correctly calculated as the sum of all individual bets.

4. **Feasibility Check:**
   - The check `if sumo >= prod:` is correct. If the sum of bets is greater than or equal to the product, it means the conditions cannot be met, and thus `-1` is printed.

5. **Output Construction:**
   - The construction of the answer string `ans` is correct, and it prints the bets separated by spaces.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem statement.
