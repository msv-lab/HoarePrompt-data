Reasoning:

1. The problem requires distributing coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
2. The annotated program attempts to solve this by calculating the product of all multipliers (`prod`) and then dividing this product by each multiplier to get the required bet amounts. It then checks if the sum of these bet amounts is less than the product. If it is, it prints the bet amounts; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

However, there are several issues with the logic in the annotated program:

- The program calculates `prod` as the product of all multipliers, which means `prod` is the product of all `k_i`. This approach doesn't necessarily ensure that the total bet is less than the amount received for any single outcome.
- The program divides `prod` by each `k_i` to get the bet amounts, but this does not guarantee that the sum of these bets will be less than `prod`.
- The program does not consider the possibility of distributing the bets in a way that ensures the condition is met for each outcome individually.

Given these issues, the annotated program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
