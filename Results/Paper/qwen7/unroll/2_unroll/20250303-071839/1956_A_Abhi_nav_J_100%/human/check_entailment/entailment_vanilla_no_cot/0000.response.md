Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not designed to handle the logic of the game as described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**: 
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` simply returns `a - 1` if `a <= b`, otherwise it returns `b`. This does not reflect the logic of kicking out players based on the sequence `a`.

2. **Logic for Kicking Out Players**:
   - The logic needs to keep track of the remaining players and check if the current position in the sequence `a` can be applied to the remaining players.
   - The function should simulate the rounds of the game and count how many players remain until no more players can be kicked out.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Player Removal**:
   - The program does not simulate the rounds of the game properly. It should iterate through the sequence `a` and remove players from the list until no more players can be removed in a round.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to simulate the rounds of the game and keep track of the remaining players. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    og = input().split()
    k = int(og[0])
    q = int(og[1])
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    results = []
    
    for ni in map(int, input().split()):
        players = [i for i in range(1, ni + 1)]
        while True:
            removed = False
            for pos in a:
                if pos <= len(players):
                    players.pop(pos - 1)
                    removed = True
            if not removed:
                break
        results.append(len(players))
    
    print(' '.join(map(str, results)))
```

This program correctly simulates the rounds of the game and counts the number of remaining players for each initial number of players `n_i`.
