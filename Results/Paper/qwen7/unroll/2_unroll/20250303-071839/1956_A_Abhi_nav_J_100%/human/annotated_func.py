#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 and a is sorted in strictly increasing order, b is a list of q integers where 1 ≤ q ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ b[i] ≤ 100 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ q.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #The program returns a list that is each element of the original list 'a' decremented by 1.
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns the list 'b' which contains q integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, and the list 'a' (which is sorted in strictly increasing order) is not less than or equal to list 'b'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two lists, `a` and `b`. List `a` contains `k` integers sorted in strictly increasing order, and list `b` contains `q` integers, each between 1 and 100 inclusive. If every element in `a` is greater than or equal to every element in `b`, the function returns list `b`. Otherwise, it returns a new list where each element of `a` is decremented by 1.
