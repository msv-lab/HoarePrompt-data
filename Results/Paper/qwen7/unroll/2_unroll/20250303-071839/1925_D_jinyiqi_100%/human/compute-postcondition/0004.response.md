Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers, each representing the result of the expression `(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)` for each iteration of the loop. These results are calculated based on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `sum_f` for each test case provided by the input. Each test case will produce one output value, and the final output state will be a list of these values.
