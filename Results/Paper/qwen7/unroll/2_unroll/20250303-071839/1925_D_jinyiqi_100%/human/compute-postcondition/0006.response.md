Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes integers t, n, m, and k, along with m lines of additional data. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the given constraints and input data. Specifically, it computes an expression involving `p`, `q`, and `M`, and outputs the result modulo `M`. The final output consists of a series of integers, one for each test case.**
