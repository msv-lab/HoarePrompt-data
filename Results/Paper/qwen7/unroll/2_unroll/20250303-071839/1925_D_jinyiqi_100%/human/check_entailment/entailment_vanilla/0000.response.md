Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Calculating Combinations:**
   - It calculates the total number of unique pairs of children (`cn2`), which is \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

3. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - It iterates through each of the `m` pairs of friends and sums up their friendship values (`sum_f`).

4. **Calculating Expected Value:**
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{Expected value} = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2}
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the problem statement, but let's verify if it matches the expected result.

5. **Simplifying the Formula:**
   - Simplify the numerator:
     \[
     2 \cdot k \cdot \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) = k \cdot n(n-1) \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
   - Simplify the denominator:
     \[
     2 \cdot \left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \cdot n(n-1) = \frac{n^2(n-1)^2}{4}
     \]

6. **GCD and Simplification:**
   - The program uses `math.gcd` to simplify the fraction.
   - Finally, it computes the modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and multiplies it with `p`.

### Verification:

Let's verify the correctness of the formula and the steps:

- The formula used in the program seems to be correct based on the problem description.
- The simplification steps are also correct.
- The use of `math.gcd` ensures that the fraction is in its simplest form.
- The modular inverse calculation is necessary because we need the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct in terms of both logic and implementation.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
