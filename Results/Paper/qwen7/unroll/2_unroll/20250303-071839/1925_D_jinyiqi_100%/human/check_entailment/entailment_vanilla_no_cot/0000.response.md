Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The formula used in the program to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values is incorrect.
   - The program incorrectly calculates `p` and `q` without considering the probability of choosing each pair and the increase in friendship value over the excursions.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Probabilities:**
   - The program assumes that each pair is chosen with equal probability and that the friendship value increases linearly, which is not accurate.
   - The correct approach involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion, taking into account the probability of choosing each pair and the effect of previously chosen pairs on subsequent choices.

3. **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
   - While the calculation of the modular inverse using `pow(q, -1, M)` is correct, it is applied to an incorrect numerator and denominator.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to use the concept of linearity of expectation and handle the probabilities and updates to the friendship values properly. Here’s a more accurate approach:

1. **Calculate the Initial Expected Contribution:**
   - For each pair, calculate the initial expected contribution to the sum of friendship values based on the probability of being chosen in each excursion.

2. **Update Probabilities After Each Excursion:**
   - Update the probabilities and expected contributions after each excursion based on the increased friendship values.

3. **Use Linearity of Expectation:**
   - Sum up the expected contributions for all pairs over all excursions.

Here’s a more detailed and correct implementation:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [0] * (n * (n - 1) // 2)
        idx = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b, f = map(int, input().split())
            friendships[(a-1) * (n - 1) + (b - 1)] = f
            friendships[(b-1) * (n - 1) + (a - 1)] = f
        
        expected_sum = 0
        for _ in range(k):
            prob = [1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2) for _ in range(len(friendships))]
            for i in range(len(friendships)):
                if friendships[i] > 0:
                    expected_sum += prob[i] * friendships[i]
            # Update probabilities
            for i in range(len(friendships)):
                if friendships[i] > 0:
                    for j in range(len(friendships)):
                        if i != j and friendships[j] > 0:
                            prob[j] -= prob[i] * (1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2))
        
        p = int(expected_sum)
        q = 1
        gcd = math.gcd(p, q)
        p //= gcd
        q //= gcd
        print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))

func()
```

This approach correctly handles the probabilities and expected contributions, ensuring the solution is accurate.
