Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes integers t, n, m, and k, along with m lines of additional data. It returns information based on the given constraints and input data for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific integers and additional data points, without accepting any parameters directly. The function processes these inputs according to the specified constraints and returns relevant information for each test case.
