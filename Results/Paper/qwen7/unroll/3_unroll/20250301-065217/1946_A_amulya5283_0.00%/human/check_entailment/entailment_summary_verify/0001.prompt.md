You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers.

The median of an array q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_k is the number p_{\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil} , where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order.
For example, the median of the array [9, 5, 1, 2, 6] is 5 , as in the sorted
array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 is 5
, and the median of the array [9, 2, 8, 3] is 3 , as in the sorted array [2,
3, 8, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 is 3 .

You are allowed to choose an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) and increase a_i by 1
in one operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the
median of the array.

Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations
required to increase the median of the array.

Note

In the first test case, you can apply one operation to the first number and
obtain the array [3, 2, 8] , the median of this array is 3 , as it is the
number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 3, 8] . The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2 , as it is
the number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 2, 8] . Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in just one operation.

In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 2, 3 and obtain the array [6, 6, 6, 4, 5] , the median of this
array is 6 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 6, 6, 6] . The median of the original array
[5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil
= 2 in the non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] . Thus, the median
increased (6 > 5 ) in three operations. It can be shown that this is the
minimum possible number of operations.

In the fifth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 3 and obtain the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4] , the median of this
array is 3 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4] . The median of the original
array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2 , as it is the number at index \lceil
\frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] .
Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in two operations. It can be shown that
this is the minimum possible number of operations.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and an array of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of operations required to ensure that the smallest element in a min-heap (initialized with the second half of the sorted array) is greater than the median value of the original array. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of operations performed for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into tokens. This part is handled well and ensures that the input is parsed correctly.

2. **Test Cases Handling**: The program iterates through the test cases and extracts the necessary information (length of the array and the array itself). This is done correctly, and the test cases are stored in a list of tuples.

3. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to process each test case. This function takes the number of test cases and the list of test cases as arguments.

4. **Sorting and Median Calculation**: For each test case, the array is sorted, and the median index is calculated correctly. However, the calculation of the median index should account for both even and odd lengths of the array. Specifically, for an even-length array, the median is the average of the two middle elements, but since we need the element at the higher index, we use `n // 2` for the index.

5. **Heap Usage**: The program uses a min-heap to find the minimum number of operations required to make the median larger. This approach is sound because it ensures that we increment the smallest elements until the median is increased. However, there's a flaw in the logic:
   - The program initializes the heap with elements from the middle of the sorted array, which is unnecessary. Instead, it should focus on the elements that could potentially affect the median.
   - The loop continues to increment the smallest element in the heap until it exceeds the current median. This is a good approach, but the initial setup of the heap might include elements that do not contribute to the median directly.

6. **Operations Counting**: The program increments the count of operations each time it pops the smallest element from the heap and pushes back the incremented value. This is correct as long as the heap only contains elements that could affect the median.

Given these points, the program has a logical flaw in how the heap is initialized and used. It unnecessarily includes elements that do not contribute to the median calculation, which might lead to incorrect results in some cases.
