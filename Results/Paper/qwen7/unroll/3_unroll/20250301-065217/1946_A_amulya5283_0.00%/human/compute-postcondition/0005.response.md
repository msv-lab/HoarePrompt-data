Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (the length of the array `a`) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (the array `a`). After processing each test case, the function returns a list of integers called 'results', where each integer represents the number of operations performed for each test case.**
