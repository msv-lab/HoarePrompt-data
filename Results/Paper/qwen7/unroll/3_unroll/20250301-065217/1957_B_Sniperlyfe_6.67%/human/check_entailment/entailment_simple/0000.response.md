Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then sets each element of `nums` to the largest possible value that can be represented with the bit length of `k`. This value is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with the bit length of `k`.
   - After setting each element, it subtracts this value from `k`.
   - Finally, it adjusts the last element of `nums` to ensure the total sum is `k`.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The loop continues until `k` becomes zero or negative, ensuring that the sum of the elements in `nums` equals `k`.
   - The last element adjustment ensures that the sum is exactly `k` even if `k` is smaller than the maximum value that could be set for each element.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results in the required format, ensuring that each test case's solution is separated by a newline.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that each element in `nums` is maximally set to the largest possible value for its bit length, and the last element is adjusted to meet the exact sum requirement.
   - The bitwise OR operation of such numbers will have the maximum number of 1s possible given the constraints.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
