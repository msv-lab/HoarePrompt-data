Postcondition: **`sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`. `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n+1` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The length of `sb` is now equal to or greater than the length of `sa`. `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `xx` remains an unchanged list of `n` input strings. For each `i` in the range 1 to `n`, `nx[i-1]` is constructed based on the following rules: if `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, `nx[i-1]` is built by appending characters from `xx[i]` or appending 'F' or 'S' based on whether `i` or `j` (for all `j` from 1 to `n`) is in the first quarter of `sa`. If `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', it appends that character. Otherwise, it appends 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, and 'S' otherwise. If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, `nx[i-1]` is constructed based on the same rules as described above.**
