State: **`t` is the length of `sa`, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n+1` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 1 in the range function `range(1, n + 1)`.
2. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
3. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (otherwise, the range would be empty).
4. The initial value of `i` is set to 1 within the loop itself, so no adjustment is needed for `i` other than ensuring it starts at 1.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` (must be at least 1) and the initial value of `i` (which is already set to 1).
