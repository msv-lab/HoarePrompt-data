Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a valid transition video plan for all inputs. Specifically, the program does not ensure that for any permutation of the scenarios, the transition videos do not have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) videos of the same type consecutively. 

Consider the following input:
```
5
.F?S?
.?F?.
S?.?F
?F?.S
?.S?.
```

The program's output for this input is:
```
.FFFFF
.FFFFF
SFFFFF
FFFFSF
FFFFS.
```

However, for the permutation of scenarios \(1, 3, 5, 2, 4\), the sequence of transition videos would be `FSSF`, which has 3 consecutive scary videos (`SSF`), violating the requirement of having no more than \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 5}{4} \rceil = 4\) videos of the same type consecutively.

Thus, the program fails to meet the problem requirements for this input, making it incorrect.
