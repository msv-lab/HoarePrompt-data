### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to fill in the undecided transition videos (`?`) in a way that no matter the order of scenarios, no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type (`F` or `S`) appear.
   - The input guarantees that at most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) transitions are already decided.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads the input and processes it to count the number of `F` and `S` transitions for each scenario.
   - It then categorizes scenarios into two lists: `sa` for those with more `F` transitions and `sb` for those with more `S` transitions.
   - If `sa` is longer than or equal to `sb`, it fills in the undecided transitions (`?`) by favoring `F` for scenarios in the first \(\frac{n}{4}\) positions of `sa`.
   - Otherwise, it favors `S` for scenarios in the first \(\frac{n}{4}\) positions of `sb`.

3. **Issues with the Code:**
   - The code incorrectly categorizes scenarios into `sa` and `sb` based on the number of `F` and `S` transitions. This is flawed because it should consider the balance of `F` and `S` transitions across all pairs, not just individual scenarios.
   - The logic for filling in the undecided transitions (`?`) is overly simplistic and does not ensure the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive `F` or `S` transitions is met for any permutation of scenarios.
   - The code does not account for the fact that the distribution of `F` and `S` transitions needs to be balanced across all pairs, not just individual scenarios.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To ensure the constraint is met, we need to balance the number of `F` and `S` transitions across all pairs. One effective strategy is to use a greedy algorithm that ensures the maximum number of consecutive `F` or `S` transitions does not exceed \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\).
   - The provided code does not implement this balancing strategy correctly. Instead, it makes a simple decision based on the number of `F` and `S` transitions for each scenario, which is insufficient to meet the problem's requirements.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The given implementation does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It fails to ensure the required constraint is met for all possible permutations of scenarios.
