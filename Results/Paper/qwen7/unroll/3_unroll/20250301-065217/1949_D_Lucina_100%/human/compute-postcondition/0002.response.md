Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1`, all elements of which are 0; `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, all elements of which are 0.**

The code initializes a new list `b` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The original list `a` remains unchanged, still having `n + 1` elements, all set to 0.
