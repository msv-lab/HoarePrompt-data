Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations, where each operation can either permute the rows or columns.
2. **Analysis of the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - It calculates the sum of the matrix and the value `r` based on the condition involving triangular numbers.
   - It prints the calculated sum and the value `n + r`.
   - It then prints the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
     - For the first `n` lines, it performs row permutations setting each row to the sequence from 1 to `n`.
     - For the next `r` lines, it performs column permutations setting each column to the sequence from 1 to `n` in a cyclic manner.

3. **Verification**:
   - The sum calculation logic seems correct. The sum is calculated based on the triangular number formula and the remaining elements.
   - The operations performed ensure that each row and column is set to a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, which is necessary to maximize the sum.
   - The number of operations is exactly `n + r`, which is within the limit of `2n`.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
