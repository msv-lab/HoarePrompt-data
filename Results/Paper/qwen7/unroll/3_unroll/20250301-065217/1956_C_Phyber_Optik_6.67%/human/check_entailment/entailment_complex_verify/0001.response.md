### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `sum` and `r` to 0.
   - It iterates through values from 1 to `n` and calculates `sum` based on the condition:
     - If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, it sets `r = i` and adds `n * (n + 1) // 2` to `sum`.
     - Otherwise, it adds `i * n` to `sum`.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The program prints the calculated `sum` and `n + r`.
   - It then performs the required operations:
     - For the first `n` operations (if `j <= n`), it prints a Type 1 operation setting the entire first row to `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
     - For the remaining operations (if `j > n`), it prints a Type 2 operation setting the entire first column to `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating `sum` is incorrect. The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix elements, not to calculate a sum based on some arbitrary condition.
   - The current logic does not align with the problem statement. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the matrix elements by strategically placing permutations in rows and columns.

2. **Operations:**
   - The program prints `n + r` operations, where `r` is determined in the loop. However, the operations do not seem to follow the rules specified in the problem:
     - Type 1 operations should permute entire rows.
     - Type 2 operations should permute entire columns.
   - The current implementation does not correctly reflect these operations. Instead, it sets the first row and column to `[1, 2, ..., n]` repeatedly, which does not maximize the sum.

### Correct Solution Approach:

To maximize the sum of the matrix, we need to strategically place permutations in rows and columns. Hereâ€™s a correct approach:

1. **Type 1 Operations:**
   - Perform `n` Type 1 operations to set each row to a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - This ensures that each element in the matrix is part of a permutation, contributing to the maximum possible sum.

2. **Type 2 Operations:**
   - Perform `n` Type 2 operations to set each column to a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - This ensures that each element in the matrix is part of a permutation, contributing to the maximum possible sum.

### Correct Implementation:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
        print(sum, 2 * n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Final Evaluation:

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It does not follow the rules for performing Type 1 and Type 2 operations and does not maximize the sum of the matrix elements as required.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
