Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). Additionally, the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. For each test case, the function determines whether the conditions for `t` and `n` are met and returns a result based on these conditions.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing integers `t` and `n` within specified ranges, and ensures the cumulative condition on `n^2` is satisfied across all cases. The exact return value or further processing steps are not detailed here but are implied to be based on the given constraints.
