Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the matrix. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the sum directly without performing the necessary operations to achieve the maximum sum.

The program calculates the sum using a formula that does not account for the operations needed to set the matrix elements to their optimal values. It also does not handle the operations to set rows and columns to permutations as described in the problem statement.

For example, consider a 2x2 matrix. The correct approach would involve setting the first row to [1, 2] and the first column to [1, 2], resulting in a matrix with elements [[1, 2], [2, 4]], which sums to 7. However, the provided program does not perform these operations and instead calculates a sum that does not reflect the actual matrix configuration after the operations.

Here's a specific case where the program fails:
- Input: `2`
- Expected Output: 
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```
- Actual Output: The program does not produce the correct sequence of operations and the sum is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
