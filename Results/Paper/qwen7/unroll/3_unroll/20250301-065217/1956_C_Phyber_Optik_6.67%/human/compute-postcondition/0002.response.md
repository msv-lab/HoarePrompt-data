Output State: The output will consist of `t` pairs of lines, each pair containing a sum and a number `n + r`. For each iteration:

1. A sum (`sum`) is calculated based on the value of `n`.
2. A number `r` is determined within the inner loop.
3. The sum and `n + r` are printed.
4. Two blocks of output follow:
   - The first block prints `n` lines with the first element being 1 and the second element being the current line number `j`, followed by a sequence from 1 to `n`.
   - The second block prints `n + r` lines where the first element alternates between 2 and the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, and the second element is the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, followed by a sequence from 1 to `n`.

This process repeats `t` times, with `t` being the input integer provided at the start.
