You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function processes a specified number of test cases (determined by the input `t`). For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of applications with 1 × 1 icons and 2 × 2 icons, respectively. After processing all test cases, it does not produce any output or return a value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` is flawed. Let's analyze the issue:

1. The formula `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` calculates the number of full 2x2 grids needed for `y` icons.
2. The next line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` attempts to adjust `x` based on the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. However, this adjustment is incorrect because it adds back the space taken by 2x2 icons instead of subtracting the space they occupy.
3. The calculation `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is intended to calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons, but it is based on an incorrect adjustment of `x`.

To illustrate the error, consider the following test case:
- Input: `12 4`
- Expected output: `2`

However, the program will incorrectly calculate the number of screens needed. For instance, if we try to place 12 1x1 icons and 4 2x2 icons, the program might incorrectly calculate the number of screens needed due to the flawed logic in adjusting `x`.

A correct approach would involve calculating the total space required for both types of icons and then determining the minimum number of screens needed to fit them. This requires a more detailed and accurate calculation of the space occupied by each type of icon and how they can be optimally placed across the screens.
