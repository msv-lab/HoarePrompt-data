To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the expressions involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `bxsfory` is equal to the ceiling of `y` divided by 2.
   - `bxsfory1` is 1 if `x` is greater than 0, otherwise 0.
   - `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **`bxsfory`**: This is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2. The ceiling function rounds up to the nearest integer. So, if `y` is 3.7, `bxsfory` would be 4. If `y` is 4, `bxsfory` would also be 4.

- **`bxsfory1`**: This is 1 if `x` is greater than 0, otherwise 0. The value of `x` is not explicitly given, but it will be used in the calculation of `x` after updating.

- **`x` Update**: The value of `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This means the new value of `x` depends on the current value of `x`, `bxsfory`, and `y`.

### Calculation of `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`:

- Since `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2, it is an integer.
- `bxsfory1` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `x`.

Therefore, `bxsfory1 + bxsfory` will be the sum of an integer (the ceiling of `y` divided by 2) and either 0 or 1.

### Final Output:

Output: **integer (the ceiling of y divided by 2) + 0 or 1**
