Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now set to the input integer from the user.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`, the new value of `t` will still satisfy this condition. The other information about `n` and the subsequent integers on the second line of each test case remains unchanged and is not affected by this code snippet.
