Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program instead calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not the same as the maximum possible beauty.

To achieve the maximum beauty, we need to sort the array and then calculate the sum of differences between consecutive elements. The given program does not sort the array, so it cannot guarantee the maximum beauty.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
3 4 3 3
```
The expected output should be `1` because we can rearrange the array to `[3, 3, 3, 4]`, and the beauty would be `(3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 1`.

However, the provided program would output `0` because it simply finds the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array without sorting it. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
