Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now set to the value it was initially. The variable `l` is an integer, which changes with each iteration but is reset to the value of `l` for each new input. The variable `nums` is a list of integers, which changes with each iteration but is reset to the new list of integers for each new input. The variables `x` and `y` are integers that are updated during the inner loop for each input list but are reset to their initial values (0 for `x` and 100000000 for `y`) for each new input. After all iterations, the final value of `x - y` is printed, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the last input list.
