State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and `e` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for e in range(t):` will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer.
2. The variable `e` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0 because `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`.
4. The initial value of `e` is 0, as specified by the loop initialization.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is greater than 0 and `e` is 0.
