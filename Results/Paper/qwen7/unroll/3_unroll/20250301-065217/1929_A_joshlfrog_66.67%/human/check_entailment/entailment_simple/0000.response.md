Reasoning:
The provided function aims to find the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The function attempts to achieve this by finding the maximum and minimum values in the array and calculating their difference. However, this approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array.

To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array in either ascending or descending order. This ensures that the largest differences between consecutive elements are utilized. The function should calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array.

The current implementation only finds the maximum and minimum values and prints their difference, which is not the correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array.

Correctness: **False**

The correct solution would involve sorting the array and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Here is how the corrected function might look:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = sorted([int(x) for x in input().split()])
        
        beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, l):
            beauty += abs(nums[i] - nums[i-1])
        
        print(beauty)
```

This corrected function sorts the array and calculates the beauty correctly by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
