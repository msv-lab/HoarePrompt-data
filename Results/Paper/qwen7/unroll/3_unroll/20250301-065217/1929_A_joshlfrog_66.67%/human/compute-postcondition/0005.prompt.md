You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        x = 0
        
        y = 100000000
        
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        
        print(x - y)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now set to the value it was initially. The variable `l` is an integer, which changes with each iteration but is reset to the value of `l` for each new input. The variable `nums` is a list of integers, which changes with each iteration but is reset to the new list of integers for each new input. The variables `x` and `y` are integers that are updated during the inner loop for each input list but are reset to their initial values (0 for `x` and 100000000 for `y`) for each new input. After all iterations, the final value of `x - y` is printed, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the last input list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) indicating the number of sub-cases, followed by t pairs of integers. For each pair, the first integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) represents the number of integers in the second line, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function processes each sub-case and returns a result for each, but the specific results are not detailed here.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
