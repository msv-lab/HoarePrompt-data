Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not match the problem description and the expected behavior. Specifically, the program is designed to handle multiple test cases but only calls `func_1()` once, which means it will only process one test case at a time.
2. The program should loop over all test cases, but it currently only processes one test case and then exits.
3. The final print statement shows an output of `9`, which is not aligned with any of the example outputs provided in the problem statement.

Given these points, the program is not correctly handling multiple test cases and produces an incorrect output.

Correctness: **False**
