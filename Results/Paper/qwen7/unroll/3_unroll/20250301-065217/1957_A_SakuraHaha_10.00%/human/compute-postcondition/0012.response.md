Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). It counts the occurrences of each integer in the list and calculates the sum of these counts divided by 4. Finally, it prints the result of this calculation for each test case.**
