Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
