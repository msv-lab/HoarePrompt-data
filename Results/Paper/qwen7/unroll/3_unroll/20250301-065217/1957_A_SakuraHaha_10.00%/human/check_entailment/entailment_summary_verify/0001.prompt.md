You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). It counts the occurrences of each integer in the list and calculates the sum of these counts divided by 4. Finally, it prints the result of this calculation for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks `a`.
3. **Counting Stick Lengths**: It uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
4. **Calculating Polygons**: For each unique stick length, it calculates how many complete polygons (with at least 3 sides) can be formed by dividing the count of that length by 3 (since a polygon must have at least 3 sides). However, this logic should actually check for the minimum number of sides required for a polygon, which is 3, and ensure that the count is divisible by 3.
5. **Output**: It prints the total number of polygons that can be formed for each test case.

### Analysis:

- The program correctly counts the occurrences of each stick length using a dictionary.
- The program correctly calculates the number of polygons that can be formed by dividing the count of each stick length by 3 (since a polygon must have at least 3 sides).
- However, the program does not handle the case where the count of a stick length is less than 3, which means no polygon can be formed from that length.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1**: `1 1`
  - Stick lengths: `[1]`
  - Count: `{1: 1}`
  - Polygons: `1 // 3 = 0` (correctly outputs 0)
- **Test Case 2**: `2 2 3 3 3 3`
  - Stick lengths: `[2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]`
  - Count: `{2: 2, 3: 4}`
  - Polygons: `2 // 3 = 0` (correctly outputs 0), `4 // 3 = 1` (correctly outputs 1)
- **Test Case 3**: `4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4`
  - Stick lengths: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 4]`
  - Count: `{2: 5, 4: 3}`
  - Polygons: `5 // 3 = 1`, `3 // 3 = 1` (correctly outputs 2)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the logic for counting and forming polygons, but it does not explicitly check if the count of a stick length is less than 3 before attempting to divide by 3. However, since the problem constraints ensure that the input will always be valid (each stick length is at least 1 and the number of sticks is at most 100), the current implementation is sufficient.
