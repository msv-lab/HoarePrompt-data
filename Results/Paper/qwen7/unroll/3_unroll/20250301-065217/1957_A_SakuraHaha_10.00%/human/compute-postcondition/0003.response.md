Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = dict()` creates an empty dictionary named `cnt`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
