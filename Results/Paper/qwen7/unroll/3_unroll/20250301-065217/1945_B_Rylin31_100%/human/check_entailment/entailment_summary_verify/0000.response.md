### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the problem statement carefully.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- We need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible in the sky at the same time.
- Each firework is visible for \(m + 1\) minutes after its launch.
- Both installations launch fireworks at intervals of \(a\) and \(b\) minutes respectively.
- The key point is to determine how many fireworks from both installations can be visible at the same time.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes a series of test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates \(m // a + m // b + 2\) and prints the result.

#### Analysis:
1. **Calculation of Visible Fireworks**:
   - \(m // a\) gives the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period.
   - \(m // b\) gives the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period.
   - Adding 2 accounts for the initial fireworks launched at time 0 by both installations.

2. **Overlap Consideration**:
   - The key issue is whether these calculations correctly account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations.
   - The formula \(m // a + m // b + 2\) does not inherently account for the exact overlap condition as mentioned in the original assessment.

3. **Example Verification**:
   - For the example input \((a=6, b=7, m=4)\):
     - Fireworks from the first installation are launched at times \([6, 12, 18, 24]\).
     - Fireworks from the second installation are launched at times \([7, 14, 21, 28]\).
     - Within the visibility period of 4 minutes, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is indeed 2 (one from each installation).
     - The program correctly outputs `2`.

4. **General Case**:
   - The formula \(m // a + m // b + 2\) works because it correctly counts the initial fireworks and the fireworks that fall within the visibility period without double-counting the overlap.
   - The overlap is inherently accounted for by the division operations, as any overlap would reduce the count by 1 in both \(m // a\) and \(m // b\).

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, even though it does not explicitly handle the LCM.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct as it accurately calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time using the given formula.
