Output State: **`empty` is True, `t` is the integer input value, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`, and `n` is the integer input value; `edges` is an empty list.**

The variable `empty` is set to `True`, indicating that initially, no edges have been added to the list. The values of `t`, `u`, `v`, `n`, and `edges` remain unchanged from their initial states.
