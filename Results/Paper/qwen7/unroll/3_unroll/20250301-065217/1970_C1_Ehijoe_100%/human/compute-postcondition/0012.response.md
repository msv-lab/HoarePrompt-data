Output State: **`empty` is False, `t` is the integer input value, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `n` is the integer input value, `edges` is a list of edges entered during the loop, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key from 1 to `n` has a list of its adjacent nodes, `ends` is a list containing all keys from 1 to `n` that have exactly one adjacent node, `s` is an integer from the list `ends`, `e` is an integer from the list `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the integer `s`.**

Explanation: The line `tree = [s]` creates a new list called `tree` and initializes it with the value of `s`, which is an integer from the list `ends`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
