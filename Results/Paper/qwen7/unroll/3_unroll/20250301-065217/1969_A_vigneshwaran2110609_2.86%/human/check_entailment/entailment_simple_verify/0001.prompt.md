You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
def func():

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; p is a list of n integers where each integer p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.

    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, p is a list of n integers where each integer p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct. After executing the loop, the output consists of either "2" printed for each iteration where the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is met, or "3" printed for each iteration where the condition is not met.
    #
    #In natural language: The output state remains the same as the initial state, but with the addition of printed outputs from the loop. For each iteration of the loop, if the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is true, the number 2 is printed; otherwise, the number 3 is printed. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `p` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` is defined but not called.
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `x` (which should be equal to `n`).
   - It then reads the list of best friends `l` for each friend.

2. **Checking for Direct Best Friend Pair:**
   - The program iterates through the list `l` and checks if there exists a pair `(i, l[i] - 1)` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop because this means the two friends are each other's best friends, and sending invitations to both of them will ensure both come to the party.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

3. **Issue with the Program:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that finding a direct best friend pair (where `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`) guarantees that only 2 friends will come to the party.
   - This assumption is flawed because even if no direct best friend pair is found, it might still be possible to invite fewer than 3 friends to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Example Analysis:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `5`, `[3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`
  - The program correctly identifies that friends 4 and 5 are each other's best friends and prints `2`.
- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `4`, `[2, 3, 4, 1]`
  - The program incorrectly prints `3` because it does not find a direct best friend pair. However, inviting friends 1, 2, and 3 ensures that friends 1 and 2 come to the party.
- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `2`, `[2, 1]`
  - The program incorrectly prints `2` because it finds a direct best friend pair (friends 1 and 2), but inviting both friends 1 and 2 is unnecessary since only one invitation is needed.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it fails to find the minimum number of invitations required when no direct best friend pairs exist. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:

**False**
