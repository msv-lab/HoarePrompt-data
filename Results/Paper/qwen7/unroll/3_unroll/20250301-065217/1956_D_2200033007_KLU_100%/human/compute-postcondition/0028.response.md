The function `make_stairs` accepts a parameter `i`, which is an index of a list `arr`. The list `arr` is a list of non-negative integers with a length `n` such that 1 <= n <= 18, and `res` is an initially empty list that will store the operations performed. The function does not return anything since there is no return statement in the provided code. The current state of the variables remains unchanged after the function executes.

Functionality: **The function accepts an index `i` and performs operations on the list `arr` and the list `res`, but does not return any value. The state of the variables remains unchanged.**
