Postcondition: `is_already_stairs` is `False`, and either:
- All elements in the specified slice of `arr` from `start_index` to `start_index + i - 2` either match their indices or a mismatch was found during the iteration, and the current value of `arr[start_index + i - 1]` matches `i - 1`. In this case, `arr[start_index + i]` is undefined.
- All elements in the specified slice of `arr` from `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` are equal to `i`, and the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called. Additionally, `res` contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, and the element at `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is equal to `i - 1`.
