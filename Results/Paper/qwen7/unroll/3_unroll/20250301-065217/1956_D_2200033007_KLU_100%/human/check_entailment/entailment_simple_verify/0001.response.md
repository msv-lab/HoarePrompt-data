### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotated version to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Understanding:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
- Each operation involves setting all elements in a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to calculate the maximum possible sum using dynamic programming.
   - The function recursively divides the array into smaller subarrays and calculates the maximum sum for each subarray.
   - However, the function does not correctly compute the MEX value for any subarray. Instead, it seems to be trying to maximize the sum using a recursive approach without considering the actual MEX values.
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the MEX value and updating the array.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is supposed to find the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly identify the subarrays that need to be modified to achieve the maximum sum.
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed because it does not correctly handle the MEX values and the operations required to achieve the maximum sum.

3. **Function `make_stairs`:**
   - This function is a helper function that sets up the array to achieve the desired MEX values.
   - The function `make_stairs` is not used correctly and does not handle the MEX values properly.
   - The function does not correctly set the elements to the appropriate MEX values for the subarrays identified by `func_2`.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Use of Dynamic Programming:** The `func_1` function uses a recursive approach to calculate the maximum sum, but it does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the MEX value and updating the array.
- **Lack of MEX Calculation:** The code does not actually compute the MEX value for any subarray. Instead, it tries to maximize the sum using a recursive approach without considering the actual MEX values.
- **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`:** The logic in `func_2` is flawed because it does not correctly identify the subarrays that need to be modified to achieve the maximum sum.
- **No Handling of MEX Values:** The `make_stairs` function is not used correctly and does not handle the MEX values properly.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The code attempts to maximize the sum using a recursive approach without properly handling the MEX values and the operations required to achieve the maximum sum.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect because it does not properly calculate the MEX values and does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements.

**Final: False**

### Detailed Explanation:
- **Function `func_1`:** The function does not correctly compute the MEX value for any subarray. It tries to maximize the sum using a recursive approach without considering the actual MEX values.
- **Function `func_2`:** The function does not correctly identify the subarrays that need to be modified to achieve the maximum sum. It does not handle the MEX values properly.
- **Function `make_stairs`:** The function is not used correctly and does not handle the MEX values properly.

Since the code does not correctly handle the MEX values and the operations required to achieve the maximum sum, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
