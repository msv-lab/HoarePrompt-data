The function `make_stairs` accepts a parameter `i`. `i` is an integer representing the index of the list `arr`. The function does not return anything since there is no return statement in the provided code. The current state of the variables remains unchanged after the function execution. Therefore, the functionality of the function `make_stairs` is to accept an integer index `i` and perform operations on the list `arr` at that index without returning any value.
