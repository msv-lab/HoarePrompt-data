Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Approach**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be implementing a dynamic programming solution for a different problem (likely related to finding the maximum value in subarrays). However, the problem requires using the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) operation to maximize the sum of the array elements. The current implementation does not address the MEX operation at all.

2. **Lack of MEX Operation**: The core requirement of the problem is to use the MEX operation to set a segment of the array to the same value to maximize the sum. This is not implemented in the provided code.

3. **Recursive Structure**: The recursive structure in `func_1` and `func_2` seems to be aimed at partitioning the array into segments but does not incorporate the MEX operation or update the array accordingly.

4. **No MEX Calculation**: There is no function or logic to calculate the MEX of a segment of the array and then update the array based on this MEX value.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to implement the following steps:
- Calculate the MEX of any subarray.
- Update the subarray to the MEX value.
- Repeat this process to maximize the sum of the array.

Given these issues, the provided code cannot be considered correct for the given problem.
