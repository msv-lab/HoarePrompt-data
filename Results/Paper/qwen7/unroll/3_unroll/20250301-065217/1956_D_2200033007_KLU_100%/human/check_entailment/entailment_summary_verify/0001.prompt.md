You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `make_stairs` takes an index `i` and modifies the list `arr` based on certain conditions. It also appends operations to the list `res`. If `i` is 0, it adds a tuple to `res` and updates `arr[start_index]` to 1. If `i` is not 0, it recursively calls itself with `i-1` and performs additional operations. The function does not return any value and leaves the state of `arr` and `res` modified according to the conditions checked.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
   - Each operation involves setting all elements in a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code includes three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs`.
   - `func_1` seems to be intended to calculate the maximum possible sum using dynamic programming.
   - `func_2` is supposed to find the operations needed to achieve that sum.
   - `make_stairs` is a helper function that sets up the array to achieve the desired MEX values.

3. **Issues Identified:**
   - **Incorrect Use of Dynamic Programming:** The `func_1` function uses a recursive approach to calculate the maximum sum, but it does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the MEX value and updating the array.
   - **Lack of MEX Calculation:** The code does not actually compute the MEX value for any subarray. Instead, it tries to maximize the sum using a recursive approach without considering the actual MEX values.
   - **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`:** The logic in `func_2` is flawed because it does not correctly identify the subarrays that need to be modified to achieve the maximum sum.
   - **No Handling of MEX Values:** The `make_stairs` function is not used correctly and does not handle the MEX values properly.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect because it does not properly calculate the MEX values and does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements.
