Output State: **`is_already_stairs` is `False`, `res` contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, and all elements in the specified slice of `arr` from `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` are equal to `i`. The element at `arr[start_index + i]` is undefined, and the element at `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is equal to `i - 1`. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called.**

Explanation: The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called, but since no specific changes or returns are mentioned within the function, the variables `is_already_stairs`, `res`, and the slice of `arr` remain unchanged. The call to `make_stairs(i - 1)` itself does not alter the values of these variables directly.
