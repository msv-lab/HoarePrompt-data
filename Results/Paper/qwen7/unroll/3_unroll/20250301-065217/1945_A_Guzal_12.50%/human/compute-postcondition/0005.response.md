Functionality: The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). For each test case, it calculates a value \(k\) based on specific conditions involving \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). If the conditions are not met, it prints \(-1\); otherwise, it prints the accumulated value of \(k\) after processing all test cases. The function does not modify the input values \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) directly but uses them to determine the output.
