Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the position `n` and the number `x` for each test case.

2. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of possible values of `k` such that the settling pattern fits the given position `n` and the number `x`.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - The position `n` and the number `x` must satisfy certain conditions based on the settling pattern.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It returns the divisors in ascending order.

5. **Main Logic:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
     - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`
   - If either condition is true, it calls `func_1` on the respective value and processes the divisors.
   - It filters the divisors to find those that satisfy the conditions `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.

6. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program uses a set to remove duplicates before returning the result.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Condition Checking:**
   - The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` are necessary but not sufficient. They ensure that `2k - 2` divides `n + x - 2` and `n - x`, which implies `k` can be derived from these conditions.

2. **Divisor Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates all divisors of the given number.
   - However, the logic inside the main loop needs to be corrected to properly filter and count valid `k` values.

3. **Filtering and Counting:**
   - The filtering logic should correctly identify valid `k` values based on the divisor conditions.
   - The final output should be the count of valid `k` values.

### Corrected Program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []

    # Check the first condition
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        k = (n + x - 2) // 2 + 1
        if k > 1 and k % 2 == 0 and k // 2 >= x:
            output.append(k)

    # Check the second condition
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        k = (n - x) // 2 + 1
        if k > 1 and k % 2 == 0 and k // 2 >= x:
            output.append(k)

    output = list(set(output))
    print(len(output))
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has logical flaws in how it processes the divisors and filters the valid `k` values. The corrected program ensures that the conditions are correctly checked and filtered.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**
