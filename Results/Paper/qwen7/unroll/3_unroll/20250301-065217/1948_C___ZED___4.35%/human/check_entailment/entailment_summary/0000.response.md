Reasoning:
1. The program correctly processes multiple test cases.
2. It reads the necessary inputs for each test case: the number of columns `n`, and the two strings representing the arrows in the grid.
3. The logic for determining if a path exists from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell is flawed:
   - The condition `if b[-2] != '>'` checks only the second last character of the bottom row. This is insufficient to determine if a path exists, especially since the robot must follow the arrows and can only move within the grid.
   - The conditions for checking the path are not comprehensive enough. The program does not properly validate the entire path from the start to the end.
4. The program incorrectly handles the case where `n == 1`. Since `n` is even according to the problem constraints, this case should not occur, but the code still includes a check for it, which is unnecessary and might lead to confusion.
5. The program does not correctly handle the movement of the robot through the grid and the direction of the arrows.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

Correctness: **False**
