Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The logic in the program seems to be attempting to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the remaining elements in both subsequences non-decreasing. However, this approach does not guarantee the optimal solution for all cases.

Consider the following test case:
```
4
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

The correct minimum penalty for this case should be `3` because we can split the array into `s = [1, 3, 5]` and `t = [2, 4, 6]`, resulting in penalties `p(s) = 2` and `p(t) = 1`, so the total penalty is `3`.

However, the provided program will incorrectly output `0` for this case. This is because the program's logic does not correctly handle the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the elements in both subsequences are arranged in a way that minimizes the number of inversions (where `b_i > b_{i+1}`).

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is thus incorrect.
