Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
3. It initializes `la` and `lb` to `n + 1`, which ensures that any value in the array will be less than or equal to these initial values.
4. It then iterates through each element of the array, updating `la` and `lb` based on the current element's value relative to `la` and `lb`.
5. If the current element is greater than both `la` and `lb`, it means that the current element cannot be placed in either subsequence without increasing the penalty, so it updates `la` and `lb` and increments the answer `ans` by 1.
6. After processing all elements, it prints the answer `ans`, which represents the minimum possible penalty for the current test case.
7. The logic in the program correctly identifies the points at which the order of elements changes, ensuring that the penalty is minimized by splitting the array at those points.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
