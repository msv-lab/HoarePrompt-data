### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` processes a single test case.
   - It reads the integer `n` and the string `a` from the input.
   - It calculates the prefix sums of zeros and ones using the list `S`.
   - It iterates through all possible positions `i` where the road could be placed.
   - For each position `i`, it checks if placing the road there satisfies the condition that at least half of the residents on both sides are satisfied.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it updates the answer `ans` to be the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `i` and `n/2`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - This ensures that the logic in `func_1` is applied correctly to each test case.

3. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input handling is correct, reading the number of test cases and processing each test case individually.
   - The output is generated correctly by printing the result for each test case.

4. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the required conditions for placing the road.
   - The use of prefix sums (`S`) efficiently calculates the counts of zeros and ones on both sides of the potential road placement.
   - The check `left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum` ensures that the condition for at least half of the residents being satisfied on each side is met.
   - The final answer is the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `i` and `n/2` while satisfying the condition.
