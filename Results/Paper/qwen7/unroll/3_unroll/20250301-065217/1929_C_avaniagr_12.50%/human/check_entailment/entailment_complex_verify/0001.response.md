### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The program checks the conditions for `x` relative to `k - 1`:
     - If `x < k - 1`:
       - It checks if `a >= x + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - If `x == k - 1`:
       - It checks if `a >= x + 3`. If true, it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - If `x > k - 1`:
       - It calculates `z` using a loop where `z` is incremented based on the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x + 1` iterations.
       - It checks if `a >= z`. If true, it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - For `x < k - 1`:
     - The condition `a >= x + 1` ensures that Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario of losing up to `x` times in a row, plus one additional bet to recover.
     - This logic is correct because Sasha can always bet 1 coin after a loss until he wins again.
   - For `x == k - 1`:
     - The condition `a >= x + 3` ensures that Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario of losing `k - 1` times in a row and then winning twice to recover.
     - This logic is correct because Sasha can bet 1 coin after a loss until he wins again, and the recovery is possible within the constraints.
   - For `x > k - 1`:
     - The calculation of `z` ensures that Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row and then recovering.
     - The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` correctly models the growth of Sasha's coins after each loss and subsequent win.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `x` is less than `k - 1` and `x` equals `k - 1` correctly.
   - The loop for `x > k - 1` correctly calculates the required number of coins `z` to ensure Sasha can recover from losing `x` times in a row.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the logic for `x > k - 1` might not be entirely correct. Let's consider a specific example to validate this.

#### Example Validation

Consider the following test case:
- `k = 3`, `x = 5`, `a = 1`

- **Analysis:**
  - `x = 5` and `k = 3`, so `x > k - 1` (since `k - 1 = 2`).
  - The program calculates `z` as follows:
    ```python
    z = 0
    for i in range(6):  # x + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6
        z += z // 2 + 1
    ```
    - Iteration 1: `z = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
    - Iteration 2: `z = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`
    - Iteration 3: `z = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4`
    - Iteration 4: `z = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7`
    - Iteration 5: `z = 7 + 3 + 1 = 11`
    - Iteration 6: `z = 11 + 5 + 1 = 17`
    - So, `z = 17`.

- **Condition Check:**
  - The program checks if `a >= z`, which is `1 >= 17`. This condition is false.

- **Conclusion:**
  - The program should print 'NO' for this case, but it does not. This indicates that the logic for calculating `z` might be incorrect.

#### Corrected Logic

To correctly calculate `z`, we need to ensure that Sasha can recover from losing `x` times in a row and then winning enough times to recover. The correct approach is to use the formula for the sum of a geometric series.

The correct formula for `z` when `x > k - 1` should be:
\[ z = \left(\frac{k^{x+1} - 1}{k - 1}\right) - 1 \]

Let's update the program accordingly:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 3:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = (k**(x + 1) - 1) // (k - 1) - 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
```

With this corrected logic, the program should now correctly determine whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins.

### Final Evaluation

**Final: False**

The original program had an incorrect calculation for `z` when `x > k - 1`, leading to incorrect results in certain cases. The corrected logic ensures the program works as intended.
