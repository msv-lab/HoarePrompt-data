Functionality: **The function processes a series of inputs (t, k, x, a) where t is the number of iterations, k and x are integers, and a is a large integer. For each iteration, it checks specific conditions involving k, x, and a. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The final state of the program consists of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs for each iteration, based on the evaluated conditions.**
