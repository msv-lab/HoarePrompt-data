Output State: The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified within the loop. Specifically, it will depend on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` provided during each iteration of the loop, and whether these values meet the specified criteria. The value of `t` determines the number of times the loop will execute. After all iterations, the printed statements ('YES' or 'NO') will reflect the outcome of each condition check for the respective inputs.
