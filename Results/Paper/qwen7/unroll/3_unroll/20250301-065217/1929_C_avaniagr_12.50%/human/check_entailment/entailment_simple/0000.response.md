### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Conditions for Output**:
   - The program checks different conditions based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` to decide whether Sasha can achieve his goal of having any number of coins.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \)**
     - If Sasha can lose fewer times than the increase in bet size minus one, he can always win enough coins to exceed any target amount `n`.
     - This is because Sasha can keep increasing his bet after each win, ensuring he can recover from a small number of losses.
   - **Case 2: \( x = k - 1 \)**
     - If Sasha can lose exactly `k-1` times in a row, he needs a large enough initial amount to cover these losses plus the subsequent wins.
     - Specifically, Sasha needs at least `x + 3` coins to ensure he can recover after `x` losses and still have enough to win back.
   - **Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \)**
     - If Sasha can lose more than `k-1` times in a row, the program calculates the minimum number of coins required to ensure he can recover after `x` losses.
     - It uses a loop to compute the total number of coins needed, which is based on the geometric progression of the bet sizes.

4. **Calculation**:
   - The loop in Case 3 calculates the sum of a geometric series where each term is the previous term divided by `(k - 1)` plus one.
   - This ensures that even if Sasha loses `x` times in a row, he can still recover and eventually have more coins than needed.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' if Sasha can achieve his goal, and 'NO' otherwise.
   - The logic is consistent with the problem statement and the provided examples.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Sasha can achieve his goal of having any number of coins based on the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
