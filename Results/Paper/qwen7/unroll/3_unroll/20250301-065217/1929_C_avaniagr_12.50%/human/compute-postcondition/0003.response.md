Output State: The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided within the loop. Specifically, it will depend on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` entered during each iteration, with `t` indicating the number of iterations. Each line of output will either be 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether the conditions in the loop are met for the given inputs.
