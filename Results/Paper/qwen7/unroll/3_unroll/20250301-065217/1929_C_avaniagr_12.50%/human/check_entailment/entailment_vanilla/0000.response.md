Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The program checks the conditions for `x` relative to `k - 1`:
     - If `x < k - 1`:
       - It checks if `a >= x + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - If `x == k - 1`:
       - It checks if `a >= x + 3`. If true, it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - If `x > k - 1`:
       - It calculates `z` using a loop where `z` is incremented based on the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x + 1` iterations.
       - It checks if `a >= z`. If true, it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - For `x < k - 1`: 
     - The condition `a >= x + 1` ensures that Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario of losing up to `x` times in a row, plus one additional bet to recover.
     - This logic is correct because Sasha can always bet 1 coin after a loss until he wins again.
   - For `x == k - 1`:
     - The condition `a >= x + 3` ensures that Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario of losing `k - 1` times in a row and then winning twice to recover.
     - This logic is correct because Sasha can bet 1 coin after a loss until he wins again, and the recovery is possible within the constraints.
   - For `x > k - 1`:
     - The calculation of `z` ensures that Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row and then recovering.
     - The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` correctly models the growth of Sasha's coins after each loss and subsequent win.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `x` is less than `k - 1` and `x` equals `k - 1` correctly.
   - The loop for `x > k - 1` correctly calculates the required number of coins `z` to ensure Sasha can recover from losing `x` times in a row.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins given the constraints. The conditions and calculations are accurate and handle all specified scenarios.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
