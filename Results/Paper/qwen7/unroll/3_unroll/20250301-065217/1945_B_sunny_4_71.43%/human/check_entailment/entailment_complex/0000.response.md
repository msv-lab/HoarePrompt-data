Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. However, the logic used in the program is incorrect. The program calculates \(A\) and \(B\) as follows:
- \(A = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + 1\)
- \(B = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 1\)

These calculations represent the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period \(m\). However, the problem asks for the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously, not just the total number of fireworks launched within the visibility period.

To find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\). The LCM gives us the interval at which both installations launch fireworks at the same time. Within this interval, the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously would be the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation plus one additional firework that overlaps at the exact LCM interval.

The correct approach would be to calculate the LCM of \(a\) and \(b\) and then use it to determine the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks. However, the provided solution does not account for this and simply sums the individual contributions without considering the overlap.

Given the example inputs and outputs, the provided solution does not match the expected results. For instance, in the third test case (7 8 56), the correct answer should be 17, but the program incorrectly outputs 2.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
