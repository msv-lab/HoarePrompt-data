Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. Specifically, the program calculates `A` and `B` as the number of fireworks launched within `m` minutes from each installation, but it does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations. 

To illustrate, consider the following input:
- `a = 3`, `b = 4`, `m = 10`

According to the problem description, we need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. Let's manually calculate this:

- Fireworks from the first installation: launched at 0, 3, 6, 9 minutes.
- Fireworks from the second installation: launched at 0, 4, 8 minutes.

Within the first 10 minutes, the fireworks launched at 0, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 minutes are visible. This gives us a total of 6 fireworks visible at the same time, which is the correct answer.

However, the program calculates:
- `A = int(10 / 3) + 1 = 4`
- `B = int(10 / 4) + 1 = 3`

So, the program outputs `A + B = 4 + 3 = 7`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not handle the overlap of fireworks correctly and fails to provide the correct answer for some cases.
