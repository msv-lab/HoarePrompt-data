You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple lists of integers, each list containing between 1 and 100 integers (inclusive), where each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive). For each list, it counts the number of groups of three or more occurrences of each unique integer and sums these counts. Finally, it prints the total count of such groups across all processed lists.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads an integer `w` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` representing the number of sticks and then reads a list of stick lengths `palka`.

2. **Data Structure Initialization:**
   - A dictionary `d` is initialized to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - A list `pl` is initialized to store unique stick lengths.

3. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program iterates over each stick length in `palka`.
   - It updates the count of each stick length in the dictionary `d`.
   - It also ensures that each unique stick length is added to the list `pl`.

4. **Calculating Maximum Number of Polygons:**
   - The variable `shapes` is initialized to zero.
   - The program iterates over each unique stick length in `pl`.
   - For each unique stick length, it calculates how many complete polygons (triangles, squares, etc.) can be formed using the available sticks of that length.
   - The number of polygons is calculated as `d[j] // 3`, where `j` is the current unique stick length.
   - This value is added to `shapes`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all unique stick lengths, the total number of polygons `shapes` is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating `w` times.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The dictionary `d` correctly counts the occurrences of each stick length.
   - The list `pl` stores unique stick lengths, ensuring no stick length is counted multiple times in the polygon calculation.

3. **Polygon Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by dividing the count of each stick length by 3 (since each polygon needs at least 3 sides).
   - This calculation is correct for forming triangles, squares, pentagons, etc., as long as the stick lengths are sufficient.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct number of polygons for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks. It handles multiple test cases, counts stick lengths accurately, and calculates the number of polygons correctly.
