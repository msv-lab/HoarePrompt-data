Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an integer representing the number of iterations in the loop, each iteration processes a list of integers `palka` and calculates the number of shapes based on the frequency of elements in `palka`. After all iterations, `shapes` is the total sum of the number of groups of three or more occurrences of any integer across all lists processed.
