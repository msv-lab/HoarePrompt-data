### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case, which are the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Conditions and Calculations**:
   - The program checks if `b <= a`. If true, it calculates the profit as `n * a`, which is correct because all buns are sold at the usual price.
   - If `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, it calculates the profit using the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`. This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - (n - 1)`.
   - If `b > a` and `b - a < n`, it calculates the profit using the formula `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`. This formula accounts for the first `k` buns sold at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the logic and calculations appear to be correct. The program handles all specified conditions and outputs the correct profit for each test case.

### Correctness:
