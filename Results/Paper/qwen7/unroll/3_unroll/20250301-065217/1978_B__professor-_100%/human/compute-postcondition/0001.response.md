State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will iterate `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
3. The variable `_` is a placeholder used in the loop and does not affect the loop's execution condition. It is used to iterate over the range generated by `range(t)`.
4. The initial state of `t` as an input integer does not guarantee that the loop will execute if `t` is less than or equal to 0.
5. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is that `t` must be greater than 0.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0.
