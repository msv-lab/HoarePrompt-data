### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the string `s` which consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to process each test case.
   - It converts the string `s` into a list of characters for easier manipulation.

3. **Tandem Repeat Search**:
   - The function iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats from the largest possible (`n // 2`) down to 1.
   - For each length `j`, it checks every possible starting position `k` in the string.
   - If a character at position `k` or `k + j` is a question mark (`'?'`), it counts it as a match.
   - If both characters are not question marks and do not match, the count resets.
   - If the count reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` has been found, and the function prints `2 * j` and returns.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - If no tandem repeat is found during the iteration, the function prints `0`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where no tandem repeat can be formed by printing `0`.
   - The program also ensures that the total length of the strings over all test cases does not exceed 5000, as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing each question mark with a lowercase Latin letter. The program handles all test cases as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
