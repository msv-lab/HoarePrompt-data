You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

Example

Input

    4
    
    zaabaabz
    
    ?????
    
    code?????s
    
    codeforces

Output

    6
    4
    10
    0

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
    print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. It checks for the longest substring where each character matches the character `j` positions ahead, allowing for '?' as a wildcard. If such a substring is found, it prints `2 * j` and exits. If no such substring exists, it prints `0`. The function does not return anything but prints the result directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring. Specifically, the program checks for a tandem repeat by counting consecutive matching characters, but it does not ensure that the characters before and after the current position match to form a valid tandem repeat. 

For example, consider the input `"code?????s"`. The program will not correctly replace the question marks to form the longest possible tandem repeat. The correct output should be `10` (by replacing the question marks to form `"codes?????s"`), but the program will not achieve this because it does not attempt to form the longest possible tandem repeat by ensuring that the characters before and after the current position match.

To fix this, the program needs to attempt different replacements of question marks to form the longest possible tandem repeat, rather than just checking for consecutive matches.
