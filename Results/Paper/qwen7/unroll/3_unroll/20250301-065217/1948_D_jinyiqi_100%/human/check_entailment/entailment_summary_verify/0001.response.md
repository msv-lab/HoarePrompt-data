### Reasoning

The original assessment provided a detailed step-by-step analysis of the program and concluded that the core logic is correct. However, there is a minor issue noted in the implementation: the function `func_1()` is defined but not used. Instead, the main loop calls `func_1()` which is not necessary since `func_1()` is not defined to take any arguments other than the string `s`.

Here is the breakdown of the issues and the corrections:

1. **Redundant Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is unnecessary because the main loop already processes the string `s` directly.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` should be removed or modified to accept the string `s` as an argument if it is intended to be used separately.

3. **Core Logic**:
   - The core logic within `func_1()` is correct. It iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats, checks for valid tandem repeats, and prints the result accordingly.

Given these points, the core logic of the program is correct, and the program will produce the expected results for the given examples. The only issue is the redundant function definition, which can be simplified.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct in terms of functionality and produces the expected results. The redundancy in the function definition does not affect the correctness of the program.
