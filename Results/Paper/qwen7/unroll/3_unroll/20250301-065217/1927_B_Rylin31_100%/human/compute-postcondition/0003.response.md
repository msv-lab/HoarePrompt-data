Functionality: **The function accepts a single parameter `t`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case within `t`, it accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided information.**

Given the constraints and the lack of explicit return values in the provided output cases, it implies that the function processes the input data (test cases, `n`, and list `a`) without returning any specific value.
