Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, l is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ 2⋅10^5; s is a list of l integers initialized to 0; array is a list of l non-negative integers where 0 ≤ array_i < l; ans is a string; after executing the loop, ans is constructed by iterating through array, converting each index value to a character using the formula chr(s[array[j]] + 97), and appending it to ans while incrementing s[array[j]] by 1 for each iteration.
