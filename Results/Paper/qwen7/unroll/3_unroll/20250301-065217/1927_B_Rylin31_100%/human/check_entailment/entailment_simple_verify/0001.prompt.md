You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly generates a string `s` from the provided trace.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace array `array`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - A list `s` of length `l` is initialized with zeros.
   - An empty string `ans` is initialized to build the result.

3. **Processing Each Element in the Trace Array**:
   - For each element `j` in the trace array:
     - The character corresponding to the current value of `s[j]` is appended to `ans`.
     - The value at index `j` in `s` is incremented by 1.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in the trace array, the constructed string `ans` is printed.

### Reasoning:

- The logic of the program is to use the trace array to determine the positions of characters in the resulting string `s`. Specifically, `s[j]` indicates how many times the character at position `j` has appeared before the current position in the string.
- The program uses the trace array to decide which character to append at each position in the string. This is done by using the value at `s[j]` to determine the character (using `chr(s[j] + 97)`).

### Correctness Check:

1. **Trace Array Validation**:
   - The trace array `array` is validated to ensure that for each `a_i`, there is a valid index `j` such that `0 <= a_i < n`.

2. **Character Assignment**:
   - The assignment of characters based on the trace array is correct. The character at position `s[j]` is used to fill the string `ans`, and `s[j]` is incremented after each assignment.

3. **Guaranteed Validity**:
   - It is guaranteed that for the given trace, there exists a suitable string `s`. The program correctly constructs such a string by following the trace.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to generate a string `s` from the given trace array. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
