You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The given array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `flag` is False, t remains unchanged, n remains unchanged, arr remains unchanged.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: Output State: `flag` is False, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `val` is equal to `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is equal to 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates through the array `arr`. Since the initial value of `val` is set to `arr[0]`, the loop compares each element of `arr` with `arr[0]`. If an element matches `arr[0]`, `cnt` is incremented; otherwise, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`. However, since `cnt` starts at 0 and is only incremented when elements match `arr[0]`, and there is no decrement or reset of `cnt` within the loop, `cnt` will always be 0 unless there are multiple consecutive matching elements, which would then update `ans` to 1 (since `cnt` would reach 1 before being reset). Given the initial conditions and the lack of any resetting mechanism for `cnt`, `cnt` remains 0 throughout the loop, and `ans` is set to 0 if there are no matching elements.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: `flag` remains False, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `val` is equal to `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5), and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function processes these inputs to determine some property or perform some operation on the array a, and returns a result based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
