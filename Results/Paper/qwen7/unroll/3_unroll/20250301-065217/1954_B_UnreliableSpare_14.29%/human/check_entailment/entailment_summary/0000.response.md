Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the array is already constant (all elements are the same). If the array is constant, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum length of consecutive segments where all elements are the same as the first element of the array and prints this value.

However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Function `func_1` is not properly defined**: The function `func_1` should take the array as an argument to process it correctly. Instead, it is called without any arguments inside the main loop.
2. **Incorrect logic for finding the minimum segment length**: The code assumes that the array is not constant and tries to find the minimum length of segments where all elements are the same as the first element. This logic is flawed because it does not account for the condition that allows the array to become non-beautiful (i.e., removing elements to break the pattern).
3. **Use of `Decimal`**: The use of `decimal.Decimal` for comparison is unnecessary and incorrect here since the problem involves integer comparisons.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
