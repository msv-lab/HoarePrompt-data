Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `N + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 0` (since `range(N + 1)` generates values from `0` to `N` inclusive).

3. **Determine the value of `N`**: In the given code snippet, `N` is not explicitly defined but is implied to be the length of the list `nums` minus one because `nums` has an additional element `-1` appended to it.

4. **Initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, this is already correct.

5. **Value of `N`**: `N` should be the length of `nums` minus one, because `nums` has an extra `-1` appended to it. Therefore, `N` is actually `len(nums) - 1`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `i` should be `0`.
- `N` should be `len(nums) - 1`.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: `i` is 0, `N` is len(nums) - 1**
