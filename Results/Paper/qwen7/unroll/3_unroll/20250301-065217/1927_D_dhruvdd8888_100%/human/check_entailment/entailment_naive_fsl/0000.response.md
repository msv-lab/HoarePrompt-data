Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all elements in the queried subarray are the same. Specifically, in the `func_1` function, the program checks if `s > l` and `e >= r` to determine if there are different elements within the queried range. However, if all elements in the queried subarray are the same, both `s` and `e` will point to the same index, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5
5
1 1 1 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

The program will output:

```
-1 -1
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

However, for the query `1 2`, there should be a valid pair of indices since the subarray `[1, 1]` has the same element. The correct output should be `1 2`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it finds a different element within the queried subarray. One way to do this is to check if `s` and `e` are within the queried range and if they point to different elements. Here's a modified version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        num = nums[i]
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (l, r) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        (s, e, _) = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            if s < l or s > r or e < l or e > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
```

This modification ensures that the program correctly handles cases where all elements in the queried subarray are the same.
