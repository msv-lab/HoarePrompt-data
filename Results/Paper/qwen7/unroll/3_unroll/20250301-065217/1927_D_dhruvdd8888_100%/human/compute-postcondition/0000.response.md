Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n; `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.readline`**.

This code simply reassigns the function `input` to `sys.stdin.readline`, which changes how input is read from the standard input. However, it does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, or `r`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as per their initial conditions.
