### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified the key steps and logic in the provided program. Let's break down the program and verify each part again to ensure there are no overlooked issues.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads `N`, the size of the array.
   - It reads the array `nums` and appends `-1` at the end to handle boundary conditions easily.
   - It reads the number of queries `q`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program constructs intervals where the value of `nums` changes and stores them in `arr`.
   - This ensures that `arr` contains intervals where the value of `nums` remains constant.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant interval in `arr`.
   - It checks if the start of the interval is within the query bounds. If so, it prints the indices of the start and one position after the start.
   - If the end of the interval is within the query bounds, it prints the indices of the start and end of the interval.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints `-1 -1`.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Interval Construction:**
   - The interval construction logic correctly identifies segments where the array values are the same.
   - The logic ensures that each segment is stored as `(start_index, end_index, value)`.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - The query handling logic uses binary search to efficiently find the relevant segment.
   - The logic for printing the result based on the segment boundaries is correct.
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the start of the interval is greater than `l` or when the end of the interval is less than `r`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles cases where no valid pair exists by printing `-1 -1`.
   - The program also handles cases where the interval boundaries do not overlap with the query range.

### Conclusion

After re-evaluating the program, it is clear that the logic is sound and the program correctly implements the required functionality. The original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior and correctly identifies its correctness.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
