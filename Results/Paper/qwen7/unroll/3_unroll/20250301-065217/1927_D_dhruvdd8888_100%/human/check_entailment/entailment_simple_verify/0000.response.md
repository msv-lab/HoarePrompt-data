### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated code and the original assessment step-by-step to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Initial Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, the size of the array, the array itself, and the number of queries.
2. **Segmentation Logic**: The program segments the array into contiguous segments of identical elements and stores the start and end indices of these segments along with the value of the elements.
3. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program uses binary search to find the appropriate segment and then checks if the segment lies within the queried range. It then prints the indices of the elements in the segment if they are different, otherwise, it prints `-1 -1`.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Handling Segments**: The program correctly identifies segments of identical elements and stores them in `arr`.
2. **Query Validation**: The program checks if the segment lies within the queried range and ensures that the segment contains different elements.

#### Detailed Verification:
1. **Segmentation**:
   - The segmentation logic works correctly. It appends `-1` to `nums` to ensure the last segment is captured.
   - The `arr` list correctly stores the start and end indices of segments along with the value of the elements.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - The program uses `bisect_left` to find the appropriate segment in `arr`.
   - It checks if the segment's start index `s` is greater than `l`. If so, it further checks if `s` is within the queried range and if `s` and `e` are different.
   - If `s` is within the queried range and `e` is also within the queried range, it checks if `s` and `e` are different and prints the indices accordingly.
   - If `s` is outside the queried range or `e` is outside the queried range, it prints `-1 -1`.

#### Example Input:
Consider the example provided in the original assessment:
```
5
5
1 1 1 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

- **Query 1**: `1 5`
  - The segment is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
  - `s = 1` and `e = 5`.
  - Since `s` is greater than `l` and `e` is greater than `r`, it prints `-1 -1`.

- **Query 2**: `1 2`
  - The segment is `[1, 1]`.
  - `s = 1` and `e = 2`.
  - Since `s` is within the queried range but `e` is not, it prints `-1 -1`.

- **Query 3**: `1 3`
  - The segment is `[1, 1, 1]`.
  - `s = 1` and `e = 3`.
  - Since `s` is within the queried range but `e` is not, it prints `-1 -1`.

The program correctly handles the case where all elements in the queried subarray are the same and prints `-1 -1` as expected.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all cases, including when all elements in the queried subarray are the same.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
