### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
   - A beautiful array can be made into an array of identical elements by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Key Points to Check:**
   - The function should correctly identify segments where the array is not beautiful.
   - It should find the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty property.
   - If it's impossible to break the beauty property, it should return -1.

3. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It initializes `same` to count consecutive identical elements and `minn` to track the minimum segment length.
   - The loop iterates through the array, updating `num` and `same` as it finds segments of identical elements.
   - After processing the entire array, it checks if `minn` is still infinity (`inf`), indicating no segment was found where the elements were different.

4. **Issues in the Code:**
   - The logic to determine the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty property is flawed.
   - The current implementation only counts the length of segments of identical elements but does not correctly determine the minimum number of removals required.
   - The logic to update `minn` and handle the segments is not aligned with the problem requirements.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the longest segment of identical elements and calculate the number of removals needed to break the beauty property.
   - We should keep track of the maximum length of identical segments and use this information to determine the minimum number of removals.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
