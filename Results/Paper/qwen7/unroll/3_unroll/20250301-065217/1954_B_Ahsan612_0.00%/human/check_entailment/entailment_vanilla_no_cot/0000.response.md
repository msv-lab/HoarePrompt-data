Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed and does not accurately determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

Hereâ€™s why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimum Length of Consecutive Identical Elements:**
   - The program attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements but does not correctly handle the condition where the array needs to be modified to stop being beautiful.
   - It only counts the lengths of consecutive identical elements without considering the operations allowed to make the array non-beautiful.

2. **Misunderstanding the Problem:**
   - The program does not correctly simulate the operations to transform the array into one where the specified operation cannot be performed anymore.
   - It fails to consider the removal of elements strategically to break the beauty of the array.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to identify segments of the array where the specified operation can be performed and then determine the minimum number of elements to remove to prevent any such operation from being possible.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find all positions where the condition a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} holds
        operations = []
        i = 1
        while i < n - 1:
            if ar[i-1] == ar[i+1]:
                operations.append(i)
            i += 1
        
        if not operations:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # For each operation, calculate the minimum removals needed to break it
        min_removals = float('inf')
        for op in operations:
            left = op - 1
            right = op + 2
            count_left = 1
            count_right = 1
            
            # Count elements to the left of the operation
            while left > 0 and ar[left-1] == ar[op]:
                count_left += 1
                left -= 1
            
            # Count elements to the right of the operation
            while right < n and ar[right] == ar[op]:
                count_right += 1
                right += 1
            
            # Calculate total removals needed to break this operation
            total_removals = count_left + count_right - 1
            min_removals = min(min_removals, total_removals)
        
        print(min_removals)

func()
```

This approach correctly identifies the positions where the specified operation can be performed and calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break these operations.
