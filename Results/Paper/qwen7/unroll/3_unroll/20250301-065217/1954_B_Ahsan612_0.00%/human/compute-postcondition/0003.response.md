Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5), and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It returns a result based on the given test case parameters.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a specific number of test instances (t), along with an integer n and an array a of n integers. The function processes these inputs and produces a result for each test case, adhering to the specified constraints on t, n, and the elements of array a.
