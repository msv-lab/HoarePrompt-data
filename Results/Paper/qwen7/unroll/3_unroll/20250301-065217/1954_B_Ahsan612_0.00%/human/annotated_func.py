#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.

    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The variable `minn` is an integer representing the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same value in the array `ar`. If there are no such segments, `minn` is -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n and an array a of n integers. For each test case, it calculates the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same value in the array a. If there are no such segments, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum length found.
