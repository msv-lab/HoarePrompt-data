Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The variable minn is an integer representing the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of any number in the array a. If there are no such occurrences, minn is -1. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
