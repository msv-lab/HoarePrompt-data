Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of elements to remove from the array to make it non-beautiful. Specifically, the logic in the program does not accurately determine the minimum number of removals required.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

Consider the input:
```
4
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

The expected output is `1`, because removing the element at index `2` (value `1`) makes the array `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful.

However, the program outputs `-1`, which is incorrect. The program incorrectly sets `minn` to infinity and does not properly handle the logic to find the minimum number of removals needed.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly track the lengths of consecutive sequences of the same number and determine the minimum number of removals based on these sequences. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.
