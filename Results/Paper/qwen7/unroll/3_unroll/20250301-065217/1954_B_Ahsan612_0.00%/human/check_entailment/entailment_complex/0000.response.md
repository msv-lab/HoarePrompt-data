Reasoning:
The given program aims to solve the problem by identifying the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. The logic implemented in the function `func()` is flawed and does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Length of Consecutive Segments:**
   - The program attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same value in the array. However, it incorrectly calculates this minimum length.
   - The variable `same` is supposed to count the length of consecutive segments with the same value, but the logic inside the loop is flawed. It increments `same` without properly resetting it when a different value is encountered, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Non-Beautiful Arrays:**
   - The program checks if `minn` is infinite (`inf`) to determine if the array is non-beautiful. This is not the correct approach. Instead, the program should identify the smallest segment of consecutive identical values and calculate the number of removals needed to break these segments.

3. **Misunderstanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove so that the array is no longer beautiful. The current implementation does not correctly address this requirement.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
