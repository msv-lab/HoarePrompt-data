Output State: The output state depends on the input values for each iteration of the loop. For each input, the program compares the maximum possible scores for 'Bodya' and 'Sasha' based on the given rules and prints either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw'. The final output state is a series of these results for each iteration.
