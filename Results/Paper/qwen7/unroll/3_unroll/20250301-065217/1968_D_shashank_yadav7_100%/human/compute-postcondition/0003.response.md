Output State: The output state depends on the input values for each iteration of the loop. For each input, the program compares the maximum possible scores for 'Bodya' and 'Sasha' based on the given rules and prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' accordingly. After all iterations, the final printed result for each iteration is part of the output state.
