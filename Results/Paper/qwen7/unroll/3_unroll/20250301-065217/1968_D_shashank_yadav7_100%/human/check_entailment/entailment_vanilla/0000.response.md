Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b` (Bodya's starting position), and `s` (Sasha's starting position).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Starting Positions:**
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-based indices.

3. **Initial Scores Calculation:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya (`bp`) and Sasha (`sp`) are set to the values of `a` at their respective starting positions.
   - The maximum possible scores for Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`) are initialized to the product of `k` and the value of `a` at their starting positions.

4. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - In each turn, the positions of Bodya and Sasha are updated to their new positions according to the permutation `p`.
   - The scores are updated accordingly.
   - The maximum possible scores (`bm` and `sm`) are updated to reflect the best possible outcomes for each player.

5. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After `k` turns, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, and 'Draw' if the scores are equal.

### Correctness Analysis

The logic in the program seems to correctly simulate the game and calculate the scores for Bodya and Sasha. However, there are a few potential issues to consider:

1. **Position Update Logic:**
   - The positions are updated using `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`. This is correct because the positions are 0-based.
   - The scores are updated by adding the value of `a` at the new positions.

2. **Maximum Score Calculation:**
   - The maximum possible scores (`bm` and `sm`) are updated correctly based on the remaining turns `k`.

3. **Final Comparison:**
   - The final comparison between `bm` and `sm` is done correctly to determine the winner.

Given that the logic appears to be sound and matches the problem description, the program should work correctly under the given constraints.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
