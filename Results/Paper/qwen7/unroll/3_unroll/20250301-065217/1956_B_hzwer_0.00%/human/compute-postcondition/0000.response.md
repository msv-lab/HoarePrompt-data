Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 through n appears in a at most 2 times, n is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the list `a` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `t` and `a`, while updating `n` to reflect the input integer.
