Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is being iterated over using `range(n - 3, -1, -1)`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will start when `i` is `n - 3` and will decrement `i` until `i` reaches `-1`.

3. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = n - 3`, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to `n - 3` at the start of the loop.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`. Given that `i` starts at `n - 3`, the loop will always execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 2 (since `n - 3 >= -1` implies `n >= 2`).

5. **List the states that need to be adjusted**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we need to ensure that `i` is set to `n - 3` at the start of the loop. The other variables (`dp`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `cards`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `n - 3`**
