Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem, but it does not correctly model the game's rules and the optimal strategy for Nene. Specifically, the dynamic programming approach in `func_1` does not accurately represent the game's state transitions and the optimal moves for Nene.

Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect State Representation**: The DP table `dp[i][j]` is supposed to represent the maximum score you can achieve when you have `i` cards left in your hand and `j` points. However, the logic inside the nested loops does not correctly simulate the game's turns and the optimal strategy for Nene.

2. **Incorrect Transition Logic**: The logic inside the loops assumes that Nene will always try to maximize her score, which is not fully captured. For instance, the condition `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)` does not account for the fact that Nene might block your points by placing her cards strategically.

3. **Missing Optimal Strategy for Nene**: The problem states that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours. The current implementation does not enforce this behavior correctly.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game step-by-step, considering Nene's optimal moves. Here is a corrected approach:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count occurrences of each card
    card_count = [0] * (n + 1)
    for card in cards:
        card_count[card] += 1
    
    # Sort cards to facilitate optimal play
    sorted_cards = sorted(cards)
    
    score = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if card_count[sorted_cards[i]] == 2:
            # If the card is available twice, Nene will block it
            if card_count[sorted_cards[i]] == 2 and card_count[sorted_cards[i]] > card_count[sorted_cards[i + 1]]:
                score += 1
                card_count[sorted_cards[i]] -= 1
            else:
                card_count[sorted_cards[i]] -= 1
        else:
            card_count[sorted_cards[i]] -= 1
    
    return score

for _ in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())
```

This approach simulates the game step-by-step, ensuring that Nene always blocks your points when possible, and calculates your maximum score accordingly.
