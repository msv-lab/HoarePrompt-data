You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a predefined list `cards` containing `n` integers and calculates the maximum number of non-overlapping occurrences of consecutive integers that can be formed starting from index 0 in the list `cards`. The result, stored in `dp[0][0]`, is returned.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves two players, you and Nene, who play a card game. The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can get, assuming Nene plays optimally to minimize your score.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The provided solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of how the DP table `dp` is used:
   - `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum score you can achieve starting from the `i-th` card, having played `j` cards.
   - The outer loop iterates backward from `n-3` to `0`, representing the current card index.
   - The inner loop iterates backward from `n-1` to `0`, representing the number of cards played by Nene.

3. **Base Cases**:
   - `dp[n-1][0] = 0`: No cards played yet, no score.
   - `dp[n-2][0] = 0`: One card played by you, no score.

4. **DP Transition**:
   - If `cards.count(j+1) == 0`, it means the card `j+1` is not in your hand, so you skip it.
   - If `cards.count(j+1) == 1`, you have only one card with value `j+1`. You can either play it now or wait for the next turn.
   - If `cards.count(j+1) == 2`, you have two cards with value `j+1`. You can play one now and hope Nene doesn't play it, or play one later and ensure Nene doesn't play it.

5. **Optimization**:
   - The solution correctly handles the different scenarios for the count of each card in your hand.
   - The transitions ensure that you maximize your score while considering Nene's optimal moves.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the edge case where some cards might not be present in your hand.
   - The solution also considers the possibility of having two cards with the same value and the optimal strategy for playing them.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem as described.
