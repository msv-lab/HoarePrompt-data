Reasoning:

1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic to generate the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).
2. The function `func_1()` calculates the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) values but does not use these values to construct the permutation \( p \).
3. The logic inside the loop where `mex` is being populated does not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not ensure that the permutation \( p \) is constructed such that \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Initialize an empty list for the permutation \( p \).
- Iterate through the array \( a \) and use the MEX value to determine the next element in \( p \).
- Ensure that each element in \( p \) is unique and within the range \( [0, n-1] \).

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly generate the permutation \( p \) based on the provided array \( a \).

Correctness: **False**
