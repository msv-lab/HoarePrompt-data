Output State: t test cases are processed, each test case outputs a sequence of numbers. For each test case, given integers n and k (where k is even), the output is a sequence generated by a specific algorithm that alternates between two indices of an array from 1 to n. The first element of the output sequence is always 1, followed by a pattern that depends on the values of n and k.
