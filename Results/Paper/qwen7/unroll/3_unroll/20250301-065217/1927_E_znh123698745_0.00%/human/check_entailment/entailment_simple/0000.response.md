Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n.
2. A k-level permutation ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length k is at most 1.
3. The provided solution generates a sequence that alternates between two indices of an array from 1 to n, starting with the index 1.
4. The key logic in the code is the use of `a = [1, -1]` to alternate between two indices of the array `array`.
5. The loop iterates from 1 to n, appending elements to `answer` based on the current value of `i` and the values in `a`.
6. The initial condition ensures that the first element of the output sequence is always 1.
7. Given that k is even and the sequence alternates between two indices, it is designed to balance the sums of the segments of length k, ensuring that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums is at most 1.

Based on the above reasoning, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to generate a k-level permutation.

Correctness: **True**
