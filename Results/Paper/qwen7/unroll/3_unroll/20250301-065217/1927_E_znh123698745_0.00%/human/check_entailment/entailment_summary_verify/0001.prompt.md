You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        answer = [1]
        a = [1, -1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        print(*answer)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \) (where \( 2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( k \) is even). For each test case, it generates and prints a sequence of numbers based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \). The sequence starts with 1 and alternates between two indices of an array containing numbers from 1 to \( n \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly generates a k-level permutation for the given constraints.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - An initial list `array` is created with elements from 1 to `n`.
   - The variable `answer` starts with `[1]`.
   - Two indices `a` are initialized as `[1, -1]`.

3. **Building the Permutation:**
   - A loop runs from `1` to `n-1` to build the permutation.
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `(-1) ** i` is `-1`.
     - If true, it appends `array[a[-1]]` to `answer` and decrements `a[-1]` by 1.
     - If false, it appends `array[a[0]]` to `answer` and increments `a[0]` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The constructed permutation is printed.

### Detailed Check:

#### Example Test Case:
- Consider the test case `n = 10` and `k = 4`.
- The initial list `array` will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.
- The permutation construction logic will be:
  - `i = 1`: `(-1) ** 1 == -1`, so append `array[1] = 2` and decrement `a[-1]` to `0`.
  - `i = 2`: `(-1) ** 2 == 1`, so append `array[0] = 1` and increment `a[0]` to `1`.
  - `i = 3`: `(-1) ** 3 == -1`, so append `array[0] = 1` and increment `a[0]` to `2`.
  - Continue this pattern...

This approach does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. The logic used here is more of a zigzag pattern rather than ensuring the k-level property.

### Verification with Provided Example:

- For `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the expected output should be a permutation where the sums of every segment of length 4 differ by at most 1.
- The given solution does not guarantee this property.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly generate a k-level permutation because it does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
