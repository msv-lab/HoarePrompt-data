Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value that determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed**: The loop will execute as long as the input value (let's call it `num_tests`) is a positive integer. Given the constraints, `num_tests` must be within the range `[1, 10^4]`.

3. **Consider the Constraints**: The problem specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`. This means `num_tests` must satisfy the same constraint.

4. **Formulate the State**: We need to ensure that the input value (`num_tests`) is a positive integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value (`num_tests`) to be a positive integer within the range `[1, 10^4]`.

**State:**
**`num_tests` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_tests <= 10^4**
