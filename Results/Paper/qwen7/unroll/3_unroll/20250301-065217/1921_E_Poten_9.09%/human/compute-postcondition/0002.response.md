Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since `test_cases` is an integer input from the user and it must be within the range \(1 \leq \text{test\_cases} \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that `test_cases` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will be set to 0 at the beginning of the first iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `test_cases` (it must be greater than 0) and `i` (it must be 0).

**State:**
**`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
