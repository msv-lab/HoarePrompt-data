State: **`answers` is a list containing strings ('Draw', 'Bob', 'Alice'), `test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, and `j` is the first element in the list `answers`**.

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `j` is iterating over the elements of the list `answers`.
- For the loop to execute, the list `answers` must contain at least one element, and `test_cases` must be a valid integer within the specified range.
- Since `j` is the loop variable, it will take the value of the first element in the list `answers` during the first iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `answers` must be a list containing at least one string element.
- `test_cases` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4.
- `j` must be initialized to the first element in the list `answers`.

State: **`answers` is a list containing strings ('Draw', 'Bob', 'Alice'), `test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, and `j` is the first element in the list `answers`**.
