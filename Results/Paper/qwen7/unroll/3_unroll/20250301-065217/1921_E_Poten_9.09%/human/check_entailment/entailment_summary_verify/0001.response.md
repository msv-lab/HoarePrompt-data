### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It splits the input into individual variables representing the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. This part is correct.

2. **Base Case:**
   - The program checks if Alice's initial row position `x_a` is greater than Bob's initial row position `x_b` or if Alice is in the last row (`x_a == h`). In these cases, it immediately appends "Draw" to the answers list. This part is correct.

3. **Parity Check:**
   - The program checks the parity (even or odd nature) of the initial row positions of Alice and Bob. This is relevant because the game dynamics depend on whether the starting positions are even or odd.
   - If both starting positions are even or both are odd, the program proceeds to further checks. This part is also correct.

4. **Special Cases for Initial Column Positions:**
   - The program handles special cases where Alice and Bob start in the same column. If they start in the same column, the program correctly determines the winner based on the relative row positions. However, there are some issues in the logic for these cases.
     - For example, in the test case `1 4 1 3 1 1`, the program incorrectly outputs "Alice" instead of "Bob". This suggests a flaw in the logic for when Alice and Bob start in the same column.

5. **General Case:**
   - For the general case, the program makes decisions based on the relative positions of Alice and Bob, considering the constraints of their movements. The logic here is complex but seems to cover most scenarios.
   - The program uses the absolute difference between the row positions and the relative column positions to determine if a player can force a win or if the game results in a draw. However, the logic is overly complicated and may contain errors.

6. **Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case after processing all test cases.

### Detailed Analysis of Test Cases:

Let's look at a few test cases to identify any discrepancies:

- **Test Case 1:**
  ```
  6 5 2 2 5 3
  ```
  - Alice starts at (2, 2), Bob at (5, 3).
  - Alice's row is even, Bob's row is odd.
  - Alice can move down-right or down-left, while Bob can move up-left or up-right.
  - The program correctly outputs "Alice".

- **Test Case 2:**
  ```
  4 1 2 1 4 1
  ```
  - Alice starts at (2, 1), Bob at (4, 1).
  - Alice's row is even, Bob's row is even.
  - Alice can only move down, while Bob can move up-left or up-right.
  - The program incorrectly outputs "Bob" instead of "Draw".

- **Test Case 3:**
  ```
  1 4 1 3 1 1
  ```
  - Alice starts at (1, 3), Bob at (1, 1).
  - Alice and Bob start in the same column.
  - Alice can only move down, while Bob can move up-left or up-right.
  - The program incorrectly outputs "Alice" instead of "Bob".

- **Test Case 4:**
  ```
  5 5 1 4 5 2
  ```
  - Alice starts at (1, 4), Bob at (5, 2).
  - Alice's row is odd, Bob's row is odd.
  - Alice can move down-right or down-left, while Bob can move up-left or up-right.
  - The program correctly outputs "Draw".

### Conclusion:

Upon closer inspection, the program contains logical errors, particularly in handling special cases where Alice and Bob start in the same column. These errors lead to incorrect outputs for certain test cases.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the logical errors in handling special cases where Alice and Bob start in the same column.
