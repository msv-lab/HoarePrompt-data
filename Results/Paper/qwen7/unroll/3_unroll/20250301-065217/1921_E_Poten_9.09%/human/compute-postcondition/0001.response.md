Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer input from the user within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4; `answers` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `answers`. The value of `test_cases` remains unchanged as no operation is performed on it. All other variables (`t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`) also remain in their initial conditions since they are not mentioned or used in the given code snippet.
