Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, it calls `func_1()`, which takes two integers \( n \) and \( m \) as input.
3. Inside `func_1()`, it checks if the difference \( n - m \) is even and non-negative.
   - If the difference is even and non-negative, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

This logic is correct because:
- To end up with exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves, the number of additions must equal the number of removals plus \( m \). This implies \( n - m \) must be even (since every addition and removal cancels out, leaving an even difference for the net addition or removal).
- Additionally, \( n - m \) must be non-negative to ensure that the number of moves is sufficient to achieve the desired number of cubes.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
