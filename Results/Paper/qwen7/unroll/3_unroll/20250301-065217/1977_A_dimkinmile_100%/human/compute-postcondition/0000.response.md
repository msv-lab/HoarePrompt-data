Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds a positive integer value within the range 1 to 100.
