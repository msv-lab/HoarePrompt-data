Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is less than `m`. According to the problem description, Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move, so `n` (the total number of moves) must be greater than or equal to `m` (the final number of cubes). However, the current implementation does not check this condition. 

For example, consider the input `n = 2` and `m = 4`. The program will incorrectly output "Yes" because it only checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`, but it does not ensure that `n >= m`.

To fix this, you should add a check at the beginning of `func_1()` to ensure `n >= m` before proceeding with the calculation. Here is the corrected version:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < m:
        print('No')
    elif (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This ensures that the program correctly handles all potential cases according to the problem description.
