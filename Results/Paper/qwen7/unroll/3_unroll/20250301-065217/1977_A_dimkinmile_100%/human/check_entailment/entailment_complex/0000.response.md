Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even and non-negative.
   - If `(n - m)` is even and non-negative, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The condition `((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0)` ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative.
   - This means that for any valid `n` and `m`, the program will correctly determine whether it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "Yes" or "No" for each test case, which matches the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
