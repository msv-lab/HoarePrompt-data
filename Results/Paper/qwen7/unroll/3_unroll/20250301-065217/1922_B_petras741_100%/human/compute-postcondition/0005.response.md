Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of sub-cases, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5) representing the size of the list a, and a list a containing n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function returns a result for each sub-case based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer `t` indicating the number of subsequent sub-cases, an integer `n` indicating the length of the list `a`, and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. The function processes each sub-case according to the specified conditions and returns results accordingly.
