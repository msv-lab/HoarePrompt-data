Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. The states of other variables are not affected.**

This means that `t` now holds the value entered by the user, converted to an integer, and it must be within the range of 1 to 10^4. All other variables remain in their initial or unspecified states.
