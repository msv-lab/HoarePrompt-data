Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9, but these values are not directly passed as parameters to the function. Instead, the function returns different outputs based on the value of `t`.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over `t` test cases, processing pairs of integers `x` and `y` within the specified range for each case, but since the parameters `x` and `y` are not explicitly mentioned in the function definition, the function's primary responsibility seems to be handling the integer `t` and returning results based on its value.
