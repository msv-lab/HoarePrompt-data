State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.
2. For the loop to execute, `x` must be a positive integer because `range(x)` will generate numbers from 0 to `x-1`. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when entering the loop.
4. Since `t` is given as an integer between 1 and 100, it does not affect the loop's execution condition directly, but it is included in the initial state for completeness.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` (must be greater than 0) and `i` (initialized to 0).
