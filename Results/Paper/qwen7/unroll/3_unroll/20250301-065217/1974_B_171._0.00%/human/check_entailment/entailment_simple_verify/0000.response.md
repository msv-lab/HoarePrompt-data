### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Description and Correct Algorithm**:
   - The problem requires decoding a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm.
   - The auxiliary string \( r \) is formed by taking all distinct characters from the original string \( s \) and sorting them alphabetically.
   - Each character in the encoded string is replaced by its symmetric counterpart in \( r \).

2. **Current Implementation Analysis**:
   - The current implementation attempts to manually construct a mapping from each character in the encoded string to a character in the auxiliary string \( r \).
   - However, it does not correctly form the auxiliary string \( r \) and does not use the correct symmetric mapping.

3. **Example Walkthrough**:
   - Consider the encoded string `"serofedsoc"`.
   - The correct auxiliary string \( r \) should be `"cdefors"` (sorted distinct characters from the encoded string).
   - The decoding process should map:
     - `'s'` to `'c'`
     - `'e'` to `'f'`
     - `'r'` to `'o'`
     - `'o'` to `'r'`
     - `'f'` to `'e'`
     - `'d'` to `'d'`
     - `'s'` to `'c'`
     - `'o'` to `'r'`
     - `'c'` to `'s'`

   - The current implementation does not correctly handle this mapping because it tries to assign characters in a linear fashion without considering the correct order of characters in \( r \).

4. **Corrected Implementation**:
   - The corrected version of the `func_1` function constructs the auxiliary string \( r \) correctly and uses a reverse mapping to decode the string accurately.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct. The current implementation does not correctly decode the encoded string because it does not properly form the auxiliary string \( r \) and does not use the correct symmetric mapping. Therefore, the original assessment should be maintained.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect based on the problem description and the original assessment.
