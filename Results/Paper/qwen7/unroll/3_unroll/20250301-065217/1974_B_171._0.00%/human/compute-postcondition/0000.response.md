Output State: **`mapping` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `mapping`. Since `encoded` was the only variable mentioned in the initial state and no operations were performed on it, its state remains unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `mapping`, which is now an empty dictionary.
