Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to decode a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes an encoded string and decodes it.
   - A dictionary `mapping` is used to store the mapping from each character in the alphabet ('a' to 'z') to a character in the encoded string.
   - For each character in the encoded string:
     - If the character is already in the `mapping`, it is appended to the `decoded` list.
     - If the character is not in the `mapping`, the function tries to find a unique character from 'a' to 'z' that hasn't been used yet and maps it to the current character in the encoded string.
   - Finally, the function constructs and returns the decoded string by joining the characters in the `decoded` list based on the mappings created.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function ensures that each character from 'a' to 'z' is mapped to a unique character in the encoded string.
   - The function handles the case where a character in the encoded string might repeat by reusing the previously mapped character.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The logic for creating the `mapping` dictionary is correct. It ensures that each character in the alphabet is mapped to a unique character in the encoded string.
   - The process of constructing the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding mapped character is also correct.

Given the problem description and the provided logic, the function correctly decodes the encoded string.

Correctness: **True**
