Reasoning:
1. The provided program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the encoded string and calls the `func_1` function to decode it.
3. The `func_1` function aims to create a mapping between characters in the encoded string and their corresponding characters in the original string.
4. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. It tries to find the next available character in the alphabet to map to the current character in the encoded string, which does not correctly implement the required decoding process.

The correct approach should be:
- First, construct the auxiliary string `r` (which consists of all distinct letters of the string `s` in alphabetical order).
- Then, for each character in the encoded string, find its position in `r` and replace it with the character from the opposite end of `r`.

Let's correct the implementation:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        
        # Construct the auxiliary string r
        r = sorted(set(encoded))
        
        decoded = []
        for char in encoded:
            index = r.index(char)
            decoded.append(r[-(index + 1)])
        
        print(''.join(decoded))

def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # This function is not needed in the main logic but can be used for testing
    pass
```

With this corrected implementation, the program should correctly decode the encoded strings.

Correctness: **False**
