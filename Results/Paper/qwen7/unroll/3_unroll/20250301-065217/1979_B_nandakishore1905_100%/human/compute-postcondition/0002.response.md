Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed for each test case. For each test case, the value of `k` (which is `abs(n - m)`) will be processed through the conditions in the loop. If `k` is a power of 2, it will print `k`. If `k` is odd, it will print `1`. If `k` is even and not a power of 2, it will find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, subtract it from `k`, and continue this process until `k` becomes a power of 2 or 1, then print the final value of `k`.

In mathematical terms, the output will be either the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` or `1` if no such power exists.
