Output State: The value of `t` after all iterations of the loop have finished, which is the minimum cost calculated for each case provided by the input. For each case, the loop calculates the minimum cost to reach `pos_final` from `na_frente` by either swapping or passing, and prints the best (minimum) cost for each case.
