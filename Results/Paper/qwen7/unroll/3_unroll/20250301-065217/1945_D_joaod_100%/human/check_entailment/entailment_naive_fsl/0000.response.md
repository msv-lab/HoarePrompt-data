Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people in the queue. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the costs associated with swapping positions and passing through intermediate positions.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
3
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
6 2
6 9 7 1 8 3
5 8 8 1 4 1
7 7
7 2 9 2 6 5 9
9 1 10 7 1 4 9
2 1
2 3
1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
14
22
9
3
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
14
22
9
3
```

This is correct for the given examples, but let's consider another case to ensure the program works in all scenarios.

**Additional Test Case:**
```
3 2
10 10
1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Program Output:**
```
2
```

This test case seems to work correctly. However, let's consider a more complex scenario:

**Test Case:**
```
4 3
10 5 2 8
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
7
```

**Program Output:**
```
10
```

In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum cost. The correct approach would involve dynamically updating the minimum cost considering both the direct swap cost and the cumulative passing cost. The current implementation does not correctly handle the dynamic nature of the problem, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
