Output State: **`cases` is an input integer, and the initial state of `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

The code reads an integer from input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. This means `cases` now holds the number of test cases, but the initial state of `t` remains unchanged.
