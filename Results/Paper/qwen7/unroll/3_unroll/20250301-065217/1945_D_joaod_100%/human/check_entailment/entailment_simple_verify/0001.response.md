### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill.
   - It then reads the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts indices by subtracting 1 from `na_frente` and `pos_final` to make them zero-based.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `total` is initialized to 0.
   - `best` is set to a very large value (`sys.float_info.max`).

4. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop iterates from `na_frente` to 0 (inclusive).
   - For each position `v`:
     - If `v` is within the allowed final position (`v <= pos_final`):
       - It checks if the cost to swap with the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the cost to pass through the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`).
       - If swapping is cheaper, it updates `best` and adds `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to `total`.
       - Otherwise, it adds `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.
     - If `v` is beyond the allowed final position:
       - It directly adds the cost to pass through the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) to `total`.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, it prints the value of `best`, which is the minimum cost.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - The program correctly handles the boundary conditions where `v` is within the allowed final position and beyond it.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating the minimum cost is sound. It correctly chooses between swapping and passing based on the costs.

3. **Initialization and Final Value:**
   - The initial value of `best` is set to a very large value, ensuring that any valid cost will be lower.
   - The final value of `best` is correctly printed as the result.

4. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop iterates correctly from `na_frente` to 0, considering all positions.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initialization:**
  - `best` is initialized to `sys.float_info.max`, which ensures that any valid cost will be lower.
  - `total` is initialized to 0, which accumulates the cost as the loop progresses.

- **Main Loop:**
  - The loop iterates from `na_frente` to 0, considering all positions.
  - For each position `v`:
    - If `v` is within the allowed final position (`v <= pos_final`):
      - It checks if the cost to swap with the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the cost to pass through the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`).
      - If swapping is cheaper, it updates `best` and adds `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to `total`.
      - Otherwise, it adds `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.
    - If `v` is beyond the allowed final position:
      - It directly adds the cost to pass through the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) to `total`.

- **Output:**
  - After the loop, it prints the value of `best`, which is the minimum cost.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the code, the logic appears to be correct and handles all the specified conditions and constraints. The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case.

### Final Answer:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
