State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`. Given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), it must be within this range.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts, as `range(t)` begins counting from 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and `i` must be 0.
