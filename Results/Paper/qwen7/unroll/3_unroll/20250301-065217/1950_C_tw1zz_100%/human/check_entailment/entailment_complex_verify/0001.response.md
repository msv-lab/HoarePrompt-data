### Reasoning:

1. **Program Structure and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It splits the input string `hh:mm` into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`), which is done correctly using `map(str, input().split(':'))`.

2. **Handling Hours**:
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format. This approach is indeed inefficient and repetitive, but it does cover all possible cases from 00 to 23.
   - The program correctly handles the conversion for hours 01 to 11, 12, 13 to 23, and 00 (which is treated as 12).

3. **Handling AM/PM**:
   - The program correctly assigns the AM/PM designation based on the hour. However, there are some issues:
     - For `h == '00'`, it correctly assigns `h1 = '12'` and `time = 'AM'`.
     - For `h == '12'`, it correctly assigns `h1 = '12'` and `time = 'PM'`.
     - For other hours, it correctly assigns the appropriate hour and AM/PM designation.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the time in the correct format `"h1 : m AM/PM"`, which matches the required output format.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `h` is 00 and 12 correctly.
   - It also handles all other cases from 01 to 23 correctly.

6. **Generalization**:
   - While the program is repetitive, it does cover all possible cases in the 24-hour format and correctly converts them to the 12-hour format.

### Conclusion:
Despite the repetitive nature of the code, the program correctly handles all possible inputs within the specified constraints. The original assessment correctly pointed out the inefficiency and potential for error in the current implementation, but the program itself does handle all cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
