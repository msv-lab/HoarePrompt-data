Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a time in the format "h1 : m AM/PM". The values of `h1` and `m` are derived from the input time `h:m`, and the AM/PM designation is adjusted based on the original hour `h`. Each line represents the converted time for a given input, with `h1` being the hour in 12-hour format and `time` being either 'AM' or 'PM'. The exact times will depend on the inputs provided during the loop executions.
