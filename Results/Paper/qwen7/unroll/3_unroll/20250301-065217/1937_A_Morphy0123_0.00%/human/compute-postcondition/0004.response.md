Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case involves two integers: t and n. For each test case, t is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and n is an integer within the range 1 to 10^9. The function processes these values and returns different outputs based on the relationship between t and n.**

This description adheres to the given constraints and relationships between the input parameters, without detailing the internal operations of the function.
