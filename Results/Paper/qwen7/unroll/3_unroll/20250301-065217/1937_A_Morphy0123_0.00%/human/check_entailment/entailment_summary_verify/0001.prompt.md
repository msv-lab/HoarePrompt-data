You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program:
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers: t and n. It reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the value of n. Depending on the value of n, it prints either 1, \(2^{power}\), or \(2^{(power - 1)}\). Here, \(power\) is incremented until it is no longer less than the base-2 logarithm of \(n\), and then adjusted if necessary before printing the result. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Single Element Array:**
   - If `n` is 1, the array is `[1]`, and the position of `1` is `1`. This part is correctly handled by printing `1`.

3. **General Case (n > 1):**
   - The program calculates the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` using `log2(n)` and a loop.
   - It checks if `power` equals `n`. If so, it prints `2 ** power`.
   - Otherwise, it decrements `power` by 1 and prints `2 ** power`.

### Detailed Analysis

- **Largest Divisor Operation:**
  - The problem specifies that the swap operation involves swapping `a_d` and `a_k` where `d` is the largest divisor of `k` that is not `k` itself.
  - The given implementation does not actually perform any swaps; instead, it calculates powers of 2.

- **Power Calculation:**
  - The calculation of the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` is correct.
  - However, the logic for determining the position of `1` is flawed. The position of `1` should be determined by the sequence of swaps, not by the highest power of 2.

### Example Walkthrough

- For `n = 4`:
  - The initial array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
  - Swaps:
    - `swap(2)`: `[2, 1, 3, 4]`
    - `swap(3)`: `[2, 1, 3, 4]` (no change since 3 is prime)
    - `swap(4)`: `[2, 1, 4, 3]`
  - Final array: `[2, 1, 4, 3]`.
  - Position of `1` is `2`, not `4`.

- For `n = 5`:
  - Initial array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
  - Swaps:
    - `swap(2)`: `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]`
    - `swap(3)`: `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]` (no change since 3 is prime)
    - `swap(4)`: `[2, 1, 4, 3, 5]`
    - `swap(5)`: `[2, 1, 4, 3, 5]` (no change since 5 is prime)
  - Final array: `[2, 1, 4, 3, 5]`.
  - Position of `1` is `2`, not `4`.

- For `n = 120240229`:
  - The position of `1` would be determined by the sequence of swaps, not by the highest power of 2.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the swap operation as specified in the problem statement. It incorrectly calculates the position of `1` based on powers of 2 rather than the actual sequence of swaps.
