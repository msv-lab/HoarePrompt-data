Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n_cases`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly involved in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `n_cases` is an input integer. This variable is used in the loop condition.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n_cases`. Therefore, `i` should start from 0 and `n_cases` should be a positive integer.

4. **Initial Values**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, we need to set `i` to 0.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n_cases` must be greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` should be set to 0.
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0.

Based on these steps, the adjusted state before the loop starts is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0**
