Functionality: **The function reads two integers \(x\) and \(n\) from input, where \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\). It then calculates and prints the maximum value between any divisor \(i\) of \(x\) and \(x//i\) where both \(i\) and \(x//i\) are greater than or equal to \(n\). The function processes up to \(10^3\) test cases.**
