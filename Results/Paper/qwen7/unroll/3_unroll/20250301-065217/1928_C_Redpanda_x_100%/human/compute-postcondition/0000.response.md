Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `factors` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary named `factors`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. Therefore, `n` is still a positive integer greater than 1, and `factors` is an empty dictionary.
