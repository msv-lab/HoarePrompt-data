Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop `for i in range(t)` will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 10^6\).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop depends on `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer.
   - The value of `s` is not relevant to the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` being a positive integer.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
