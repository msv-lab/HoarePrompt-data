Correctness: **False**

The provided Python function does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Handling Single Character Strings**: The function correctly handles single character strings by printing "NO". However, the logic can be simplified and made more robust.

2. **General Palindrome Check**: The function attempts to check if the string can be split into non-palindromic substrings but has several inefficiencies and logical errors.
   - It incorrectly assumes that finding a mismatch between characters at symmetric positions will always result in a valid partition.
   - It fails to consider all possible valid partitions, especially when the string has repeating characters.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases well, such as strings with all identical characters or strings where removing a single character results in a non-palindromic string.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input().strip()
        n = len(string)
        
        # If the string length is 1, it cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings
        if n == 1:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # Try to find a non-palindromic substring
        for j in range(n // 2):
            if string[j] != string[n - 1 - j]:
                print("YES")
                print(2)
                print(string[:j+1], string[j+1:])
                break
        else:
            # If no such pair is found, check if the entire string is a palindrome
            if string == string[::-1]:
                print("NO")
            else:
                # If the string is not a palindrome, we can split it into two non-palindromic substrings
                print("YES")
                print(2)
                mid = n // 2
                print(string[:mid], string[mid:])
```

This corrected function:
- Checks if the string length is 1 and prints "NO".
- Attempts to find a mismatch between characters at symmetric positions to determine if the string can be split into non-palindromic substrings.
- If no such mismatch is found, it checks if the entire string is a palindrome. If it is, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it splits the string into two non-palindromic substrings and prints the result.
