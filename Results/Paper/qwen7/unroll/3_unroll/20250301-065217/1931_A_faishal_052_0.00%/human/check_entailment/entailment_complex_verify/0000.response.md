### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code to understand why the original assessment is accurate.

#### Key Issues in the Provided Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `lex` Value:**
   - The program incorrectly handles the `lex` value when it is between 27 and 51. Specifically, it appends `26` to `arr` and subtracts `26` from `lex`, which can lead to invalid values like `-3` (as seen in the example with `lex = 24`).

2. **Sorting and Character Generation:**
   - The program sorts the array `arr` and then prints the characters corresponding to the sorted values. However, the sorting step is unnecessary and incorrect because the characters should be directly determined based on the value of `lex` without sorting.

3. **Lexicographically Smallest Word:**
   - The program does not ensure that the generated word is lexicographically smallest. For example, for `lex = 24`, the program generates `azw` instead of `aav`.

#### Correct Approach:

To generate the lexicographically smallest word, we need to determine the characters based on the value of `lex` without sorting. Hereâ€™s how we can do it:

1. **Determine the First Character:**
   - The first character should always be `'a'` unless `lex` is less than 26, in which case the first character should be the corresponding character based on the value of `lex`.

2. **Determine the Second Character:**
   - The second character should always be `'z'` unless `lex` is less than 52, in which case the second character should be the corresponding character based on the value of `lex % 26`.

3. **Determine the Third Character:**
   - The third character should be the remaining value of `lex` after accounting for the first two characters.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        
        # Determine the first character
        if lex < 26:
            first_char = chr(lex + 96)
            lex -= lex
        else:
            first_char = 'a'
            lex -= 26
        
        # Determine the second character
        if lex < 26:
            second_char = chr(lex + 96)
            lex -= lex
        else:
            second_char = 'z'
            lex -= 26
        
        # Determine the third character
        third_char = chr(lex + 96)
        
        print(first_char, second_char, third_char)
```

### Final Evaluation:

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle all cases and does not ensure that the generated word is lexicographically smallest.

**Final: False**
