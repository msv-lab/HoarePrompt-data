Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Calculating Characters**: The program attempts to break down the encoded value into characters by repeatedly subtracting 26, which is not appropriate for all cases. For instance, for the input `24`, the program incorrectly generates `'aav'` instead of the correct answer `'aaa'`.

2. **Character Calculation**: The program should consider the possible values for each character in the word and ensure that the smallest possible characters are chosen. It should iterate over possible values for the first two characters and then determine the third character based on the remaining value.

3. **Sorting and Character Conversion**: The current approach of sorting the array `arr` and converting it to characters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)` is flawed because it does not account for the correct distribution of values among the three characters.

Given these issues, the program does not produce the correct lexicographically smallest word for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
