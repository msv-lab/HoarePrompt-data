Output State: **`cases` is an input integer, and `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.**

Explanation: The code `cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 100.
