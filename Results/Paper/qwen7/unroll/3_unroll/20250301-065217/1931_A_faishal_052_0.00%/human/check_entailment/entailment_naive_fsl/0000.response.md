Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the generated word is lexicographically smallest. Hereâ€™s a counterexample:

For the input `24`, the expected output is `aav`, but the program generates a different word. Let's walk through the logic of the program:

1. For `lex = 24`:
   - The program checks if `lex` is less than or equal to 26. Since `24 <= 26`, it appends `1` to `arr` and sets `lex` to `24 - 1 = 23`.
   - It then checks again, and since `23 < 52`, it appends `26` to `arr` and sets `lex` to `23 - 26 = -3`. This step is incorrect because `lex` cannot be negative.
   - Finally, it appends `23` (the remaining value of `lex`) to `arr`.

2. After sorting `arr` (which will be `[1, 26, 23]`), the program prints the characters corresponding to these indices plus 96 (`chr(1 + 96)` gives `a`, `chr(26 + 96)` gives `z`, and `chr(23 + 96)` gives `w`).

Thus, the program outputs `azw` instead of `aav`. This shows that the program does not generate the lexicographically smallest word for all inputs, making it incorrect.
