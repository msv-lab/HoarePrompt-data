Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, the value of `t` remains within this range after the assignment. All other variables (`n` and the array `a`) are not affected by this line of code.
