Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
2. A beautiful array can be modified by replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
3. The provided solution correctly identifies the minimum number of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element in the list `a`.
4. If all elements in the list are the same, the function correctly outputs `-1` because removing any element would not change the fact that the array remains beautiful.
5. The logic for finding the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element is sound and correctly implemented.
6. The overall structure of the function handles multiple test cases as required.

Given the above points, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
