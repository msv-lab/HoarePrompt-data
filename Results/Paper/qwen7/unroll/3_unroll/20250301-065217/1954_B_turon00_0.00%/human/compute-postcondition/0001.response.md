State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, _ is not relevant as it is a dummy variable**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is a dummy variable used to iterate `t` times. It does not hold any specific value within the loop and its initial state does not affect the loop's execution.
- The variable `t` determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute, `t` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring `t` is within the specified range.
