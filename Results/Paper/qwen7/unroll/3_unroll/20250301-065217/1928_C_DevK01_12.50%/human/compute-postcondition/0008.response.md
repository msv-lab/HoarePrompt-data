Output State: **q is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, M is an empty list, w is the integer part of the square root of q, and x is not used or defined in the final state.**

Explanation: The loop conditions and operations do not modify `q`, `w`, or `x`. The variable `M` starts as an empty list and the loop does not add any elements to it because the conditions `if i >= x - 1:` and `if q // i >= x - 1:` are never met (since `x` is not defined). Therefore, `M` remains an empty list after the loop finishes.
