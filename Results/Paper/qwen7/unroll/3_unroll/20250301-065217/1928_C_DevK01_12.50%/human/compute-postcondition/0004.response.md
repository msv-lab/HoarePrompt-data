Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 100, `M` is a list containing the integer division of `w` by 1, `w` is the square root of `q`, and the current value of `w` is equal to its integer division by 1 and is greater than or equal to `x` - 1.**

Explanation: The code `M += [w]` appends the value of `w` to the list `M`. Since `w` is defined as the integer division of the square root of `q` by 1, and the integer division of any number by 1 is the number itself, `w` remains unchanged. Therefore, `M` now contains the value of `w`, which is the integer division of the square root of `q` by 1. All other conditions and values remain as stated in the initial state.
