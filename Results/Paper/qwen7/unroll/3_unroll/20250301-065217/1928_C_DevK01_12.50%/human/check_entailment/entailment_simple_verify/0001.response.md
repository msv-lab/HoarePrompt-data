### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step using the annotated code and the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `x` for each case.

2. **Calculating `y`:**
   - `y = n + x` is calculated, which is necessary for determining the possible values of `k`.

3. **Checking Parity of `y`:**
   - If `y` is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if `y` is odd, no valid `k` can exist since `2k - 2` must be even.

4. **Calling `func_1`:**
   - If `y` is even, it calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` and stores the result in `L1`.
   - It then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2`, and if true, it adds the result of `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to `L1`.

5. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - `L1` is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then the length of the set is printed.

6. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` calculates the divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - This function is used to find valid `k` values.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`:

- **Divisor Calculation:**
  - The function correctly identifies all divisors of the input `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
  - It uses a loop to check for divisors from `1` to `int(w // 1)`, where `w` is the square root of `q`.

### Correctness Verification:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case when `y` is odd correctly by printing `0`.
  - The function `func_1` correctly identifies valid `k` values by checking divisors.

- **Logic Flow:**
  - The logic flow is correct and follows the problem statement accurately.
  - However, there is a critical issue with the way `func_1` is used in the main program.

### Issue with `func_1` Usage:

- **Main Program Logic:**
  - The main program calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` and then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2`. If true, it calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` and adds the results.
  - The issue arises because `func_1` is called with `q = (y - 2) // 2` and `q = (n - x) // 2`, but these values do not necessarily represent the correct range for `k`.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `n = 10`, `x = 2`
  - `y = 12`, which is even.
  - `func_1((12 - 2) // 2, 2) = func_1(5, 2)` returns `[3]`.
  - Since `10 >= 3 * 2 - 2`, we also call `func_1((10 - 2) // 2, 2) = func_1(4, 2)` which returns `[3, 2]`.
  - `L1 = [3, 2]` after removing duplicates, and the length is `2`, which is incorrect.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `n = 3`, `x = 1`
  - `y = 4`, which is even.
  - `func_1((4 - 2) // 2, 1) = func_1(1, 1)` returns `[1]`.
  - Since `3 >= 3 * 1 - 2`, we also call `func_1((3 - 1) // 2, 1) = func_1(1, 1)` which returns `[1]`.
  - `L1 = [1]` after removing duplicates, and the length is `1`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:

The main issue lies in the way `func_1` is used in the main program. The values passed to `func_1` do not correctly represent the range for `k`. Therefore, the program is not correctly identifying all valid `k` values.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
