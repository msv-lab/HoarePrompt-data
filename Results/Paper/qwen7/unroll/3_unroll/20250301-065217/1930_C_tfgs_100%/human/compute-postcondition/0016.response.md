Based on the initial state provided:

- `counter`, `a`, `t`, `n`, `cur`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is a list containing all elements of `a` followed by `cnt` additional elements, each of which is one less than the previous element in `ans`.

Let's break down the components:

1. **`a`**: This is a list whose elements are part of the final `ans` list.
2. **`cnt`**: This is the number of times the loop iterates, and it determines how many additional elements are added to `ans` after all elements of `a`.
3. **Additional elements in `ans`**: These elements start from the last element of `a` and decrease by 1 for each subsequent element until `cnt` elements have been added.

Given this, the `ans` list will look like this:
- First, all elements of `a` are included.
- Then, `cnt` additional elements are appended, starting from the last element of `a` and decreasing by 1 for each subsequent element.

For example, if `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `cnt = 3`, then `ans` would be `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0]`.

Therefore, the `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

Output: **what is printed is a list of elements where all elements of `a` are followed by `cnt` additional elements, each of which is one less than the previous element in `ans`**
