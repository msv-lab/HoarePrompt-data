Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(cnt):`. The only variable here is `cnt`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `cnt`**: According to the given information, `cnt` is initially set to 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `cnt` is greater than 0. Since `cnt` starts at 0, the loop will not execute initially unless `cnt` is modified within the loop or by some external means.

4. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, `cnt` must be greater than 0. Given the initial value of `cnt` is 0, we need to adjust it to a value greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `cnt` to be greater than 0.

**State:**
**`cnt` must be greater than 0**
