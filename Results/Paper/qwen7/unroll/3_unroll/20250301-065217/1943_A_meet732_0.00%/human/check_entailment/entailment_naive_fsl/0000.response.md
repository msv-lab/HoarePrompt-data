Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and the calculation of the MEX value. Specifically, the program does not account for the optimal strategies of both players. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice should aim to maximize the MEX value by ensuring that the smallest missing number is as large as possible. This means Alice should avoid picking elements that would create smaller gaps in the sequence of numbers in `c`.

2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob should aim to minimize the MEX value by picking elements that fill in the gaps created by Alice's moves.

The current implementation does not simulate these strategies. Instead, it simply counts occurrences of each number and prints the minimum required number to achieve the MEX value without considering the optimal moves of both players.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

- **First Test Case**: The optimal play would result in `c = [1, 0]`, leading to a MEX of 2. However, the program outputs 2, which seems correct in this case.
- **Second Test Case**: The optimal play would result in `c = [2, 1, 0]`, leading to a MEX of 3. However, the program outputs 1, which is incorrect.
- **Third Test Case**: The optimal play would result in `c = [1]`, leading to a MEX of 0. However, the program outputs 0, which seems correct in this case.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the optimal moves of both players, which involves more complex logic than just counting occurrences. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.
