Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the game logic and calculates the MEX of the array `c` optimally.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - It initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It populates `cntl` by iterating through `a` and incrementing the count for each element.

3. **Initial MEX Calculation:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is zero, it means no zero is present in `a`, so the MEX is 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the initial value of `c` as the minimum of 2 and the count of zeros (`cntl[0]`).

4. **Adjusting MEX:**
   - It iterates through the counts from 1 to `n` and decreases `c` for each element that appears less than twice.
   - If `c` becomes zero or the loop reaches the end of the `cntl` list, it prints the current index `j` as the MEX.

### Correctness Check

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - If there are no zeros in `a`, the program correctly prints 0.
   - If there are zeros, the program attempts to calculate the MEX optimally by considering the counts of elements.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The program aims to maximize the MEX for Alice and minimize it for Bob.
   - By setting `c` to the minimum of 2 and the count of zeros, it ensures that Alice can always place at least two zeros in `c` initially.
   - Subsequently, reducing `c` for other elements ensures that Bob cannot easily reduce the MEX by placing elements that are already in `c`.

3. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c` by iterating through the counts and adjusting `c` accordingly.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the MEX under optimal play conditions. The program handles edge cases appropriately and follows the rules of the game.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
