#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c or j == n:
                        print(j)
                        break
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. After executing the loop, if cntl[0] is not zero, then c is set to the minimum of 2 and cntl[0], and the loop checks if cntl[j] is less than 2 for each j from 1 to n. If cntl[j] is less than 2, c is decremented. The loop prints j when c becomes 0 or when j equals n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( n \), a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers, and another positive integer \( t \). For each test case, it first checks if \( t \) is within the range 1 to 20,000. Then, it counts the occurrences of each integer in the list \( a \) and stores these counts in the list `cntl`. Based on the count of zeros (`cntl[0]`) and the counts of other integers, it determines and prints the smallest index \( j \) (starting from 1) such that the count of \( j \) in the list \( a \) is less than 2. If no such \( j \) exists, it prints 0. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
