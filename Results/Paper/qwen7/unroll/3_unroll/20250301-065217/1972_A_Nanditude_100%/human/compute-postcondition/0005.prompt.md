You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. a and b are lists of integers of length n, where a and b are sorted in non-decreasing order. Each element in a and b is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        for j in range(n):
            if b[j] < a[i]:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. For each iteration of the outer loop, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, and b is a list of integers. After all iterations, cnt is the sum of counts where elements in list b are less than the corresponding elements in list a, across all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, n, a, and b, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), n is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and a and b are lists of n positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, with each integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The function returns a value based on the comparison or processing of these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
