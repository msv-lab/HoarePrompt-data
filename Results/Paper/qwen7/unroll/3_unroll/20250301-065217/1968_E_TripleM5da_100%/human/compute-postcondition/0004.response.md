Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and outputs a specific sequence of pairs. It first prints "1 1" and "1 2", followed by pairs of numbers from 3 to \( n \), each number paired with itself. If \( n \) is within the range 2 to \( 10^3 \), the function completes successfully; otherwise, it does not explicitly return anything different but stops processing for that test case.**
