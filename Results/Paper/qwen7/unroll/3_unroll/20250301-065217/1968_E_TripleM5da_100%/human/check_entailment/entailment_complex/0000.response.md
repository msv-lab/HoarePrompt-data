Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\), which contains distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The annotated program suggests a fixed pattern for generating the coordinates: 
   - It always prints "1 1" and "1 2" as the first two lines.
   - For the remaining lines, it prints pairs of the form \((i, i)\) for \(i\) ranging from 3 to \(n\).
3. Let's analyze if this pattern maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\):

   - For \(n = 2\):
     - Coordinates: (1, 1), (1, 2)
     - Distances: \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\), \(|1-1| + |2-2| = 0\), \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
     - Set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), size = 2 (correct).

   - For \(n = 3\):
     - Coordinates: (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3)
     - Distances: \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\), \(|1-1| + |2-2| = 0\), \(|1-1| + |3-3| = 0\), \(|1-1| + |1-3| = 2\), \(|1-2| + |1-2| = 2\), \(|1-3| + |3-3| = 2\), \(|2-3| + |2-3| = 2\)
     - Set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 2\}\), size = 2 (incorrect, should be 3: {0, 1, 2}).

   - For \(n = 4\):
     - Coordinates: (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)
     - Distances: (similar analysis shows the set \(\mathcal{H}\) does not include 3, so the size is less than expected).

   - For larger \(n\), the pattern does not seem to cover all possible distances effectively.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
