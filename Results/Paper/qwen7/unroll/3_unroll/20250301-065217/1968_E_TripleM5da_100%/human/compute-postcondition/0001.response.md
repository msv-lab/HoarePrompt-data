Output State: The output consists of multiple lines. For each test case, it starts with two lines containing "1 1" and "1 2" respectively. Then, for each integer from 3 to n (inclusive), where n is the input for the current test case, there is a line containing that integer twice. The number of test cases is determined by the first input integer t, which is between 1 and 50 inclusive. Each n is between 2 and 1000 inclusive.
