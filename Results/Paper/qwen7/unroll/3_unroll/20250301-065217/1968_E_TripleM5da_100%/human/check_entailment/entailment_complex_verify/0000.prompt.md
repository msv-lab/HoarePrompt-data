You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/52d127e3dbe0141bb58dbdf4158586772a208758.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        print(1, 1)
        print(1, 2)
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            print(i, i)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        print(1, 1)
        
        print(1, 2)
        
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            print(i, i)
        
    #State: Output State: The output consists of multiple lines. For each test case, it starts with two lines printing "1 1" and "1 2". Then, for a number `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), it prints numbers from 3 to n, each on a new line, paired with themselves. The exact content depends on the value of `n` for each test case, but the structure remains the same for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and outputs a specific sequence of pairs. It first prints "1 1" and "1 2", followed by pairs of numbers from 3 to \( n \), each number paired with itself. If \( n \) is within the range 2 to \( 10^3 \), the function completes successfully; otherwise, it does not explicitly return anything different but stops processing for that test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, for \( n > 2 \), the program only prints two points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) and then a series of points \((i, i)\) from \(3\) to \(n\). This approach does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

For example, consider \( n = 3 \). The optimal arrangement, as described in the problem note, includes the points \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\). However, the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
```
This arrangement does not include the points \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\), resulting in a smaller set \(\mathcal{H}\).

Therefore, the program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \( n \geq 3 \), making it incorrect.
