Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to check if it follows the problem description and produces the expected output for various values of \( n \).

1. **Problem Description Compliance**:
   - The program should handle multiple test cases, each with an integer \( n \) where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^3 \).
   - For each test case, it should output \( n \) points that maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it prints the coordinates \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) as the first two points.
   - It then iterates from 3 to \( n \) and prints each number paired with itself, i.e., \((i, i)\).

3. **Verification of Output**:
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 2)\)
     - Distances: \(\{0, 1\}\)
     - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 2 (correct)
   - For \( n = 3 \):
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\)
     - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\)
     - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 4 (correct)
   - For \( n = 4 \):
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\)
     - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\)
     - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 5 (correct)
   - For \( n = 5 \):
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\)
     - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\)
     - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 6 (correct)
   - For \( n = 6 \):
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), \((6, 6)\)
     - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\)
     - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 7 (correct)

Given that the program correctly handles all test cases and produces the expected output, it adheres to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
