Output State: The output consists of multiple lines. For each test case, it starts with two lines printing "1 1" and "1 2". Then, for a number `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), it prints numbers from 3 to n, each on a new line, paired with themselves. The exact content depends on the value of `n` for each test case, but the structure remains the same for each test case.
