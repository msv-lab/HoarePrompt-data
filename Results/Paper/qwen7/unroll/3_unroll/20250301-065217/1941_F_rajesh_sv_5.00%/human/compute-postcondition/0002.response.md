Output State: `testcases` is the result of `func_3()`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. After executing the loop `testcases` times, for each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain the same integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m, k <= 2 * 10^5. The list `a` remains a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}. The list `d` remains a list of m integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^9. The list `f` remains a list of k integers such that 1 <= f_i <= 10^9. The variable `t` is decremented by 1 after the loop finishes all its iterations.
