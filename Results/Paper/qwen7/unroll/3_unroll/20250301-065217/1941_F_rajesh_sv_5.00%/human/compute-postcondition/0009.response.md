Output State: **`max_diff` is the largest difference found between consecutive elements in the list `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference found between consecutive elements in the list `A`, `index` is the index of the element where `max_diff` was found, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `max_diff` to the variable `ans`. No other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` retain their original values, and `ans` is now equal to `max_diff`.
