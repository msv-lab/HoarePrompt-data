Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) representing the length of a list, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns different outputs based on the conditions specified for each test case.**

This means the function takes in a set of test cases, each containing a value for t, n, and a list of n integers. It then processes these inputs according to the given constraints and returns appropriate results for each test case.
