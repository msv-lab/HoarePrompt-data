Output State: The output state will consist of 't' lines, each containing either 'Yes' or 'No'. For each iteration of the loop, if either 'a' or 'b' is even, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. Since the values of 'a' and 'b' are provided by user input during each iteration, the exact content of 'Yes' or 'No' for each line cannot be determined without knowing the specific inputs for each 'a' and 'b'.
