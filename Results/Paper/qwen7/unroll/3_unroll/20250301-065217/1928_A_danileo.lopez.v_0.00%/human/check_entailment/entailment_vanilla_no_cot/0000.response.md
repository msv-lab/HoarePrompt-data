Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle based on the problem description. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The program handles the edge case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd numbers. If both dimensions are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new distinct rectangle. Therefore, it prints 'No' in such cases.
   
2. **General Case Handling**: If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, the program correctly identifies that it is possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new distinct rectangle. Therefore, it prints 'Yes' in such cases.

The logic is sound and aligns with the problem statement. Thus, the given program is correct.
