Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases through its constraints. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters). The function processes these inputs and returns different outputs based on the given conditions.**

However, since the exact output logic is not specified, we can only describe the input parameters and their constraints.
