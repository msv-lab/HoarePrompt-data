Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), followed by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters). For each test case, it checks if string `c` can be formed by swapping characters between strings `a` and `b` at the same positions where `a` and `b` have matching characters. If such swaps are possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This process is repeated `t` times.**
