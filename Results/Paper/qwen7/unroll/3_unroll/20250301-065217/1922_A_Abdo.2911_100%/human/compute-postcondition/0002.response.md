Output State: The program will read `t` test cases. For each test case, it will read an integer `n`, a string `a`, a string `b`, and a string `c`. It will then check if it's possible to transform `c` into either `a` or `b` by changing one character at a time, where each change must match the corresponding character in either `a` or `b`. If such a transformation is possible, it prints 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The final output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the transformation possibility for each test case.
