Functionality: **The function interacts with a hidden permutation of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\) by making up to \(3n\) queries. It first identifies a candidate index `mak` through comparisons, then populates a list `pans` using further comparisons involving `mak2`. Finally, it refines `mak` by comparing elements within `pans` and outputs the pair `(mak2, mak)` as the result.**
