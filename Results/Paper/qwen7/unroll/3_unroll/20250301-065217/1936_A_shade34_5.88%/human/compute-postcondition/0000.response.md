Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop uses `_` as an iterator, but this is just a placeholder and doesn't provide any meaningful information about the state.
   - The key part of the loop is the call to `int(input())`, which reads an integer from the input. This integer will determine how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop will run for a number of iterations determined by the value read from input, we need to ensure that the input value is valid and non-negative.
   - We don't need to adjust the state of the permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) because the problem states that it is a hidden permutation and we cannot directly modify it. Our queries will help us understand its properties.
   - The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the state in a way that needs adjustment.

3. **Formulate the Final State:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that determines the number of iterations. Let's denote this value as `num_iterations`.
   - For the loop to execute, `num_iterations` must be a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that determines the number of iterations.

**State: **`num_iterations` must be a non-negative integer**
