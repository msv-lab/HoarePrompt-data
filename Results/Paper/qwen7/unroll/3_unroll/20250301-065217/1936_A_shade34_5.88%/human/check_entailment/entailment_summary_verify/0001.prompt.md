You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

- Function Summary: 
The function interacts with a hidden permutation of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\) by making up to \(3n\) queries. It first identifies a candidate index `mak` through comparisons, then populates a list `pans` using further comparisons involving `mak2`. Finally, it refines `mak` by comparing elements within `pans` and outputs the pair `(mak2, mak)` as the result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n`.

2. **Finding the Maximum OR Value:**
   - The program attempts to find the index `mak` such that `(p_mak | p_mak)` is the maximum possible value.
   - It iterates from `1` to `n-1` and compares `(p_mak | p_mak)` with `(p_i | p_i)` for each `i` from `1` to `n-1`.
   - If `(p_i | p_i) > (p_mak | p_mak)`, it updates `mak` to `i`.

3. **Finding Possible Candidates:**
   - After finding `mak`, the program initializes `mak2` to `mak`.
   - It then iterates through all indices `i` from `0` to `n-1` and compares `(p_mak | p_mak2)` with `(p_i | p_mak2)`.
   - If `(p_i | p_mak2) > (p_mak | p_mak2)`, it updates `mak2` to `i` and stores `i` in `pans`.
   - If `(p_i | p_mak2) == (p_mak | p_mak2)`, it appends `i` to `pans`.

4. **Refining the Candidates:**
   - The program then iterates through the candidates stored in `pans` and refines them by comparing `(p_mak2 | p_mak2)` with `(p_i | p_i)` for each candidate `i`.
   - If `(p_i | p_i) > (p_mak2 | p_mak2)`, it updates `mak2` to `i`.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - Finally, it prints the indices `mak2` and `mak` as the solution.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Approach for Finding Maximum OR Value:**
   - The program tries to find the maximum OR value by comparing `(p_mak | p_mak)` with `(p_i | p_i)`. This approach is flawed because it only considers the OR value of the same index, which is not useful for finding the maximum XOR value.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Candidates:**
   - The program stores indices in `pans` based on the OR comparison but does not ensure that these indices are valid for maximizing the XOR value. The refinement step also does not correctly handle the XOR values.

3. **Query Count:**
   - The program makes more than 3n queries, which violates the problem constraints.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem and exceeds the query limit. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
