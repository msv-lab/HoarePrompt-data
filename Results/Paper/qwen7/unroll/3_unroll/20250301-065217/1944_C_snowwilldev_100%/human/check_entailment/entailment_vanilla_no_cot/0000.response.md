Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. Here’s why:

1. **Game Logic Mismatch**: 
   - According to the problem, Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, whereas Bob can only pick from `a` and delete it without appending.
   - The current implementation does not simulate the turns correctly. It simply counts how many times each number appears in the array and returns the smallest number that does not appear in the count, which is not equivalent to simulating the game.

2. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**:
   - The optimal strategy involves both players making moves to ensure the MEX of `c` is maximized for Alice and minimized for Bob. The current code does not simulate these strategic choices.
   - Instead of counting occurrences, we need to simulate the turns where Alice and Bob make their optimal choices.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the turns and consider the optimal strategy for both players. Here’s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each number in a
    freq = Counter(a)
    
    # Alice's turn: pick unique elements
    alice_turns = []
    for i in range(N):
        if freq[i] > 0:
            alice_turns.append(i)
            freq[i] -= 1
    
    # Bob's turn: pick remaining elements
    bob_turns = []
    for i in range(N):
        if freq[i] > 0:
            bob_turns.append(i)
            freq[i] -= 1
    
    # Combine turns to form the final sequence c
    c = alice_turns + bob_turns
    
    # Calculate MEX
    mex = 0
    seen = set(c)
    while mex in seen:
        mex += 1
    
    return mex

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())
```

This approach correctly simulates the game by considering the optimal choices for both players and calculates the MEX of the resulting sequence `c`.
