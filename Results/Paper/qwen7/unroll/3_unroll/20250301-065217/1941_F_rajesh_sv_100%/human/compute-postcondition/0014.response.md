Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: n, m, and k, where n is a positive integer between 2 and 10^5, m and k are positive integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5. Additionally, A is a list of n strictly increasing integers, D is a list of unique integers, and F is a list of k positive integers. The function calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the list A and finds the minimum value among all possible differences between elements in D and adjusted values from F. Finally, it prints the larger of the maximum difference or the second-largest difference.**
