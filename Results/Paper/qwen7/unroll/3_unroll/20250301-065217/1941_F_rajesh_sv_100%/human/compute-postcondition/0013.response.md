Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: n, m, and k, where n is a positive integer between 2 and 10^5, m and k are positive integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5. Additionally, A is a list of n strictly increasing integers, D is a list of unique integers, and F is a list of k positive integers. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.**

Given the constraints and the nature of the parameters, it seems the function might be processing or comparing these lists, but without explicit return values stated, we can only describe the parameters accepted by the function.
