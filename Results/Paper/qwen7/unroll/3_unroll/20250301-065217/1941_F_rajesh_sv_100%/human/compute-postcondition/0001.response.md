State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0, `_` is not used in the loop and does not need adjustment**.

Explanation:
- The variable `_` is a placeholder typically used when an iterator is not needed in the loop body. It does not affect the loop's execution and thus does not need to be adjusted.
- The variable `testcases` determines whether the loop will execute. For the loop to run, `testcases` must be a positive integer greater than 0. Therefore, `testcases` must be greater than 0.
