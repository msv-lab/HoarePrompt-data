Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on predefined constraints. For each test case, given integers a, b, and c (where 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9), and an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), the function does not explicitly return a value but processes the input values according to the specified constraints.**

However, since the exact return value or processing logic is not detailed in the provided output cases, the functionality focuses on accepting the constraints for `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` without specifying the exact return value.
