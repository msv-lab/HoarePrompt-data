The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer provided by the user and ranges from 1 to 1000. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (each ranging from 0 to 9). Based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it prints one of three strings: 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
