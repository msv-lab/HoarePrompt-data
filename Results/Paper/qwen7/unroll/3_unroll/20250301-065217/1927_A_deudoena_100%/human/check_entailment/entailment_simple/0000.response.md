Reasoning:

1. The annotated program does not match the problem statement and the expected behavior. The problem requires finding the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white so that all cells become white. However, the provided code only considers the first and last black cells ('B') without checking the entire strip.

2. The logic in the function `func_1()` is flawed:
   - It calculates the position of the first black cell (`mi`) correctly but does not account for the possibility of multiple black cells in the middle of the strip.
   - It calculates the distance from the end of the string to the first black cell (`ma`) incorrectly. This calculation should consider the position of the last black cell, not just the first one.
   - The formula `return ma - mi + 2` is incorrect because it does not ensure the minimum segment length is returned. For example, if there are multiple black cells in the middle, the segment length should include all these cells.

3. The program should iterate through the string to find the longest sequence of consecutive white cells ('W') and then calculate the minimum segment length required to cover any remaining black cells.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, you would need to:
- Iterate through the string to find the longest sequence of consecutive white cells.
- Calculate the minimum segment length needed to cover any remaining black cells after the longest sequence of white cells.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    s = input()
    max_white_sequence = 0
    current_white_sequence = 0
    for j in s:
        if j == 'W':
            current_white_sequence += 1
        else:
            max_white_sequence = max(max_white_sequence, current_white_sequence)
            current_white_sequence = 0
    max_white_sequence = max(max_white_sequence, current_white_sequence)
    
    # Calculate the minimum segment length
    min_segment_length = len(s) - max_white_sequence
    return min_segment_length + 1
```

This corrected function properly identifies the longest sequence of consecutive white cells and calculates the minimum segment length required to cover any remaining black cells.
