Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `mi` and `ma`:**
   - The variable `mi` is supposed to store the index of the first occurrence of 'B' from the start of the string `s`.
   - The variable `ma` is supposed to store the index of the last occurrence of 'B' from the end of the string `s`.

2. **Misuse of `c` and `d`:**
   - The variable `c` is used to count characters until the first 'B' is encountered, but it should directly record the index of the first 'B'.
   - The variable `d` is used to count characters from the end until the last 'B' is encountered, but it should also directly record the index of the last 'B'.

3. **Adding 2 to the Result:**
   - The final calculation `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `ma - mi + 1` because the indices are zero-based, and we need the length of the segment, not the difference between indices plus two.

4. **Handling of Test Cases:**
   - The program uses a function `func_1()` that does not take any parameters, but it reads inputs inside the function, which is not consistent with the problem statement where the function should be called with the appropriate parameters.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white.

Correctness: **False**
