Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an optimal `k` such that the total revenue from selling `k` buns at a modified price and the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price is maximized.

2. **Binary Search Approach**: The provided code uses binary search to find the optimal `k`. However, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to maximize profit. Instead, it checks if the calculated profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which is not relevant to the problem.

3. **Correct Implementation**: To solve this problem correctly, we should directly calculate the profit for different values of `k` without using binary search. We need to iterate through possible values of `k` from 0 to `n` and compute the profit for each value, then select the maximum profit.

4. **Correct Code**:
   ```python
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       t = int(input())
       for _ in range(t):
           n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
           max_profit = 0
           for k in range(n + 1):
               profit = k * b + (n - k) * a
               max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
           print(max_profit)
   ```

5. **Analysis of Provided Code**:
   - The binary search approach is not suitable here because the relationship between `k` and the profit is linear and straightforward.
   - The function `func_1` is incorrectly checking if the profit is within a certain limit rather than calculating and comparing profits.

Given the above analysis, the provided code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
