Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `ans` is `k * b`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += k * b` increments the value of `ans` by the product of `k` and `b`. Since the initial value of `ans` is 0, after executing this line, `ans` will be updated to `k * b`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
