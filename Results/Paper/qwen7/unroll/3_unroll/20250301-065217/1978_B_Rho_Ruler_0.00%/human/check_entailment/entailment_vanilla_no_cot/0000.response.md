Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize Bob's profit. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Use of Binary Search**: 
   - The binary search is used to find `k`, but the condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)` in `func_1` is incorrect. This condition checks if the total revenue from selling `k` buns at the modified price and the rest at the usual price is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. However, this doesn't help in finding the maximum profit.

2. **Incorrect Profit Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the total revenue but does not consider the actual profit. The profit should be calculated as the total revenue minus the cost of producing the buns, which is not considered here.

3. **Logic to Maximize Profit**:
   - To maximize profit, we need to calculate the profit for different values of `k` and choose the one with the highest profit. The current implementation does not do this.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = 0
            for i in range(k):
                profit += (b - i)
            for i in range(k, n):
                profit += a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This solution iterates over all possible values of `k` and calculates the profit for each value, then selects the maximum profit.
