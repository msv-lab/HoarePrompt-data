Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. All other variables remain unchanged.**

This means that `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, and it is constrained to be between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`) remain in their initial state as described in the precondition.
