Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder variable) and the variable `t`. The variable `_` is used as a loop counter but doesn't affect the loop's execution directly. The key variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is assigned the value of an integer input from the user, and the input is guaranteed to be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the loop will always execute at least once.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop**: The initial state before the loop is given as `t` being assigned the value of an integer input such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This means `t` must be a positive integer.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer for the loop to execute. 

**Final State Adjustment**:
- The variable `t` must be a positive integer (since it is guaranteed to be between 1 and 10^4).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**.
