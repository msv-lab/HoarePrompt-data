Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each input iteration:
- n, m, and k are integers obtained from user input.
- a and b are lists of integers obtained from user input.
- len_a and len_b are the lengths of lists a and b respectively.
- count_a and count_b are initialized to 0.
- d is calculated as k // 2.
- The loop iterates up to the maximum length of lists a and b.
- count_a and count_b are incremented based on conditions involving elements of lists a and b and the value of k.
- 'YES' or 'NO' is printed based on the final values of count_a and count_b compared to d.
All other variables remain unchanged.
