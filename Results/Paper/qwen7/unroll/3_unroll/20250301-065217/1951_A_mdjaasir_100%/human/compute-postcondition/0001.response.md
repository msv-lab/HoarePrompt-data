State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be at least 1, `i` is 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
- Whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.
- Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0, as it is the starting index for the `range(t)` function.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` (must be at least 1) and `i` (should be 0).
