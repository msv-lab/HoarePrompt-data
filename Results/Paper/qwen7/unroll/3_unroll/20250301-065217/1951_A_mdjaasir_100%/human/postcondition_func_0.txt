The function reads multiple pairs of inputs, where each pair consists of an integer `n` and a binary string `a`. It then checks the number of '1's in the string `a`. Based on the count of '1's, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' for each pair. Specifically, if the count is 0, it prints 'YES'. If the count is greater than 2 and even, it also prints 'YES'. If the count is exactly 2, it checks if the second '1' is not immediately following the first '1'; if so, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. For all other cases, it prints 'NO'. After processing all input pairs, the function concludes with a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses corresponding to each input pair.
