Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the function signature. However, the problem description implies that the function should interact with an external entity to perform queries and receive responses. The interaction involves querying indices a, b, c, and d to compare bitwise OR results and finding indices i and j with maximum bitwise XOR.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    maxi = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            maxi = i
    arr = [0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            arr = [i]
        elif res == '=':
            arr.append(i)
    mini = arr[0]
    for item in arr[1:]:
        print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '>':
            mini = item
    print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
