Output State: **`wins` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The line `wins = 0` initializes the variable `wins` to 0. No other changes are made to the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`). Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
