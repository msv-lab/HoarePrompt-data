Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and the range function. Specifically, `i` is the loop variable that will take values from 1 to `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` equal to 1 (since the range function is `range(1, n + 1)`).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the states of the relevant variables**:
   - `i` should be set to 1 initially.
   - `n` should be such that the loop can execute, meaning `n` must be at least 1.

5. **Consider other variables**: The variables `t`, `q`, `a`, and `b` are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
