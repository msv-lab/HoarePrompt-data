Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` that starts with 0 and is followed by integers converted from the input. The input is expected to be a series of space-separated integers. The original values of `t`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged.
