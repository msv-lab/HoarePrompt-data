You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a set of test cases, each consisting of an array `a` of length `n`, and `q` queries. For each query, it determines whether the sum of elements in the subarray from index `x` to `y` (inclusive) in `a` is greater than or equal to the sum of elements in the subarray from index `x` to `y` in a derived array `b`. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results of the queries.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called properly within the main loop.
   - The main loop should call `func_1()` for each test case, but it currently calls `func_1()` once and then does nothing with the result.

2. **Accumulation and Calculation:**
   - The code calculates the prefix sums (`a`) and a modified prefix sum (`b`).
   - `a` is the prefix sum of the array `c`.
   - `b` is constructed such that `b[i]` represents a value derived from `a[i]`. Specifically, `b[i]` is calculated as `b[i-1] + x`, where `x` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than 1 or not.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - The program prints the prefix sums `a` but does not use them for further processing.
   - It then processes each query by comparing the difference between the prefix sums at indices `y` and `x-1` with the corresponding values in `b`.
   - If the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y` is met, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Function Call Issue:**
   - The main loop should call `func_1()` for each test case, but it only calls it once and does not process subsequent test cases.

2. **Logic for Determining Good Subarray:**
   - The logic used to determine if a subarray is good is flawed. The comparison `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` does not correctly reflect the conditions for a good subarray.
   - A subarray is good if there exists a permutation `b` such that the sum of elements in both arrays is equal, no element is the same, and all elements in `b` are positive. The current logic does not check these conditions properly.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The program prints "YES" or "NO" based on the comparison, which is incorrect due to the flawed logic.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is good. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
