Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). For each input list arr in test_cases, the function returns a list of integers where each integer represents the sum of counts of number pairs (r_x, r_y).**

This means the function processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes the size of an array, two specific numbers (x and y), and the array itself. The function then calculates and returns the sum of counts of specific number pairs (r_x, r_y) for each array in the test cases.
