Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). For each input list arr in the test_cases, it calculates the sum of counts of number pairs (r_x, r_y) for each element in arr, where r_x = -num % x and r_y = num % y. It then appends these sums to a results list and returns this list.**
