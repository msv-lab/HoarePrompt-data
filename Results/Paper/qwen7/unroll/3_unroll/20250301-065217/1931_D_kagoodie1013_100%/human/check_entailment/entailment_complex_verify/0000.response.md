### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`.
   - It then splits the input into tokens and parses the test cases.
   - This part of the code correctly handles the input format and ensures that each test case is processed correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a counter `count` and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the residues.
   - It then iterates over each element in the array `arr` and calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y` as specified.
   - The key insight here is that for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful, the conditions \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) and \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) must hold. These conditions can be simplified to checking the residues of the elements modulo `x` and `y`.
   - The program correctly uses the dictionary to count the occurrences of each pair of residues and adds these counts to the total count of beautiful pairs.

3. **Residue Calculation:**
   - The calculation of `r_x = -num % x` is equivalent to `r_x = (x - (num % x)) % x`. This ensures that `r_x` is always non-negative and less than `x`.
   - Similarly, `r_y = num % y` directly gives the residue of `num` modulo `y`.

4. **Output Generation:**
   - The function appends the count of beautiful pairs for each test case to the `results` list and returns it.
   - The output is generated by joining the results with newlines and printing them.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs based on the given conditions. The program processes each test case independently and returns the correct count of beautiful pairs for each case.

### Final Evaluation:

**Final: True**

The program is correct and accurately implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions.
