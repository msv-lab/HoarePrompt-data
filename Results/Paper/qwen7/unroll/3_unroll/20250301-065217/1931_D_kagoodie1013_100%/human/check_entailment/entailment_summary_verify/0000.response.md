### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to find the number of beautiful pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) in an array \(a\) such that:
  - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
  - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into tokens.
   - It then processes each test case individually.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the array \(arr\).
   - It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the occurrences of pairs of residues \((r_x, r_y)\).

3. **Calculating Residues:**
   - For each element `num` in the array, it calculates:
     - \(r_x = -num \% x\)
     - \(r_y = num \% y\)
   - It increments the count by the number of times the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) has been seen before.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current pair \((num \% x, num \% y)\).

4. **Returning Results:**
   - After processing all elements in the array, it appends the count to the results list.
   - Finally, it returns the results list.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` takes a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the array \(arr\).
- It processes each array independently and counts the number of beautiful pairs using the described method.
- It returns a list of counts for each test case.

#### Validation:
- The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs.
- The use of a dictionary to store residues ensures efficient counting.
- The program handles each test case independently and processes them correctly.
- The provided examples and the nature of the problem suggest that the program works as intended.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
