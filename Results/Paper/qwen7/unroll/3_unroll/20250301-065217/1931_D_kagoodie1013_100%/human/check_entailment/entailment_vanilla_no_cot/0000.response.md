Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case, and calculates the number of beautiful pairs using the `func_1` function. The solution uses a dictionary to keep track of the residues of array elements when divided by `x` and `y`, which helps in efficiently counting the pairs that satisfy the conditions. The implementation matches the problem description accurately.
