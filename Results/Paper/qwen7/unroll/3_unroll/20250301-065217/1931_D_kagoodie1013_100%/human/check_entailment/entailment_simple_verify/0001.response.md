### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Processing:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case individually. This part is accurate and follows the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the residues.
   - It iterates through each element in the array, calculating the residues modulo `x` and `y`.
   - For each element, it checks if there exists a previous element with the same residues, which would form a beautiful pair.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current element's residues.
   - Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs to the results list.

3. **Residue Calculation:**
   - The calculation of residues `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y` is correct. However, the use of `-num % x` might lead to confusion because it effectively calculates the remainder when `num` is divided by `x` but with a sign adjustment. This is mathematically equivalent to `x - (num % x)` if `num % x != 0`, but the direct use of `-num % x` is more straightforward.

4. **Dictionary Usage:**
   - The dictionary `residue_map` is used to count the occurrences of each unique pair of residues `(r_x, r_y)`. This ensures that the program correctly identifies and counts the pairs that meet the criteria for being beautiful.

5. **Final Results:**
   - The program correctly appends the count of beautiful pairs to the results list for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs as defined in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
