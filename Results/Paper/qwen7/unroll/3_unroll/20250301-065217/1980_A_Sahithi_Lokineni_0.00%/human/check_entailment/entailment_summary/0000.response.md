Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `defaultdict`:** The code initializes `d` using `default_value`, but `default_value` is not defined anywhere in the program. This will raise a `NameError`.

2. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Problems Needed:** The logic in the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed. Specifically, it assumes that each difficulty level must appear at least `m` times, which is incorrect. It should check how many times each difficulty level appears and calculate the shortfall only for those that do not meet the requirement for `m` rounds.

3. **Function `func_1`:** This function is not used in the main logic and does not affect the correctness directly, but it is an unnecessary part of the code.

Given these issues, the program will not produce the correct results for the provided examples or any other test cases.

Correctness: **False**
