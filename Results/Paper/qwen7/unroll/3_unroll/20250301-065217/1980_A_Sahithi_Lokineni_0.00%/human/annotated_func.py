#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5. The string a consists of n characters, each character is a letter from 'A' to 'G'.
def func_1():
    return 0
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and always returns 0.
