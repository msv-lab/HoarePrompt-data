Output State: **`moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an input integer, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, with each key in the range [1, n] having a value that is a list containing its adjacent keys from the input, and `leaves` is a deque containing all the keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have only one adjacent key.**

Explanation: The code `moves = func_1(nodes, start)` calls the function `func_1` with the arguments `nodes` and `start`. The function `func_1` is not defined here, so we cannot determine the exact value of `moves`. However, we know that `moves` is assigned the return value of `func_1(nodes, start)`. The other variables (`t`, `edges`, `start`, `empty`, `nodes`, and `leaves`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
