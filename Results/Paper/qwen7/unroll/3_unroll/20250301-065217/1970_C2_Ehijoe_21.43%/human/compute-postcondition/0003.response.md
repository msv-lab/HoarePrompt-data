Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `empty` is True, and `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list.**

The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `nodes` with the default factory set to `list`. This means that `nodes` is a dictionary where each key maps to a list by default. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
