Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `empty` is True, and `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, with each key representing a node (from 1 to n) and its value being a list of its adjacent nodes based on the inputs provided during the loop iterations.
