You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \(t\) and an integer \(x\). For each test case, it calculates \(y = x // 2\) and prints the value of \(y\). The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly find an integer \( y \) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. Instead, it simply sets \( y \) to be half of \( x \), which does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

For example, consider the input \( x = 10 \). The program outputs \( y = 5 \), but \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10\). However, if we choose \( y = 9 \), then \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 10\), which is the same value but might be a valid choice depending on the problem's requirements. More importantly, choosing \( y = 5 \) is not always optimal; for instance, if \( x = 100 \), the program outputs \( y = 50 \), but \(\gcd(100, 49) + 49 = 49 + 1 = 50\) could potentially be higher than \(\gcd(100, 50) + 50 = 50 + 50 = 100\), although in this specific case, 50 is still the correct answer.

Thus, the program does not guarantee finding the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for all inputs, making it incorrect.
