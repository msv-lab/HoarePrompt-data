Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
- The provided solution simply sets \( y = x // 2 \) and prints it. This approach does not guarantee that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
- For example, consider \( x = 10 \):
  - If \( y = 5 \), then \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7\).
  - However, if \( y = 9 \), then \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\), which is greater than 7.
- Therefore, the provided solution does not always produce the correct result because it does not account for the condition that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) should be maximized.

Correctness: **False**
