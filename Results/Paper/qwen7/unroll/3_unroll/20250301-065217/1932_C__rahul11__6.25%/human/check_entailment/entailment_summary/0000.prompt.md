Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Example

Input

    4
    
    4 6
    
    3 1 4 2
    
    LRRL
    
    5 1
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    LLLLL
    
    6 8
    
    1 2 3 4 5 6
    
    RLLLRR
    
    1 10000
    
    10000
    
    R

Output

    0 2 4 1 
    0 0 0 0 0 
    0 0 0 4 4 4 
    0 
    
Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

# Program:
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans *= i
        res[0] = ans % m % MOD
        c = 1
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                r -= 1
            c += 1
        print(*res)





# Execution Summary:
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \), another positive integer \( m \), an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers, and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) containing only 'L' and 'R'. For each test case, it calculates a sequence of values based on the initial product of the array elements and updates this product according to the directions in the string \( s \). Specifically, if a character in \( s \) is 'L', the product is divided by the current leftmost element in \( a \); if 'R', the product is divided by the current rightmost element in \( a \). Each update is taken modulo \( m \) and then modulo \( 1000000006 \). The function outputs a list \( res \) of length \( n \), where each element \( res[i] \) (for \( 1 \leq i < n \)) represents the product after the \( i \)-th update, and the first element \( res[0] \) is the initial product of all elements in \( a \) reduced modulo \( m \) and then modulo \( 1000000006 \).
