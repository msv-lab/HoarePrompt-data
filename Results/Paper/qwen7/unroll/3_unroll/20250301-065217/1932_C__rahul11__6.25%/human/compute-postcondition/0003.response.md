Output State: The output state consists of a list `res` of length `n`, where each element `res[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n-1) is calculated based on the initial product of elements in the array `arr` and then updated according to the direction specified in the string `s`. Specifically, for each character in `s`:

- If the character is 'L', the product is divided by the current leftmost element in `arr` and updated.
- If the character is 'R', the product is divided by the current rightmost element in `arr` and updated.

Each update is taken modulo `m` and then modulo `1000000006`. The first element of `res` (`res[0]`) is the initial product of all elements in `arr` reduced modulo `m` and then modulo `1000000006`.
