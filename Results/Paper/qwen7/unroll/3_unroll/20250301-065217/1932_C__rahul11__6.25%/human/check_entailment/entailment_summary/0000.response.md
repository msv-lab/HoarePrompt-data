Reasoning:
- The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
- The main issues are:
  1. The initial product calculation should be done using the elements of the array `arr` in the order they appear.
  2. The program incorrectly initializes the result list `res` with zeros and then overwrites these values, which does not match the expected output format.
  3. The program uses `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6` instead of the specified `m` for the final modulo operation, which is incorrect.
  4. The program does not handle the case where the product becomes zero after an early division, leading to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly follow the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
