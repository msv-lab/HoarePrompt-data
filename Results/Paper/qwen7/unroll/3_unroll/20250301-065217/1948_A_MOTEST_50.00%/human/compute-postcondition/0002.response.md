Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `s` is a string containing 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', os.system('cls') has been called.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. The initial state of `s` and the call to `os.system('cls')` remain unchanged.
