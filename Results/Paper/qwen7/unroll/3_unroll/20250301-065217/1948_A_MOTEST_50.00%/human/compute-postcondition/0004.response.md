Output State: **The console will display "NO" for each input value of `t` where the input value is 1, and "YES" followed by a string `ans` constructed based on the input value `n`. The string `ans` will be composed of characters from 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' according to the rules defined in the loop. Each iteration of the outer loop (`for i in range(t)`) will reset the variables `n`, `ans`, and `x` to their initial states.**

To break it down further:
- For each `i` in the range of `t`, the program will prompt for an integer input `n`.
- If `n` is 1, it will print "NO".
- If `n` is even, it will construct a string `ans` by repeating pairs of characters from 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' up to half of `n`.
- If `n` is odd, it will set `ans` to "AAA" (since `x` starts at 1 and we need to account for the middle character), then construct the rest of `ans` as described for even `n`.
- After constructing `ans`, it will print "YES" followed by `ans`.

The final state of the output will depend on the values of `t` and the inputs provided for each iteration of the outer loop.
