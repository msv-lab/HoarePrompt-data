The function processes a series of test cases (up to 50) where for each case, it takes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). If `n` is 1, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it constructs a string `ans` using characters from 'A' to 'Z' based on the value of `n` and prints "YES" followed by `ans`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but modifies the console output accordingly.
