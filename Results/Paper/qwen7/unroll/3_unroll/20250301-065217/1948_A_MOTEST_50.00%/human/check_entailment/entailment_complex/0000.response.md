Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the case when `n` is 1 by printing "NO".
2. For other values of `n`, the program constructs a string `ans` with special characters as per the problem statement.
3. The logic for constructing the string `ans` is as follows:
   - If `n` is even, it alternates between different characters from 'A' to 'Z' ensuring each character appears exactly twice consecutively.
   - If `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA' and then alternates similarly.
4. The program ensures that the constructed string has exactly `n` special characters, which is the requirement of the problem.
5. The program respects the constraints that `t` and `n` are within the specified ranges (1 ≤ t ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 50).
6. The program outputs "YES" followed by the constructed string or "NO" as required.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
