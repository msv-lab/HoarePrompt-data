Output State: The value of `t` positive integers `x` within the range 1 to 10^4 are processed. For each `x`, the binary representation of `x` is printed as a string of 30 characters ('0' or '1'). Then, the binary string undergoes a series of transformations based on specific rules, and the final length of the modified binary string along with the string itself is printed. The transformations include flipping certain bits and changing some '1's to '-1's under specific conditions. The exact output will depend on the input values of `x`, but it will always consist of a binary string of variable length (up to 31) followed by its length.
