Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a positive integer `x` (1 ≤ x < 2^30). For each test case, it returns either a specific value or an error message based on the relationship between `t` and `x`.**

Given the constraints and the implied nature of the function, it appears the function processes multiple test cases and for each, checks the condition involving `t` and `x`. However, since the exact return values or conditions are not specified, the general functionality can be described as above.
