State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, nalla is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `nalla` starts from 0 as specified by the `range(t)` function.
2. For the loop to execute, the value of `t` must be a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
3. The initial value of `nalla` is set to 0 before the loop starts.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` (to ensure it is a valid positive integer within the given range) and `nalla` (which is initialized to 0).
