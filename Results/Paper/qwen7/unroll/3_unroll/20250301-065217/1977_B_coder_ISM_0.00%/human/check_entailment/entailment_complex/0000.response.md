Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program correctly converts the integer `x` into a 30-bit binary string.
3. The program then modifies the binary string according to the specified rules:
   - It ensures no two consecutive non-zero bits (`1` or `-1`) exist.
   - It flips certain bits and converts some `1`s to `-1`s under specific conditions.
4. The program correctly handles the edge cases where the length of the binary string might increase.
5. The final output matches the required format: the length of the modified binary string followed by the modified binary string itself.

Given these points, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and produce the correct output for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
