### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, which happens when the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - The key observation is that Bob wins if and only if the XOR of all numbers in the sequence becomes zero after each removal by Eve.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit (1, 2, 3, 4) in the sequence is even.
   - Therefore, Eve should remove numbers to ensure that the count of each bit remains even, maximizing the number of times Bob wins.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it takes four integers `p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4` representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It calculates the number of times Bob can win using the formula: `sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3`.
   - The formula essentially counts how many pairs of numbers can be removed while keeping the counts even for each bit.

4. **Formula Explanation**:
   - `x // 2` gives the number of complete pairs of the current type of number.
   - `x % 2` gives the number of single instances of the current type of number.
   - `(i < 3)` ensures that 1s, 2s, and 3s are considered (4s do not affect the XOR result directly).
   - The sum of these values gives the total number of pairs that can be removed, and dividing by 3 gives the number of times Bob can win.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The formula correctly counts the number of times Bob can win by ensuring the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s remain even.
   - The division by 3 is correct because each pair removal reduces the count by 2, and we need to count the number of such pairs.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the provided formula and conditions.
