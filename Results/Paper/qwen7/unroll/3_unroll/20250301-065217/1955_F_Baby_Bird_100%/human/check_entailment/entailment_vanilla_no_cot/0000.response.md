Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The formula used in the program does not accurately reflect the strategy needed to maximize Bob's wins based on the optimal removal of numbers by Eve.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s, and how removing numbers affects the overall bitwise XOR result. Specifically, we should focus on maintaining the count of 1s and 3s, as they directly affect the XOR result, while 2s and 4s do not change the XOR result when removed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ones = p[0]
        twos = p[1]
        threes = p[2]
        fours = p[3]
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of Bob's wins
        bob_wins = min(ones, threes)
        remaining_ones = ones - bob_wins
        remaining_threes = threes - bob_wins
        
        # Remaining moves are all for Alice
        alice_wins = (remaining_ones + remaining_threes) // 2
        
        # Total wins for Bob is the initial number of Bob's wins plus the remaining moves Alice cannot win
        total_bob_wins = bob_wins + max(0, (remaining_ones + remaining_threes) % 2)
        
        print(total_bob_wins)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the optimal removal of numbers to maintain the condition for Bob's win.
