You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    #This is printed: a series of lines, each containing the computed value for each test case (where the value is computed as described above)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves determining the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally from a sequence of integers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4). Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers is non-zero, and Bob wins otherwise.

### Given Program
```python
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

2. **Expression Analysis**:
   - The expression inside the `sum` function is `(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3))`.
     - `x // 2` gives the integer division of `x` by 2.
     - `x % 2` gives the remainder of `x` when divided by 2.
     - `i < 3` is a boolean condition that evaluates to 1 if `i < 3` and 0 otherwise.
   - The expression simplifies as follows:
     - If `x` is even, `x // 2` is the number of pairs of elements, and `x % 2` is 0.
     - If `x` is odd, `x // 2` is the number of complete pairs, and `x % 2` is 1.
     - The term `x % 2 * (i < 3)` ensures that the last element (if `x` is odd) is considered only if `i` is less than 3.

3. **Summation**:
   - The sum of these values for each count of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s is computed.
   - The result is then divided by 3 and converted to a string before joining and printing.

### Correctness Check
- The expression `(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3))` does not directly relate to the problem of calculating the maximum number of Bob's wins.
- The logic of the expression does not align with the goal of determining the maximum number of Bob's wins based on the XOR condition.

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It appears to be a misinterpretation of the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
