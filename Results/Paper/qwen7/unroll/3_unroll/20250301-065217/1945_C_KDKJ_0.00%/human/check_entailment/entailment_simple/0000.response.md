### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and a string `a` as input.
   - It calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each position in the string `a` and stores these counts in a list `S`.
   - It then iterates through the string to find the optimal position `i` where the road should be placed. This position is chosen such that at least half of the residents on both sides of the road are satisfied.
   - The function prints the optimal position `i`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It ensures that the logic for each test case is executed correctly.

3. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The code defines some unnecessary variables and functions (`vector1`, `vector2`, etc.) which are not used in the main logic.
   - The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to solve the problem as described.
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The code correctly handles the constraints \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and the input format.
   - The logic for determining the optimal position `i` is sound and follows the problem statement.

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The provided example outputs match the expected results, indicating that the logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correctly implemented and follows the problem statement accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
