Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 Analysis**: 
   - This function calculates the number of pairs of identical integers in the list `a` using `Counter(a)`.
   - It then returns the minimum value between the number of such pairs and `n // 2`.
   - The logic here is sound because Nene will always try to minimize your score, and having pairs of identical integers means Nene can potentially score more points by playing those pairs against you. Therefore, the function correctly identifies the maximum number of points you can get by considering the worst-case scenario where Nene plays optimally to minimize your score.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1(n, a)` for each test case.
   - It correctly parses the input and handles multiple test cases efficiently.
   - The function then prints the results for each test case.
   - The overall structure and logic of the function are correct and align with the problem statement.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.
   - Function 1 correctly identifies the maximum number of points you can get by considering the worst-case scenario.
   - Function 2 correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
