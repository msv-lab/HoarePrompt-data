Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get in the described card game scenario. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of pairs of identical cards in your hand using the `Counter` from the `collections` module.
   - It then returns the minimum value between the number of such pairs and half the number of turns (`n // 2`). This is because Nene will try to minimize your score, and having more than `n // 2` pairs means she could potentially block all of them, leaving you with zero points.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input data from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the reading of multiple test cases and outputs the results for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the provided solution accurately computes the maximum number of points you can achieve under the optimal play of both you and Nene. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **True**.
