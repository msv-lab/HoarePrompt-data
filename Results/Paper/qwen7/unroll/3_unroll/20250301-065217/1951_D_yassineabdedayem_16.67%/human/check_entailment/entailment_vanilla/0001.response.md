### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice has `n` coins.
   - Bob wants Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each containing an unlimited amount of jewels.
   - Each stall has a price per jewel, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
   - Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next until she cannot afford any more jewels.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (coins) and `k` (jewels).
   - It initializes variables `rep` (number of stalls), `number` (current price), and `tab` (list of prices).

3. **Key Logic in the Code:**
   - The loop runs while `n` is not zero, `k` is greater than zero, and the number of stalls is less than 60.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the minimum (`Min`) and maximum (`Max`) possible prices for the current stall.
   - If `Max` equals `k` and the product of `n` and `Min` is less than or equal to `k`, it sets `number` to `Min` and decreases `k` by `Max`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `number` to `Max` and decreases `k` by `Min`.
   - It appends the current price to `tab` and updates `n` and `rep`.

4. **Checking the Output Conditions:**
   - If `k` becomes zero, it prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls and the list of prices.
   - If `k` is not zero after the loop, it prints "NO".

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic correctly handles the greedy buying process.
   - The code ensures that the number of stalls does not exceed 60.
   - The conditions for setting the prices are appropriate to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The output format matches the requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
