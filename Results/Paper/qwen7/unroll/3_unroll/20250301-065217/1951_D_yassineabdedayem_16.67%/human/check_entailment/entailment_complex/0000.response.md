Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n` (number of coins) and `k` (number of jewels).

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The program uses a while loop to simulate Alice's greedy behavior of buying jewels from the stalls.
   - It calculates the minimum and maximum possible number of jewels Alice can buy from the current stall (`Min` and `Max`).
   - Depending on the conditions, it updates the number of jewels Alice buys (`number`) and adjusts the remaining values of `n` and `k`.
   - It appends the number of jewels bought to the list `tab`.

3. **Termination Conditions**:
   - If `k` becomes zero, it means Alice has bought exactly `k` jewels, and the program prints "YES" along with the number of stalls used and the sequence of numbers.
   - If `n` becomes zero before `k` or if the number of iterations (`rep`) reaches 60, the program prints "NO".

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
