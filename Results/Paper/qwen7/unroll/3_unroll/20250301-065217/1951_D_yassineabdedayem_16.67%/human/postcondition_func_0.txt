The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers t, n, and k. For each test case, it repeatedly divides n by k using a specific strategy until either n becomes zero or 60 iterations are completed. If n becomes zero before k, it prints 'YES', the length of the operations performed, and the sequence of numbers used. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
