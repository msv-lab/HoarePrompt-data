Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N`, the array itself, and the number of queries `q`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It defines a function `func_1()` which is supposed to handle the processing for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads the array `nums` and initializes some variables like `s`, `e`, and `num`.
   - It creates an array `arr` where each element is a tuple `(start, end, value)` representing segments of the array with the same value.
   - It appends `-1` to `nums` to handle the last segment properly.
   - It iterates through the array to create these segments.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment in `arr` that starts within the query range `[l, r]`.
   - It checks the start and end of the found segment to determine if there are distinct elements within the query range.
   - Depending on the conditions, it prints the indices of the distinct elements or `-1 -1` if no such elements exist.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Segment Creation:**
   - The segment creation logic correctly identifies contiguous segments of the same value in the array.
   - This part is correct and ensures that we can efficiently check for distinct elements within any query range.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - The use of binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment is efficient.
   - The logic to check the start and end of the segment to determine if there are distinct elements is also correct.
   - The handling of edge cases (like when the segment starts exactly at `l` or ends before `r`) is appropriately managed.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like when the segment starts exactly at `l` or ends before `r` correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the segment does not contain any elements within the query range.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is sound and correctly implements the required functionality. The program efficiently processes each test case and handles queries as specified in the problem statement.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
