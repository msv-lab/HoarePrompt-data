Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` is an array (though its contents are not specified, it does not affect the `nums` list).
- `q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \([1, 10^6]\), followed by an additional element `-1`.
- `s` is equal to `n`.
- `e` is 0.
- `num` is the last element of the list `nums`, which is `-1`.
- `arr` is a list containing tuples of the form \((1 + s, i, num)\) for each change in consecutive elements in `nums` except the last one. Since `nums` ends with `-1`, there is no change detected at the end.
- `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
- `ppp` is 23 (though this variable is not relevant to the `print(nums)` statement).

The `print(nums)` statement will print the list `nums` as described above.

Output: **[1, 2, ..., n-1, n, -1]** (where each integer from 1 to n-1 and n is in the list, followed by -1)
