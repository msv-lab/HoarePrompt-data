Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `v` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0 except the first element which is 0 and the rest are converted from the input split and mapped to integers. `n` is not equal to 2.
