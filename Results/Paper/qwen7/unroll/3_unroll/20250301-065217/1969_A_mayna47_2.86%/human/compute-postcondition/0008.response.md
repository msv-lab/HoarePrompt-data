Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the range of `i`**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1` (exclusive), meaning `i` will take values from `1` to `n`.

3. **Check the initial state of `i`**: The problem does not specify the initial value of `i`, but since the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `n`, `i` should start at `1`.

4. **Consider the constraints on `n`**: The problem states that `2 ≤ n ≤ 50`. This means `n` must be within this range.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` starts at `1` and `n` is within the specified range `[2, 50]`.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` must be `1`.
- `n` must be within the range `[2, 50]`.

Since the other variables (`t`, `p`, `v`) are not involved in the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be between 2 and 50 inclusive**
