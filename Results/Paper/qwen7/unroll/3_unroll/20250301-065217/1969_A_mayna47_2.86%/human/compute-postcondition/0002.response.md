Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `v` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0 except the first element which is 0 and the rest are converted from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code updates the list `v` by setting its first element to 0 and the rest of the elements to the integers entered by the user. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `p`) remain unchanged. The length of `v` is `n+1` and all elements are initialized to 0 except for those converted from the input, which are integers.
