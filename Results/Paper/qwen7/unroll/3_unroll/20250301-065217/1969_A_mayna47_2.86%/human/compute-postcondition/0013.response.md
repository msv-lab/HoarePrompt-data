Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined by three values: t (an integer between 1 and 5000), n (an integer between 2 and 50), and p (a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n and not equal to its index). It does not return anything explicitly but implies processing or validation of these inputs.**

This means the function `func_1` is designed to validate or process a set of inputs where `t` is a count of test cases, `n` defines the size of the list `p`, and `p` itself is a list of unique integers within a specific range. The function does not return any value but presumably performs some operation or checks based on these inputs.
