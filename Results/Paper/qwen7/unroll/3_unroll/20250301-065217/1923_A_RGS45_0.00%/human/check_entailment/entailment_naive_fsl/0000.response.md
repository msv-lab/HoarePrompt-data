Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Specifically, the program only counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip positions but does not account for the actual minimum operations needed.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```

The program output is `1`, which is correct for this specific case. However, consider another case:
```
5
1 0 1 0 1
```

The correct output should be `2` because we need to move the chip in the 3rd position to the 2nd position, and then move the chip in the 5th position to the 4th position. But the program incorrectly outputs `0`.

Another example:
```
6
0 1 0 0 0 0
```

The correct output should be `1` because we can move the chip in the 2nd position to the 1st position. But the program incorrectly outputs `0`.

These examples show that the program does not handle all cases correctly, hence the correctness is **False**.
