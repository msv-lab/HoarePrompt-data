### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several issues with the program, particularly in how it handles even values of \( n \). Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step using the provided function summary and the example inputs to ensure the logic is correct.

#### Step-by-Step Re-Evaluation:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).

2. **Promotion vs Regular Price Calculation**:
   - The logic for handling odd \( n \) is correct:
     - If \( n \) is odd and \( 2a < b \), it prints \( a \times n \).
     - Otherwise, it prints \( \frac{n}{2} \times b + a \).
   - However, the logic for handling even \( n \) is flawed:
     - If \( n \) is even and \( 2a < b \), it prints \( a \times n \).
     - Otherwise, it prints \( \frac{n}{2} \times b \).

   This logic is incorrect because it fails to consider the possibility of using the promotion price for even \( n \) when \( 2a < b \). The correct approach should be to use the promotion price for as many pairs as possible and then add the remaining yogurts at the regular price.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the promotion price for two yogurts is cheaper than the regular price for one yogurt when \( n \) is even.

4. **Output**:
   - The program should output the minimum cost for each test case, but due to the incorrect logic, it produces incorrect results for some test cases.

#### Verification with Example Input:

Let's verify the program with the provided example input again:

- **Test Case 1**: \( n = 2 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)
  - Since \( n \) is even, it should check if \( 2a < b \). Here, \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) and \( 10 > 9 \), so it should use the promotion price.
  - Correct cost: \( 2 \times 9 = 18 \) (program outputs `9`).

- **Test Case 2**: \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)
  - Since \( n \) is odd, it should check if \( 2a < b \). Here, \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) and \( 10 > 9 \), so it should use the promotion price for two yogurts and the regular price for one.
  - Correct cost: \( 1 \times 5 + 1 \times 9 = 14 \) (program outputs `14`).

- **Test Case 3**: \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \)
  - Since \( n \) is odd, it should check if \( 2a < b \). Here, \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) and \( 10 < 11 \), so it should use the promotion price for two yogurts and the regular price for one.
  - Correct cost: \( 1 \times 5 + 1 \times 11 = 16 \) (program outputs `15`).

- **Test Case 4**: \( n = 4 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \)
  - Since \( n \) is even, it should check if \( 2a < b \). Here, \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) and \( 10 < 11 \), so it should use the promotion price for all yogurts.
  - Correct cost: \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) (program outputs `20`).

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly handles the case where the promotion price for two yogurts is cheaper than the regular price for one yogurt when \( n \) is even. The logic should allow for using the promotion price for as many pairs as possible and then adding the remaining yogurts at the regular price.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
