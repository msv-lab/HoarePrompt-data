Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the conditions: if \( n \) is odd and \( 2a < b \), it prints \( an \); if \( n \) is odd and \( 2a \geq b \), it prints \( \frac{n}{2}b + a \); if \( n \) is even and \( 2a < b \), it prints \( an \); otherwise, it prints \( \frac{n}{2}b \). The function does not return any value but outputs the calculated values for each test case.**
