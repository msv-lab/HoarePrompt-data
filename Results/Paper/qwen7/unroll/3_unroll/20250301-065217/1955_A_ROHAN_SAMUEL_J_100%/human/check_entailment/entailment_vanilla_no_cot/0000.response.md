Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a flaw in how it handles the case when `n` is even. Specifically, the logic for even `n` does not correctly account for the minimum cost when the promotion price for two yogurts (`b`) is less than twice the regular price (`2*a`). 

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2 == 1:  # If n is odd
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        else:  # If n is even
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b)

func()
```

This correction ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum cost for both odd and even values of `n`.
