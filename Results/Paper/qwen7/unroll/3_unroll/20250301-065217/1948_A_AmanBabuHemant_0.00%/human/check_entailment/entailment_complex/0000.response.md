Reasoning:
- The function correctly handles the input constraints for `t` and `n` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 50).
- For each test case, the function checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it correctly prints 'NO' because an odd `n` cannot form a string where every character is special (as defined in the problem statement).
- If `n` is even, the function generates a string `s` by repeating '110' `n//2` times. This ensures that the generated string has exactly `n` special characters, as each '1' in '110' is special (it is different from its neighbors).
- The function then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by `s`. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints 'NO'.
- The logic for generating the string `s` is correct and meets the requirement of having at most 200 characters.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided annotations.

Correctness: **True**
