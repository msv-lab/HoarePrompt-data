Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Special Character Definition**: The program does not correctly define what makes a character "special" according to the problem statement. A special character should be equal to exactly one of its neighbors, but the program generates strings with repeating patterns ('110') which do not necessarily meet this condition.

2. **Edge Cases**: The program fails to handle cases where `n` is odd. For odd `n`, the program prints 'NO', which is correct, but it should ensure that the generated string has exactly `n` special characters. However, the current approach does not guarantee this.

3. **Generating Special Characters**: The pattern '110' does not produce strings with the required properties. For example, in the string 'AAABAACC', characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are special because they are different from their neighbors. The pattern '110' does not consistently generate such special characters.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to generate a string where each character is special. One way to achieve this is by using a repeating pattern like 'AB' or 'AC' and adjusting as necessary to ensure the exact number of special characters.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Generate a string with exactly n special characters
            s = 'AB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This program will correctly generate a string with the required properties for even values of `n` and handle the case when `n` is odd by printing 'NO'.
