Functionality: **The function processes up to 50 test cases, each involving an integer `n`. For each `n`, it checks if `n` is odd or even. If `n` is odd, it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is even and the resulting string `s` (consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times) is less than 200 characters, it outputs 'YES' followed by `s`; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
