Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by positive integers \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), \( P_S \), a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \), and an array \( a \) of positive integers of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates two paths, one starting from \( P_B \) and the other from \( P_S \), and determines the maximum sum of \( k \) consecutive elements along each path. Based on the comparison of these sums, it prints either "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".**
