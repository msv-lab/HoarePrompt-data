Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input values for each test case.
2. It initializes the necessary variables and structures to store the paths and scores for Bodya and Sasha.
3. The program constructs the paths for both players by following the permutation rules.
4. It calculates the scores for both players using the constructed paths and the given array `a`.
5. The logic for calculating the scores seems correct, considering the constraints and the problem requirements.
6. The final comparison between the scores of Bodya and Sasha is done correctly, and the appropriate output is generated based on the comparison.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the correct logic and should produce the expected results based on the provided problem statement and examples.

Correctness: **True**
