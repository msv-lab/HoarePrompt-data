Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program initializes some constants (`YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, `alpha`).
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` (the lengths of the permutation, duration of the game, Bodya's starting position, and Sasha's starting position respectively).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Path Calculation for Bodya:**
   - A list `pathb` is initialized to store Bodya's scores.
   - A `vis` list is used to keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.
   - Starting from `pb - 1`, the program follows the permutation to calculate Bodya's scores until a cycle is detected.
   - The scores are stored in `pathb`.

3. **Path Calculation for Sasha:**
   - Similarly, a list `paths` is initialized to store Sasha's scores.
   - Another `vis` list is used to keep track of visited positions.
   - Starting from `ps - 1`, the program follows the permutation to calculate Sasha's scores until a cycle is detected.
   - The scores are stored in `paths`.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - Two variables `resb` and `ress` are initialized to store the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha respectively.
   - The program iterates through the calculated paths to compute the maximum possible scores for each player.
   - For each player, it calculates the score considering up to `k` turns and updates the maximum score accordingly.

5. **Result Output:**
   - Based on the computed scores, the program determines the winner or if it's a draw and prints the result.

### Correctness Check

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the input format and parses the necessary values.

2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The use of `vis` lists ensures that the program detects cycles and stops following the permutation once a cycle is detected, which is crucial for preventing infinite loops.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating the scores is correct. It considers the scores for each turn and updates the maximum score appropriately.

4. **Winner Determination:**
   - The program correctly compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and outputs the appropriate result.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is sound and correctly implements the rules of the game. There are no apparent errors in the code that would lead to incorrect results.

**Correctness: **True**
