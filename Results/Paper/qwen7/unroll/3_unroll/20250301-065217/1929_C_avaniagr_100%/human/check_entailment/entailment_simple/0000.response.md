Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the input from standard input (file-like object `0`). It iterates over each line after the first one, splitting each line into `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Conditions for 'YES' and 'NO'**:
   - If `x < k - 1`, the program checks if `a >= x + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
   - If `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 2`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
   - For all other cases (`x > k - 1`), it calculates `z` using a loop and checks if `a >= z`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

3. **Calculation of `z`**:
   - When `x > k - 1`, the variable `z` is initialized to `k - 2`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `x - k + 3` and updates `z` based on the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`. This formula is derived from the observation that the number of coins required to ensure a win increases exponentially with the number of consecutive losses.

4. **Strategy Analysis**:
   - The logic in the program matches the problem statement. Specifically, the conditions for 'YES' and 'NO' are correctly implemented based on the constraints and the strategy described in the problem.
   - The calculation of `z` ensures that Sasha can achieve any number of coins if he follows the described betting strategy.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins based on the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
