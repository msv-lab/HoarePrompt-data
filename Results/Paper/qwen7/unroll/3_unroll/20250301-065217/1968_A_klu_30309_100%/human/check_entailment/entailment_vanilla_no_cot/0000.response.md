Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \leq y < x \) and the sum of the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \) plus \( y \) is maximized. Here's a brief explanation:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and the values for each test case.
2. For each test case, it iterates backward from \( x-1 \) to 1 to find the value of \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
3. It uses the `math.gcd` function to compute the greatest common divisor.
4. If a higher sum is found, it updates the best \( y \) and breaks out of the loop to avoid unnecessary computations.
5. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

This approach ensures that the program finds a valid \( y \) for each \( x \) within the specified constraints and outputs the correct results as per the example provided.
