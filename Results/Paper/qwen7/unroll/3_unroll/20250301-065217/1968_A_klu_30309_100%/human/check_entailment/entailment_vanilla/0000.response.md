Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers from the input.
   - This part is correct.

2. **Function Call:**
   - The program calls `func_1(t, test_cases)` and prints the results returned by this function.
   - This part is correct.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of integers).
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - It iterates over each test case `x` and finds the value of `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`.
     - It initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
     - It iterates over all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 1.
     - For each `y`, it calculates the GCD with `x` using `math.gcd(x, y)`.
     - It calculates the sum `current_sum = gcd_val + y`.
     - If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to `y`, then breaks out of the loop.
     - After finding the best `y` for the current `x`, it appends `best_y` to `results`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function returns the list `results` containing the best `y` for each test case.
   - The main program then prints each element of `results`.

### Verification:

- The logic inside the function `func_1` correctly finds the value of `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` for each test case.
- The approach of iterating from `x-1` down to 1 ensures that the first `y` that gives the maximum sum is found and used.
- The use of `break` after updating `best_y` ensures that the first valid `y` is chosen, which is sufficient according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the value of `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
