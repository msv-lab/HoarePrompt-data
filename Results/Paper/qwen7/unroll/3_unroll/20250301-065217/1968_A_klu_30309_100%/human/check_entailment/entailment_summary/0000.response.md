Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and the values for each test case from the input.
2. The function `func_1` iterates over each test case and finds the value of `y` that maximizes the expression `gcd(x, y) + y` for each `x`.
3. The logic inside `func_1`:
   - Initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - Iterates over all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 1.
   - Computes the gcd of `x` and `y`.
   - Calculates the sum of the gcd and `y`.
   - If this sum is greater than the current `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to `y`, then breaks out of the loop to avoid unnecessary computations.
4. The function appends the `best_y` to the results list and returns it.
5. The main part of the program iterates over the results and prints each value.

Given the execution summary and the code analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and should produce the correct output based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
