### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \leq y < x \) and the value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized for each given \( x \).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - It then reads \( t \) integers \( x \) for each test case.
   - The function `func_1` is called with these values.
   - Inside `func_1`, it iterates over each \( x \) and finds the corresponding \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

3. **Key Logic in `func_1`**:
   - For each \( x \), it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - It then iterates over all possible \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 1.
   - For each \( y \), it calculates the GCD of \( x \) and \( y \).
   - It checks if the sum of the GCD and \( y \) is greater than the current `max_sum`.
   - If it is, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to \( y \). The loop breaks after finding the first such \( y \).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for each \( x \).
   - The loop starts from \( x-1 \) and goes down to 1, ensuring that the first \( y \) found is the largest possible \( y \) that meets the criteria.
   - The use of `break` ensures that once a suitable \( y \) is found, no further iterations are needed, making the solution efficient.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the required \( y \) for each \( x \).

**Correctness: True**
