Output State: **The program returns a list of integers where each element corresponds to the largest integer less than the respective x in test_cases such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and best_y plus best_y itself is maximized.**

This means that for each `x` in `test_cases`, the program finds the largest `best_y` (an integer less than `x`) that maximizes the sum of `gcd(x, best_y) + best_y`. The program then returns a list containing these `best_y` values in the same order as the corresponding `x` values in `test_cases`.
