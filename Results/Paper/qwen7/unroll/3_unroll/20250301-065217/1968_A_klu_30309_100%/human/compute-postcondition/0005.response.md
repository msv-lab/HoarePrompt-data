Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers each between 2 and 1000. For each element in `test_cases`, the function returns a list where each element is the largest integer less than the respective element in `test_cases` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the element in `test_cases` and the returned element plus the returned element itself is maximized.**
