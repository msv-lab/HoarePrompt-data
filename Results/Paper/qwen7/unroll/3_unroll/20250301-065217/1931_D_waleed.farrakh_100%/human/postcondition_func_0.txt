The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains the size of an array `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and an array `arr` of integers. For each test case, it calculates the count of unique pairs `(rx, ry)` that appear more than once in the array `arr`. Here, `rx` is computed as `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` as `a % y` for each element `a` in `arr`. The function returns a list of integers called `results`, where each integer corresponds to the count of such pairs for each test case.
