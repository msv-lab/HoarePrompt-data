Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

# Annotated Functions:

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x and y (two integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers), and arr (a list of n integers representing the elements of the array). Each element in arr is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        freq = {}
        
        count = 0
        
        for a in arr:
            rx = (-a % x + x) % x
            ry = a % y
            if (rx, ry) in freq:
                count += freq[rx, ry]
            current_pair = a % x, a % y
            if current_pair in freq:
                freq[current_pair] += 1
            else:
                freq[current_pair] = 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the value of `count` calculated for each corresponding test case in `test_cases`. For each test case, the value of `count` is determined by counting how many pairs `(rx, ry)` appear more than once during the iteration over the array `arr`, with `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers called 'results', where each integer represents the count of pairs (rx, ry) that appear more than once for each corresponding test case in 'test_cases'. For each test case, rx is calculated as (-a % x + x) % x and ry is calculated as a % y.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains the size of an array `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and an array `arr` of integers. For each test case, it calculates the count of unique pairs `(rx, ry)` that appear more than once in the array `arr`. Here, `rx` is computed as `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` as `a % y` for each element `a` in `arr`. The function returns a list of integers called `results`, where each integer corresponds to the count of such pairs for each test case.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n, x, and y are integers for each test case such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; arr is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each element a_i in the list, and the length of arr is n.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    t = int(data[0])
    test_cases = []
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))
        
        test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
        
        idx += 2
        
    #State: Output State: `test_cases` is a list containing tuples of the form (n, x, y, arr), where each tuple corresponds to the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` extracted from `data`. `idx` is `2 * t + 1`.
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The output state will be the same as the initial state because the loop only prints the results from the `results` list without modifying any variables. The `results` list is derived from `func_1(test_cases)` and remains unchanged during the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `n`, `x`, `y`, and an array `arr`. It then processes these test cases using `func_1` and prints the results. The function does not return any value but modifies no global state outside of its scope.
