### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the provided annotations and the original assessment.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: The `results` list is initialized to store the counts of beautiful pairs for each test case. The `freq` dictionary is used to keep track of the frequency of `(a % x, a % y)` pairs.
   - **Loop through the array**: For each element `a` in the array `arr`, the following steps are performed:
     - Compute `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`. This ensures that `rx` is always non-negative.
     - If the tuple `(rx, ry)` already exists in the `freq` dictionary, increment the count by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`.
     - Update the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in the `freq` dictionary.
   - **Return the results**: After processing all elements in the array, the count of beautiful pairs is appended to the `results` list.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input using `sys.stdin.read` and split into lines.
   - **Processing Test Cases**: For each test case, the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` are extracted and stored in the `test_cases` list.
   - **Calling `func_1`**: The `func_1` function is called with the `test_cases` list, and the results are stored in the `results` list.
   - **Printing Results**: The results are printed one by one.

### Correctness Verification

1. **Remainder Calculation**:
   - The expression `(-a % x + x) % x` correctly handles negative remainders, ensuring `rx` is always non-negative. This is crucial for correctly identifying pairs that satisfy the condition `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.

2. **Pair Counting**:
   - The logic for counting pairs is correct. By using the frequency dictionary, the program efficiently counts the number of pairs `(rx, ry)` that meet the criteria for being beautiful pairs.

3. **Frequency Dictionary**:
   - The use of a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of pairs is appropriate and efficient. This ensures that the program can handle large arrays and multiple test cases effectively.

4. **Input Reading**:
   - The input reading mechanism in `func_2` is correct and handles the large input sizes efficiently. The program reads the entire input at once, which is optimal for this problem.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic in both functions is sound and follows the problem statement accurately. The program correctly identifies and counts the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, we can conclude that it correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array according to the given problem description. The annotations and the original assessment accurately reflect the correctness of the program.
