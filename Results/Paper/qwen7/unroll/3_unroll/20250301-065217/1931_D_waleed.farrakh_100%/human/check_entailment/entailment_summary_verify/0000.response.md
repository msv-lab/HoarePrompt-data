### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `freq` is a dictionary used to store the frequency of `(rx, ry)` pairs.
   - `count` keeps track of the number of beautiful pairs found.

2. **Iterating Through Array**:
   - For each element `a` in the array, compute `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`.
   - These computations ensure that `rx` and `ry` are non-negative and within the range `[0, x-1]` and `[0, y-1]`, respectively.

3. **Checking and Updating Frequency Dictionary**:
   - If the `(rx, ry)` pair is already in the frequency dictionary, increment the `count` by the frequency of that pair.
   - Update the frequency dictionary with the current `(rx, ry)` pair.

4. **Returning Results**:
   - Append the `count` to the results list and return the results list after processing all elements.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - Each test case consists of `n`, `x`, `y`, and an array `arr`.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case and appends the results to a list.

3. **Printing Results**:
   - Prints the results for each test case.

### Verification of Logic:
- **Remainder Calculations**: The use of `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is always non-negative.
- **Frequency Dictionary**: Efficiently tracks pairs and their occurrences.
- **Pair Checking**: Correctly checks if a pair is beautiful by ensuring both conditions are met.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty Array**: The program should handle an empty array gracefully. However, since the problem guarantees that `n >= 2`, this case is not relevant here.
- **Large Inputs**: The program should handle large inputs efficiently due to the use of dictionaries and the fact that it only stores unique `(rx, ry)` pairs.

### Conclusion:
Given the detailed analysis and the provided function summaries, the program correctly implements the logic to find beautiful pairs in the array. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the given problem description, function summaries, and logical analysis.
