Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers for each test case such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each element a_i in the list, and the length of `arr` is n; `input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`**.

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or `arr`. Instead, it reassigns the variable `input` to refer to the function `sys.stdin.read`, which reads an entire stream from standard input as a single string. All other variables and their constraints remain the same as the initial state.
