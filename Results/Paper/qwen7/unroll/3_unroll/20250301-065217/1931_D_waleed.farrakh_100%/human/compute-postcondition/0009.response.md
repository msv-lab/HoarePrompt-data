Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The only object being iterated over here is `result`, and the iterable is `results`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. The variable `idx` and `test_cases` are not directly involved in the loop itself, so they don't need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

3. **State the adjusted state**: Based on the above reasoning, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `results` to ensure it contains at least one element.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`results` must contain at least one element**
