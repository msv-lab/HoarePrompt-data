Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing tuples of the form (n, x, y, arr), where each tuple corresponds to the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` extracted from `data`. `idx` is `2 * t + 1`, and `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`**.

Explanation: The code `results = func_1(test_cases)` calls the function `func_1` with the argument `test_cases` and assigns the return value of `func_1` to the variable `results`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `results`. However, we know that `results` now holds the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
