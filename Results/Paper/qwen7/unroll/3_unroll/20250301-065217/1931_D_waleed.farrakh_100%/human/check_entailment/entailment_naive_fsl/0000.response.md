Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find beautiful pairs in the array. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function iterates through each element in the array and calculates the remainders when divided by `x` and `y`. It uses these remainders to check for beautiful pairs efficiently using a frequency dictionary.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It then prints the results.

Let's verify the logic:
- For each element `a` in the array, calculate `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`.
- Use a frequency dictionary to keep track of how many times each `(rx, ry)` pair has been seen.
- For each element, check if the `(rx, ry)` pair has already been seen in the frequency dictionary. If so, increment the count of beautiful pairs.
- Update the frequency dictionary with the current `(rx, ry)` pair.

This approach ensures that all pairs are checked efficiently without redundant calculations. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this implementation handles all potential cases correctly.

Since no specific edge cases or inputs were provided that would cause the program to fail, and the logic appears sound, the program is correct.
