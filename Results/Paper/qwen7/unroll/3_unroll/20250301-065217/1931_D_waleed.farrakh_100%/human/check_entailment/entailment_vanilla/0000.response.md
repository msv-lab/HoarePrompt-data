Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `freq` is a dictionary used to store the frequency of `(a % x, a % y)` pairs.
   - `count` is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, compute `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`: This computes the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`. The expression ensures that `rx` is always non-negative.
     - `ry = a % y`: This computes the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - Check if the tuple `(rx, ry)` exists in the `freq` dictionary:
     - If it exists, add the value of `freq[rx, ry]` to `count`.
   - Update the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in the `freq` dictionary.

3. **Return the results**:
   - Append the final `count` to the `results` list and return it.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Reads the entire input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - Splits the input into lines.
   - Extracts the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - Iterates over each test case, extracting `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - Appends the test case to the `test_cases` list in the format `(n, x, y, arr)`.

3. **Calling `func_1`**:
   - Calls `func_1` with the `test_cases` list and stores the results.

4. **Printing Results**:
   - Iterates over the results and prints each one.

### Correctness Verification

1. **Remainder Calculation**:
   - The calculation `(-a % x + x) % x` correctly handles negative remainders, ensuring `rx` is always non-negative.

2. **Pair Counting**:
   - The logic for counting pairs is correct. It checks if the required conditions for a beautiful pair are met by leveraging the remainders.

3. **Frequency Dictionary**:
   - The use of a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of pairs is appropriate and efficient.

4. **Input Reading**:
   - The input reading mechanism in `func_2` is correct and handles the large input sizes efficiently.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic in both functions is sound and follows the problem statement accurately.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, we can conclude that it correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array according to the given problem description.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
