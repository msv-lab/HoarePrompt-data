Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `n`, `x`, `y`, and an array `arr`. It then processes these test cases using `func_1` and prints the results. The function does not return any value but modifies no global state outside of its scope.**
