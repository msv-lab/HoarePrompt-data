Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given solution does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Initial Calculation of Triangles**:
   - The initial calculation `ans = x + y - 2` is incorrect. This formula assumes that every additional vertex (both chosen by Bessie and by you) can form a new triangle, which is not always true due to the constraints of forming non-intersecting diagonals.

2. **Handling Gaps Between Chosen Vertices**:
   - The logic to check gaps between consecutive chosen vertices (`if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`) and adding one triangle per gap is flawed. It does not account for the fact that choosing a vertex might not always allow forming an additional triangle without intersecting existing ones.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The logic to handle the edge case where the first and last chosen vertices form a gap of 2 (`if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`) is also incorrect. It should consider whether the gap can be split into smaller parts to form additional triangles.

4. **Sorting and Iterating Over Gaps**:
   - The sorting of gaps and iterating over them to maximize the number of triangles is not correctly implemented. The logic to subtract `i - 1` from `y` and add `i` to `ans` does not always yield the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final calculation `ans += y` and `print(min(ans, n - 2))` is incorrect because it does not ensure that the triangles formed are non-intersecting.

To correctly solve this problem, a more complex algorithm is needed to ensure that the chosen vertices and additional vertices form non-intersecting triangles. This involves dynamic programming or a more sophisticated graph-based approach to maximize the number of triangles while respecting the constraints.
