Output State: `tt` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4. For each `ii` in the range of `tt`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from user input, and `a` is a list of integers also obtained from user input. After processing through the loop, `ans` is calculated based on the given logic and printed as the minimum of `ans` and `n-2`. The final value of `ans` after all iterations is printed.
