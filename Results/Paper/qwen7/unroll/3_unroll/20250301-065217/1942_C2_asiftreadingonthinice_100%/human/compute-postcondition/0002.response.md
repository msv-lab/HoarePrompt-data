Output State: `tt` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4. For each value of `ii` in the range `tt`, the following operations are performed:
- Read two integers `n` and `x`, then read a list of `n` integers into `a`.
- Sort the list `a`.
- Initialize `ans` to `x + y - 2`.
- Create an empty list `tmp`.
- Iterate through the sorted list `a` from index 1 to the end:
  - If the difference between consecutive elements is 2, increment `ans` by 1.
  - If the difference is even, append half of it to `tmp`.
- Check the difference between the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a`:
  - If the difference is 2, increment `ans` by 1.
  - If the difference is even, append half of it to `tmp`.
- Sort `tmp`.
- Iterate through `tmp`:
  - If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, add `i` to `ans` and decrease `y` by `i - 1`.
  - Otherwise, break out of the loop.
- Add `y` to `ans`.
- Print the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`.

After all iterations of the loop, the final value of `tt` remains unchanged, and the output state is determined by the values of `ans` for each iteration, with the final result being the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2` for each iteration.
