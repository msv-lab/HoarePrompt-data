Output State: **`tt` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4. All other variables retain their initial conditions.**

This means that `tt` now holds the number of test cases, and we are ready to process each test case according to the given conditions. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` for each test case will be read subsequently, but they are not yet defined in this state.
