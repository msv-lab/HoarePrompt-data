### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the initial configuration of stone piles. The key observation is that the game state can be simplified using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum is zero, the second player has a winning strategy; otherwise, the first player has a winning strategy.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function aims to transform the list of pile sizes into a new list where each element is the difference between consecutive elements after removing duplicates and sorting.
   - However, this transformation is not necessary for solving the problem correctly. Instead, we should directly compute the Nim-sum of the pile sizes.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function attempts to recursively determine the winner based on the number of piles and the sizes of the piles.
   - It uses a recursive approach to simulate the game states but does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the Nim-sum.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Compute the Nim-sum of the pile sizes.
   - If the Nim-sum is zero, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

5. **Implementation Check**:
   - The provided functions do not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the Nim-sum.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to solving the problem as stated.

6. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code shows that `func_1` and `func_2` are not used correctly. `func_1` does not contribute to the solution, and `func_2` does not implement the correct logic.
   - The main part of the code correctly computes the Nim-sum and uses it to determine the winner, which aligns with the correct approach.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate. The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not use the correct logic (Nim-sum) to determine the winner. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
