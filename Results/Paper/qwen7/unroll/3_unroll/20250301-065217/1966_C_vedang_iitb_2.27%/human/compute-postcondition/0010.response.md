Postcondition: **`a` is a list of n non-negative integers representing the initial number of stones in each of the n piles, where n is a positive integer greater than 1 but not equal to 2, `winNext` is the return value of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`. The condition `(winNext == 2 or (winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1))` is true.**
