Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to be related to the game logic at all. Specifically:

- `func_1` appears to be a function that processes an array by sorting, removing duplicates, and performing some arithmetic operations. This function does not relate to the game rules.
- `func_2` seems to be a recursive function, but its logic does not match the game rules. It does not take into account the smallest nonempty pile and the removal of a positive integer `k` from each nonempty pile. Instead, it seems to be checking for some conditions that do not align with the game's rules.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Determine the smallest nonempty pile.
2. Remove `k` stones from each nonempty pile, where `k` is the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
3. Recursively check who would win based on the new state of the piles.
4. Return "Alice" or "Bob" based on the outcome.

Since the provided code does not implement these steps, it fails to meet the problem description for every potential case.
