### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It prints `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` as two of the points.
   - If `n` is 3, it prints `(2, 3)`. Otherwise, it prints `(2, 4)`.
   - For values of `j` from 4 to `n`, it prints `(j, j)`.

3. **Checking the Output for Different Values of `n`**:
   - For `n = 2`:
     - Output: `1 1`, `1 2`
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: `{0, 1}`
     - This is correct as the maximum set size is 2.
   - For `n = 3`:
     - Output: `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 3`
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: `{0, 1, 2, 3}`
     - This is correct as the maximum set size is 4.
   - For `n = 4`:
     - Output: `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 4`, `4 4`, `4 5`
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`
     - This is correct as the maximum set size is 5.
   - For `n = 5`:
     - Output: `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 4`, `4 4`, `4 6`
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
     - This is correct as the maximum set size is 6.
   - For `n = 6`:
     - Output: `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 4`, `4 4`, `4 7`
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`
     - This is correct as the maximum set size is 7.

4. **Special Case Analysis**:
   - The solution handles the special case for `n = 3` by printing `(2, 3)`.
   - For other values of `n`, it prints `(2, 4)` and then prints `(j, j)` for `j` from 4 to `n`.

5. **Generalization**:
   - The solution generalizes well for larger values of `n` by ensuring that the Manhattan distances cover the full range from 0 to \( n-1 \).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution correctly outputs the required points for different values of `n` to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.
   - The logic handles the special case for `n = 3` and generalizes for other values of `n`.

However, upon closer inspection, the solution does not always produce the optimal set of points for all values of `n`. Specifically, for `n = 4`, the output does not achieve the maximum set size of 5. Instead, it achieves a set size of 5, which is correct but not the optimal solution for `n = 4`.

### Optimal Solution for `n = 4`:
For `n = 4`, the optimal set of points to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances is:
```
1 1
1 3
4 3
4 4
```
This produces the set of distinct Manhattan distances: `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly states that the provided solution is correct for all values of `n`. While the solution works for some values of `n`, it does not always produce the optimal set of points for maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
