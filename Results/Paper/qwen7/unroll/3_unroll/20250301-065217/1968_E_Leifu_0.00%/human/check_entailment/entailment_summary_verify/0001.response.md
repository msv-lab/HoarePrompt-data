Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to place `n` cells in an `n x n` grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It prints `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` as two of the points.
   - If `n` is 3, it prints `(2, 3)`. Otherwise, it prints `(2, 4)`.
   - For values of `j` from 4 to `n`, it prints `(j, j)`.

3. **Checking the Output for Different Values of `n`**:
   - For `n = 2`:
     - Output: `1 1`, `1 2`
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: `{0, 1}`
     - This is correct as the maximum set size is 2.
   - For `n = 3`:
     - Output: `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 3`
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: `{0, 1, 2, 3}`
     - This is correct as the maximum set size is 4.
   - For `n = 4`:
     - Output: `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 4`, `4 4`, `4 5`
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`
     - This is correct as the maximum set size is 5.
   - For `n = 5`:
     - Output: `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 4`, `4 4`, `4 6`
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
     - This is correct as the maximum set size is 6.
   - For `n = 6`:
     - Output: `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 4`, `4 4`, `4 7`
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`
     - This is correct as the maximum set size is 7.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the solution does not always produce the maximum set of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of `n`. Specifically, for `n > 4`, the solution only prints points from `(1, 1)` to `(4, 4)` and then continues with points from `(4, 5)` to `(n, n)`. This approach does not necessarily maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances for larger values of `n`.

For example, consider `n = 5`:
- The output is `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 4`, `4 4`, `4 6`.
- The distinct Manhattan distances are `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.
- However, a better configuration could be `1 1`, `1 2`, `1 3`, `4 1`, `5 5`, which gives the distinct Manhattan distances `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`.

Similarly, for `n = 6`:
- The output is `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 4`, `4 4`, `4 7`.
- The distinct Manhattan distances are `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`.
- A better configuration could be `1 1`, `1 2`, `1 3`, `4 1`, `5 5`, `6 6`, which gives the distinct Manhattan distances `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`.

Therefore, the provided solution does not always produce the maximum set of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of `n`.

Final: **False**
