Output State: t lines of output where each line contains '1 1' followed by '1 2', then either '2 3' or '2 4' depending on whether the input n was 3, and finally a sequence of lines from '4' to the input value of n, each line formatted as '<number> <number>'. The exact content of each line depends on the input value of n for that iteration.
