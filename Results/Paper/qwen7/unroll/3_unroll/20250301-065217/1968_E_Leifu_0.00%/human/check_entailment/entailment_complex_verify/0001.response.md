### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to place `n` cells in an `n x n` grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The goal is to output a configuration of points that maximizes the number of unique Manhattan distances.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It prints `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` as two of the points.
   - If `n` is 3, it prints `(2, 3)`. Otherwise, it prints `(2, 4)`.
   - For values of `j` from 4 to `n`, it prints `(j, j)`.

3. **Checking the Output for Different Values of `n`**:
   - For `n = 2`:
     - Output: `1 1`, `1 2`
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: `{0, 1}`
     - This is correct as the maximum set size is 2.
   - For `n = 3`:
     - Output: `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 3`
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: `{0, 1, 2, 3}`
     - This is correct as the maximum set size is 4.
   - For `n = 4`:
     - Output: `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 4`, `4 4`, `4 5`
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`
     - This is correct as the maximum set size is 5.
   - For `n = 5`:
     - Output: `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 4`, `4 4`, `4 6`
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
     - This is correct as the maximum set size is 6.
   - For `n = 6`:
     - Output: `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 4`, `4 4`, `4 7`
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`
     - This is correct as the maximum set size is 7.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution correctly outputs the required points for different values of `n` to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.
   - However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the solution does not always produce the maximum set of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of `n`.

   - For example, consider `n = 4`:
     - The output is `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 4`, `4 4`, `4 5`.
     - The distinct Manhattan distances are `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.
     - A better configuration could be `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 3`, `3 4`, `4 1`, which gives the set of distinct Manhattan distances `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.

   - Similarly, for `n = 5`:
     - The output is `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 4`, `4 4`, `4 6`.
     - The distinct Manhattan distances are `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.
     - A better configuration could be `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 3`, `3 4`, `4 5`, which gives the set of distinct Manhattan distances `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`.

   - Therefore, the provided solution does not always maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided solution does not always produce the maximum set of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of `n`.
