Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) which consists of distinct Manhattan distances between pairs of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The provided code attempts to generate a specific set of points for each \(n\).
3. For \(n = 2\), the code prints:
   ```
   1 1
   1 2
   ```
   This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which is correct.
4. For \(n = 3\), the code prints:
   ```
   1 1
   1 2
   2 3
   ```
   This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), which is correct.
5. For \(n = 4\), the code prints:
   ```
   1 1
   1 2
   2 4
   4 4
   4 5
   4 6
   4 7
   ```
   This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), but the optimal set should include all distances from 0 to 6, which can be achieved by placing points at \((1,1)\), \((1,2)\), \((2,1)\), \((2,3)\), \((3,1)\), \((3,4)\), and \((4,4)\). The provided solution does not cover all distances.
6. For \(n = 5\), the code prints:
   ```
   1 1
   1 2
   2 4
   4 4
   4 5
   4 6
   4 7
   5 5
   ```
   This results in a similar issue as for \(n = 4\), missing some distances.
7. For \(n = 6\), the code prints:
   ```
   1 1
   1 2
   2 4
   4 4
   4 5
   4 6
   4 7
   5 2
   5 5
   6 1
   ```
   Again, this does not cover all possible distances.

Given these observations, the provided code does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\).

Correctness: **False**
