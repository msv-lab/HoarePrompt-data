The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 40` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 2n`. It calculates the number of cliques (`cliques`) as `ceil(n / k)`. The function then fills an array `arr` of length `n` with values based on the calculated number of cliques and the range defined by `k`. Specifically, for each clique `i`, it sets elements in `arr` from index `i * k` to the minimum of `(i + 1) * k - 1` and `n - 1` to the value `i + 1`. After filling the array, the function prints the array, the number of cliques, and an array of `n` zeros.
