Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(mid)`. This means the loop will execute from `i = 0` to `i = mid - 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0.

3. **Determine the Value of `mid`**: The value of `mid` is given as `(big_element - small_element) // 2`. We need to ensure that `mid` is a positive integer, otherwise the loop won't execute.

4. **Initial Values of Other Variables**: The other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `not_mid`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and don't need to be adjusted unless they affect the value of `mid`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0 and `mid` is a positive integer.

**State:**
- `i` is 0
- `mid` must be a positive integer (i.e., `mid > 0`)

So, the final state should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `mid` must be a positive integer**
