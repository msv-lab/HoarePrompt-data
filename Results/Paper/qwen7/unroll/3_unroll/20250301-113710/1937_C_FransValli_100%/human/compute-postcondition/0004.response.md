Functionality: The function accepts no explicit parameters and reads the size of a secret permutation \( n \) from standard input. It then performs a series of up to \( 3n \) queries to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) in the permutation such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized. After identifying these indices, it outputs the values of \( i \) and \( j \) to standard output.
