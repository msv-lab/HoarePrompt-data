This is an interactive problem with no explicit input variables defined in the function signature. The problem involves finding two indices i and j in a secret permutation p such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized using at most 3n queries. The permutation p is a sequence of unique integers from 0 to n-1, and n is an integer such that 2 \leq n \leq 10^4.
