Reasoning:
- The problem requires constructing a string with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- The annotated program checks if `n` is odd. If it is, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each character is compared to its neighbors.
- If `n` is even, the program constructs a string using the pattern '110' repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that every third character is different from its neighbors, making them special.
- The constructed string is truncated to a maximum length of 200 characters if necessary.
- The logic correctly handles all given constraints and examples. For instance, when `n` is 6, the string 'AAABAACC' is generated, which has 6 special characters as required. When `n` is 1 or 2, it correctly outputs 'NO' since it's not possible to have an odd number of special characters or to meet the requirement with a string of length at most 200.

Correctness: **True**
