You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` test cases are processed. For each test case:
    #- If the given integer `n` is odd, the output is 'NO'.
    #- If the given integer `n` is even and less than 400, the output is 'YES' followed by a string consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times, but truncated to 200 characters if necessary.
    #- If the given integer `n` is even but greater than or equal to 400, the output is 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 50 test cases, each involving an integer `n`. For each test case, if `n` is odd, it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is even and less than 400, it outputs 'YES' followed by a string consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times, truncated to 200 characters if necessary. If `n` is even and 400 or greater, it outputs 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly generate a string with exactly `n` special characters as described. Specifically, the string generation logic `'110' * (n // 2)` does not ensure that each character is special according to the definition provided. For example, if `n = 2`, the generated string would be `'110'`, which has only one special character ('1'), not two. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `n` is odd, which is explicitly stated as a valid scenario in the problem description. The program incorrectly prints 'NO' for odd `n`, but it should generate a valid string if possible.
