Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`. For each `n`, if `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it finds the smallest integer `power` such that \(2^{power} \geq n\), and prints \(2^{power}\) or \(2^{power-1}\) depending on whether `power` equals `n` or not. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
