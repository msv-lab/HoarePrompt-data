Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two integers: t and n. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the function does some unspecified processing and returns a result based on these inputs.**

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the function likely iterates over multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` and an integer `n`. However, since the exact operation within the function is not specified, the focus is on the input and output behavior as described.
