### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into individual components.
   - It iterates through each test case, reading the size of the array and the array itself, storing them in a list of tuples.
   - **Correctness**: True

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes each test case.
   - It sorts the array to find the median.
   - It calculates the median index correctly, considering both even and odd lengths of the array.
   - However, the use of a min-heap to increment elements in the second half of the array is flawed. The heap is initialized with elements from the median index onwards, but this approach does not guarantee that the smallest element in the heap will always be the one contributing to the median increase. Specifically, the heap only considers elements from the median index onwards, which means it might not account for the correct elements needed to increase the median.

3. **Heap Operations**:
   - The program initializes a heap with elements from the median index onwards.
   - It repeatedly pops the smallest element from the heap, increments it, and pushes it back until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median.
   - This approach is problematic because it does not consider the entire array and might miss necessary increments. For example, if the median is already the maximum value in the array, no operations would be performed, but the median might still need to be increased by incrementing other elements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles arrays of different sizes and values within the specified range.
   - However, it does not handle cases where the median is already the maximum value in the array, leading to incorrect results.
   - For example, consider the array `[5, 5, 5, 4, 5]`. The median is `5`, and the program would not perform any operations because the heap only contains elements from the median index onwards, and none of these elements are less than `5`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the results for each test case, but due to the flaws in the heap-based approach, the results might be incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the heap-based approach is sufficient to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. The program fails to consider the entire array and might miss necessary increments, leading to incorrect results.

**Final: False**
