You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x // 2
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed, where each integer is half of the corresponding input integer \(x\) for each test case. Specifically, if there are \(t\) test cases, the output will be a list of \(t\) integers, each being the result of \(x_i // 2\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(t\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer \(x\) (with \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\)) and prints half of \(x\) (\(x // 2\)). After processing all test cases, it outputs a list of integers, each being half of the corresponding input integer \(x\).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. According to the problem description, we need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. However, the program simply sets \( y \) to \( x // 2 \), which does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

For example, consider the input \( x = 10 \). The program outputs \( y = 5 \). However, the maximum value of \(\gcd(10, y) + y\) can be achieved with \( y = 5 \) (which gives \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7\)), but other values like \( y = 9 \) also give a higher value (\(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\)).

Thus, the program does not always find the correct \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
