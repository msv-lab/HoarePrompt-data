Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the conditions for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as the value of `int(input())` is a non-negative integer. Given that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), the input will always be a valid non-negative integer within this range.

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since `t` is a positive integer, the value of `int(input())` will be a positive integer within the specified range. Therefore, the loop will execute exactly `t` times.

4. **State the final state**: The initial state mentions that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). The loop will start with `i` being 0 (since `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to \(t-1\)).

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 0**
