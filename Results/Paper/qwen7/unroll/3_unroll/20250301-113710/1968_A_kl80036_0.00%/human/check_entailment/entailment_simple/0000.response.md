Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that the value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
- The provided solution simply prints \( y = \frac{x}{2} \) for each test case. However, this approach does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Let's analyze why the given solution might not be correct:
- If \( x \) is even, \( y = \frac{x}{2} \) could be a candidate, but it doesn't guarantee the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
- If \( x \) is odd, \( y = \frac{x - 1}{2} \) would be a better candidate because \(\gcd(x, \frac{x - 1}{2})\) can be higher compared to \(\gcd(x, \frac{x}{2})\), especially when \( x \) is prime or has specific properties.

Given the example outputs:
- For \( x = 10 \), the correct \( y \) should be 5 (since \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10\)), but the solution gives 5.
- For \( x = 21 \), the correct \( y \) should be 18 (since \(\gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 27\)), but the solution gives 10.
- For \( x = 100 \), the correct \( y \) should be 98 (since \(\gcd(100, 98) + 98 = 198\)), but the solution gives 50.

Thus, the provided solution does not always find the optimal \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Correctness: **False**
