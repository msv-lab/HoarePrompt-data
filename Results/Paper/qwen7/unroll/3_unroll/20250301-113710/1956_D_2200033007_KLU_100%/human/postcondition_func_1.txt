The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, which define a range in a list of non-negative integers `arr`. It aims to find the subarray within this range that has the maximum possible sum and returns specific results based on the conditions met. Specifically, it can return an empty list, a list containing a single tuple `(start_index, start_index)`, a tuple `(start_index, end_index)` indicating the subarray with the maximum possible sum, or recursively call itself with adjusted indices.
