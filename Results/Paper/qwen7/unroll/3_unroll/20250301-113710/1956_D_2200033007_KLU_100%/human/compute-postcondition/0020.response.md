Output State: **`is_already_stairs` is `False`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer, `i` is `i - 1`, and `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called with `i - 1` as an argument. This does not change the values of `is_already_stairs`, `arr`, `start_index`, or the condition `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`. Instead, it modifies `i` to `i - 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from their initial state.
