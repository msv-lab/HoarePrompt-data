Output State: **`is_already_stairs` is `False`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer, `res` is a list containing the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`, and the current value of `i` is 0.**

The code appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index)` to the list `res`. Since `start_index` is an integer, `res` now contains one element which is the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
