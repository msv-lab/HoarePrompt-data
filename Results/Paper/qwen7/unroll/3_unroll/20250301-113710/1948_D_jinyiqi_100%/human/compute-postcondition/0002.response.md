Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `j`: This variable is initialized using `range(n // 2, 0, -1)`, meaning `j` will take values starting from `n // 2` down to 1.

2. **Determine the initial value of `j`**: The loop will start when `j` is set to `n // 2`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is initially set to `n // 2`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than 0. Since `j` starts at `n // 2` and decreases by 1 each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `j` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states**: We need to ensure that `j` is set to `n // 2` and that `n` is such that `n // 2` is greater than 0. Additionally, `s` and `t` do not affect the loop's execution and can remain as they are.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be set to `n // 2`.
- `n` should be such that `n // 2` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the final state after adjusting the necessary variables is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a list of characters from the input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `j` is set to `n // 2`**, and **`n` must be greater than 1**.
