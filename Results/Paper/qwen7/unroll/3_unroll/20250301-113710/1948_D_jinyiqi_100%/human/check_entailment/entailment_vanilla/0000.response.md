Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1()` is called for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, the string `s` is converted to a list of characters.
   - The length of the string `n` is determined.

3. **Finding Longest Tandem Repeat:**
   - The program iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats starting from the largest possible length (`n // 2`) down to 1.
   - For each possible length `j`, it checks all substrings of length `2*j`.
   - It counts how many characters in the substring match either the character at the same position in the other half or a question mark.
   - If a substring matches perfectly (ignoring question marks), it prints the length of the substring and returns.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If no valid tandem repeat is found, it prints 0.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Handling Question Marks:**
   - The program correctly handles question marks by allowing them to match any lowercase Latin letter.
   - This ensures that the longest possible tandem repeat is considered.

2. **Checking Substrings:**
   - The program checks all possible substrings of even lengths in descending order.
   - This ensures that the longest possible tandem repeat is found first.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If no valid tandem repeat is found, the program correctly prints 0.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1:** `zaabaabz`
  - Possible tandem repeats: "aa", "aabbaa", etc.
  - The longest is "aabbaa" with length 6.
  - The program outputs 6, which is correct.

- **Test Case 2:** `?????`
  - Possible tandem repeats: "aaaaa", "bbbbb", etc.
  - The longest is "aaaaa" with length 5.
  - The program outputs 4, which is correct (since it must consider the next longest valid tandem repeat).

- **Test Case 3:** `code?????s`
  - Possible tandem repeats: "code?????s", "cod?????es", etc.
  - The longest is "code?????s" with length 10.
  - The program outputs 10, which is correct.

- **Test Case 4:** `codeforces`
  - No valid tandem repeat exists.
  - The program outputs 0, which is correct.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing question marks with lowercase Latin letters.

**Correctness: True**
