Based on the initial state provided, the precondition states that the value printed is the maximum count * 2, where count is the length of the longest substring that matches the condition: each character in the substring either matches the corresponding character in the mirrored position or is a question mark (?). If no such substring exists, nothing is printed.

However, the code snippet provided simply prints `0`.

Given this, the output must be:

Output: **0**
