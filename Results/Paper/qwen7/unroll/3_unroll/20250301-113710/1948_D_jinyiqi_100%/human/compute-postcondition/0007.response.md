Functionality: The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. It checks for the longest substring where each character either matches the corresponding character in the mirrored position or is a question mark. If such a substring exists, it prints the length of the substring multiplied by 2. If no such substring is found, it prints `0`.
