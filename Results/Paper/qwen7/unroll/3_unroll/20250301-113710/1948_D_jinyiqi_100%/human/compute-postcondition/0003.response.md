Output State: The value printed will be the highest integer `count * 2` where `count` equals `j` for some `j` in the range from `n // 2` to `1`, and the condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` holds true for all `k` in the range from `0` to `n - j`. If no such `j` exists, nothing is printed.
