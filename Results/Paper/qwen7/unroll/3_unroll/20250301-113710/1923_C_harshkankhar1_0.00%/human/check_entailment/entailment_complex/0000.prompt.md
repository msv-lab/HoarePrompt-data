Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

    NO
    YES
    NO

# Annotated Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; the array c is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers entered as input, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated based on the previous element and the value of `a[i]` (if `a[i] > 1`, then `x = 1`, otherwise `x = 2`), starting from `b[0] = 0`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: the cumulative sums of the original list `a`
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in the original list `a`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated based on the previous element and the value of `a[i]` (if `a[i] > 1`, then `x = 1`, otherwise `x = 2`), starting from `b[0] = 0`, the loop iterates `q` times, each time reading two integers `x` and `y` from input, and printing 'NO' if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, otherwise printing 'YES'. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the loop executes all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n`, an integer `q`, an array `a` of `n` positive integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `x` and `y`. For each query, the function checks whether the subarray of `a` from index `x-1` to `y-1` meets the condition `a[y] - a[x-1] >= b[y] - b[x-1]` and `x != y`. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.
