To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in the original list `a`.
   - `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated based on the previous element and the value of `a[i]` (if `a[i] > 1`, then `x = 1`, otherwise `x = 2`), starting from `b[0] = 0`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*a)
   ```

From the initial state, we know that `a` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in the original list `a`. This implies that `a` is a list of cumulative sums, but without knowing the original list, we cannot determine the exact values of `a`.

However, since the question asks for the most precise description possible based on the precondition, we can describe the output as follows:

- The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a`, which is a list of cumulative sums of the original list `a`.

Therefore, the output will be the elements of the list `a` printed in a space-separated format.

Output: **the cumulative sums of the original list `a`**
