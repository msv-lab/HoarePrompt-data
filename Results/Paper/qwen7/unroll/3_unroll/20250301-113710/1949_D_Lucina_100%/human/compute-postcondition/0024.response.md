Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`, meaning `i` will take values from `1` to `n`.

3. **Initial states of relevant objects**:
   - `sa`: Contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`.
   - `sb`: Initially an empty list, but the loop will append indices to `sb` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`.
   - `xx`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - Since the loop depends on the value of `i` and `n`, these are the variables that need adjustment.
   - The initial state of `sb` being empty is already correct because the loop will start appending indices to `sb` during its execution.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should start at `1` (the first iteration).
   - `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` starting at `1` and `n` being greater than `0`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
