Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` should start from 1 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`.
   - `n` is the original input integer.

3. **Consider the postconditions**:
   - `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0.
   - `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0.
   - `xx` is a list of `n` strings received during each iteration of the loop.
   - `a` and `b` are lists of length `n+1` with their original counts of 'F' and 'S' respectively.
   - `n` is the original input integer.
   - `sa` has at least as many elements as `sb`.
   - `sb` is no longer an empty list.

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`, we need to ensure that `i` is within this range.
   - `n` must be a positive integer because the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer**
