Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24; `a` is a list of length n+1 filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. Since `n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 24, `a` will be a list of length `n + 1` containing zeros. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
