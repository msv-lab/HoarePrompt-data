Postcondition: **`nx` is a list of strings constructed based on the conditions provided. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, then `nx` is an empty list. Otherwise, `nx` consists of strings where each character is either 'S' or 'F', determined as follows: if `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', then the character is taken from `xx[i][j-1]`. If `i` or `j` is in the first `n//4 - 1` elements of `sb`, the character is 'S'. Otherwise, the character is 'F'. Since `sb` remains empty, `nx` will only append 'F' for '?' values.**
