Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This integer is within the range of 2 to 24, as specified in the initial state. All other information about the initial state remains unchanged, including the description of the transition videos matrix, which is not affected by this line of code.
