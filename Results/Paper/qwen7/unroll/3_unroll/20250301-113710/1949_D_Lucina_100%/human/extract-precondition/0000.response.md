Precondition: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, where the j-th character of the i-th line represents the transition video between the i-th and the j-th scenarios. Each line contains n characters, and the diagonal elements (i.e., the j-th character of the i-th line where i = j) are always '.', indicating no transition video needed. At most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided, represented by 'F' (funny) or 'S' (scary), and the remaining are undecided, represented by '?'.**
