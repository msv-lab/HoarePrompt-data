Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of (u, v) pairs representing the edges of an undirected graph, `empty` is False, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of adjacent nodes, `ends` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `ends`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `edges`, `empty`, or `nodes`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The only new variable introduced is `ends`, which is an empty list.
