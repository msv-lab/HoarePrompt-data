Output State: **`prev` is `s`, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of (u, v) pairs representing the edges of an undirected graph, `empty` is False, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of adjacent nodes, `ends` is a list containing all the nodes that have exactly one adjacent node in the graph, `tree` is a list containing the element `s`, `curr` is the first adjacent node of `s` in the `nodes` dictionary.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first adjacent node of `s` from the `nodes` dictionary to the variable `curr`. The value of `curr` is the first element in the list of adjacent nodes of `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
