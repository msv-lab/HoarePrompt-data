Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, edges is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `edges`. This does not change the values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, or any other variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and the condition they satisfy remain unchanged. The only new information is that `edges` is now an empty list.
