Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Handling of Test Cases**: The program should handle multiple test cases but only processes one test case per call to `func()`. It should use a loop to process all test cases.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program incorrectly handles the case where the last two cells in the second row do not both point right (`b[-2] != '>'`). This condition alone does not determine if the robot can reach the final cell.

3. **Logic Errors**:
   - The logic for determining if the robot can reach the final cell is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for `no_path` are not correctly set up.
   - The program incorrectly prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions without properly evaluating the path the robot can take.

4. **Improper Looping**: The loops used to check the path are not correctly structured to ensure the robot can navigate from the start to the end.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Check if the last column can be reached
        if b[-1] != '>':
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if there's a path from the first row to the second row
        no_path = True
        for k in range(n):
            if k % 2 == 0:  # Even indices correspond to vertical moves
                if a[k] == '<':
                    no_path = False
                    break
            else:  # Odd indices correspond to horizontal moves
                if b[k] == '<':
                    no_path = False
                    break
        
        if no_path:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version properly handles multiple test cases and checks the necessary conditions to determine if the robot can reach the final cell.
