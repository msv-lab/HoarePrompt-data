Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the value of `int(input())`.
3. **Initial State**: We know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `n` is even. Each test case consists of two strings of length `n`, where each character is either `<` or `>`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means that the value of `i` should be valid for the first iteration, which implies that `i` should be 0 (since `range(int(input()))` generates values from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`).

Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `i` is 0, and `int(input())` is within the valid range for `t`.

**State:**
- `i` is 0
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)

So, the final state to ensure the loop can execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
