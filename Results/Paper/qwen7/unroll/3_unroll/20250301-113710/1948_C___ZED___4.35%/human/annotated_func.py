#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; each test case consists of two strings of length n, where each character in the strings is either '<' or '>', representing the direction of the arrow in each cell of the respective row of the grid.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')

    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; each test case consists of two strings of length n, where each character in the strings is either '<' or '>', representing the direction of the arrow in each cell of the respective row of the grid; after executing all iterations of the loop, the output will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of length n (where n is even), containing characters '<' or '>'. For each test case, it checks specific conditions related to the characters in these strings. If any condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters directly but reads input values from standard input and outputs results to standard output.
