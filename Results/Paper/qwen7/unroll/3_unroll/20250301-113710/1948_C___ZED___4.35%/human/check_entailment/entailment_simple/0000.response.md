Reasoning:
1. **Initial Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.
2. **Grid Size Check**: The program checks if `n` is 1 and directly prints 'YES'. This is a valid base case since if `n` is 1, the robot cannot move to the target cell (2, n).
3. **Last Column Arrow Check**: The program checks if the last column's arrow in the second row (`b[-2]`) is not `'>`', which would mean the robot cannot move to the last column. This is a valid check.
4. **Even Column Path Check**: The program iterates through every other column starting from index 0 (i.e., 0, 2, 4, ...) and ensures that the arrow in the second row points to the right. If any of these arrows do not point to the right, it sets `no_path` to `False`. This ensures that the robot can potentially move from the first row to the second row.
5. **Odd Column Path Check**: The program then iterates through every other column starting from index 1 (i.e., 1, 3, 5, ...) and ensures that the arrow in the first row points to the right. If any of these arrows do not point to the right, it sets `no_path` to `False`. This ensures that the robot can move back to the first row and continue moving towards the last column.
6. **Final Decision**: Based on the above checks, the program correctly prints 'YES' if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the logic and the checks performed, the program appears to handle all the necessary conditions to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

Correctness: **True**
