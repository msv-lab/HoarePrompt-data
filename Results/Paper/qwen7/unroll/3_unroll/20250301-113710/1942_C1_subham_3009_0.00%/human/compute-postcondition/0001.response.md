Output State: **`t` is updated to the integer value of the input, and the value of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain undefined.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial conditions for `n`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this line of code, so they remain undefined. The value of `t` is updated to the integer value of the input received.
