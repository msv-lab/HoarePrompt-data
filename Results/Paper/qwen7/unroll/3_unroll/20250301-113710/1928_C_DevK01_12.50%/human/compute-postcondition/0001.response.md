Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `w` is the square root of `q`, `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ `x` < `n` â‰¤ 10^9; `M` is an empty list.**

The code calculates the square root of `q` and assigns it to `w`. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged, and `M` remains an empty list.
