### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\), which is defined as the sum of differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this, we should aim to have the largest possible value for \(a_2 - a_1\) and the smallest possible value for \(a_3 - a_2\), and so on.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It then finds the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) values in the array.
   - Finally, it prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values (`x - y`).

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in the solution is flawed because it only considers the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the entire array. This does not necessarily maximize the overall beauty of the array.
   - For example, consider the array `[10, 20, 30]`. The difference between the max and min values is `20`, but the actual beauty would be `(20 - 10) + (30 - 20) = 20 + 10 = 30`.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting. The sorted array ensures that the largest differences are used at the beginning of the sequence.

### Conclusion:

The given solution does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
