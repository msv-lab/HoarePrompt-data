### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\), which is defined as the sum of differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this, we should arrange the elements such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It then finds the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) values in the array.
   - Finally, it prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values (`x - y`).

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in the solution is indeed flawed because it only considers the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the entire array. This does not necessarily maximize the overall beauty of the array.
   - As pointed out in the original assessment, for an array like `[10, 20, 30]`, the difference between the max and min values is `20`, but the actual beauty would be `(20 - 10) + (30 - 20) = 20 + 10 = 30`.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting. The sorted array ensures that the largest differences are used at the beginning of the sequence.

5. **Function Summary**:
   - The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of sub-cases), an integer `n` (number of integers), and a list of `n` integers. It then finds the maximum and minimum values in the list and prints their difference. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Given the function summary, the original assessment is accurate. The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem because it does not account for the correct way to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting and calculating the differences between consecutive elements.

### Conclusion:

The given solution does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
