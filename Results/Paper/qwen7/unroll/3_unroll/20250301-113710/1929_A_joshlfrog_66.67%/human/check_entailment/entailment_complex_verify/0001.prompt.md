You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        x = 0
        
        y = 100000000
        
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        
        print(x - y)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), l is an integer, nums is a list of integers, x is an integer initialized to 100000000, y is an integer initialized to 100000000, and the loop has executed t times. After each iteration of the outer loop, x and y are updated based on the values in the list nums, and then x - y is printed. The other variables remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of sub-cases), an integer `n` (number of integers), and a list of `n` integers. It then finds the maximum and minimum values in the list and prints their difference. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\), which is defined as the sum of differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this, we should aim to have the largest possible value for \(a_2 - a_1\) and the smallest possible value for \(a_3 - a_2\), and so on.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It then finds the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) values in the array.
   - Finally, it prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values (`x - y`).

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in the solution is flawed because it only considers the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the entire array. This does not necessarily maximize the overall beauty of the array.
   - For example, consider the array `[10, 20, 30]`. The difference between the max and min values is `20`, but the actual beauty would be `(20 - 10) + (30 - 20) = 20 + 10 = 30`.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting. The sorted array ensures that the largest differences are used at the beginning of the sequence.

### Conclusion:

The given solution does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
