Output State: **`arr` is a list of n integers sorted in ascending order; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `left` is assigned the value 0. The initial state of `arr` and `new_arr` remains unchanged. Therefore, `arr` is still a list of n integers sorted in ascending order, and `new_arr` is still an empty list.
