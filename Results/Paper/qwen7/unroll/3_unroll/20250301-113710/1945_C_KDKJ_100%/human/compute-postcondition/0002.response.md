Output State: a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. The value of n remains unchanged and is within the range 3 <= n <= 3 * 10^5. The variable `func_1` is called multiple times (equal to the number of iterations specified by `input()`), but its exact behavior is not defined, so the content of `a` may or may not change; however, no information about `a` changing is provided, so we assume `a` remains unchanged.
