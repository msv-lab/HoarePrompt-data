Output State: **`cases` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4.**

The code `cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the code does not change the value of `t`, we keep the same condition for `cases`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `b`) remain undefined and will be read in subsequent lines of code.
