Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the best strategy involves multiple exchanges and the associated costs. 

Consider the following example:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 2
  7 3 6 9
  4 3 8 5
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - The optimal strategy would be to exchange with the person at position 2 (costing 3 coins) and then with the person at position 1 (costing 7 coins), resulting in a total cost of 10 coins.
  
- Actual Output:
  - The program outputs 14 coins, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the way the program calculates the minimum cost. It does not properly account for the cumulative cost of exchanging positions and passing through intermediate positions. The current implementation only considers the immediate cost without looking at the overall minimum cost for all possible exchanges.

To fix this, the program needs to consider all possible ways to reach a position within `m` steps and calculate the minimum cost for each path. This requires a more comprehensive approach, potentially involving dynamic programming or a similar method to explore all possible sequences of exchanges.
