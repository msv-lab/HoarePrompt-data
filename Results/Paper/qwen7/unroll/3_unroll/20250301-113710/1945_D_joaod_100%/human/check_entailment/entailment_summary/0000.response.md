Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the minimum cost for Kirill to move from his initial position to a position within the first `m` positions in the queue. The cost involves either swapping with a person in front of him or passing to the next position.

2. **Key Components of the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people (`na_frente`) and the maximum allowable final position (`pos_final`).
   - It then reads the costs for swapping and passing for each position.
   - The logic iterates backward from the initial position to the start of the queue, updating the minimum cost required to reach a position within the allowed range.

3. **Backward Iteration Logic**:
   - The loop correctly handles the backward iteration, considering whether to swap or pass based on the costs.
   - The variable `best` keeps track of the minimum cost required to reach a position within the allowed range.
   - The cost calculation ensures that the minimum cost is updated appropriately.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases like when Kirill's initial position is already within the allowed range (`pos_final`).
   - It correctly updates the total cost based on the minimum cost between swapping and passing.

5. **Output**:
   - The code prints the minimum cost for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
