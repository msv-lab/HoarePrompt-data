Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the objects involved in the loop head:
   - The loop variable `c` (which starts from 0 and increments by 1).
   - The loop control variable `cases`.

2. Determine the initial state of these objects:
   - `cases` is an input integer and is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 10^4\).

3. Understand the loop condition:
   - The loop runs as long as `c < cases`.
   - Initially, `c` is 0.

4. Adjust the states based on the loop head:
   - Since `c` starts at 0, the loop will execute if `cases` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `cases` is greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `cases` must be greater than 0.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

State: **`cases` must be greater than 0**
