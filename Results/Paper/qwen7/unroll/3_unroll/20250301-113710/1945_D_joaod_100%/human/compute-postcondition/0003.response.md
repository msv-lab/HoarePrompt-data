Output State: The output state consists of `cases` lines, each containing the minimum cost (`best`) found for each test case after executing the given loop. Each test case's result is calculated based on the values of `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` for that specific case.
