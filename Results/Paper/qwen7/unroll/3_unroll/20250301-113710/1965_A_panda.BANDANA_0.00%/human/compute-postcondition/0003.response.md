Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies handling multiple test cases, each with a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is expected to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes a number of piles (t) and the number of stones in each pile (n and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The function will perform some operation based on these inputs and return a result accordingly.
