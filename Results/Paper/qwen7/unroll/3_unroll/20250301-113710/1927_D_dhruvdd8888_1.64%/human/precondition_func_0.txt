t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5. The array a is a list of n integers where each element a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 \cdot 10^5. Each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
