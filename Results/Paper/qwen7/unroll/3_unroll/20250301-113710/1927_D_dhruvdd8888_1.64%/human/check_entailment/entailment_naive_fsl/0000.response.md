Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the case where the subarray from `l` to `r` contains only one unique element. In such cases, the program incorrectly prints `-1 -1` instead of indicating that no such pair exists.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
5
3
1 1 1
1
1 3
```

The program will output:
```
-1 -1
```

However, according to the problem description, since there is no pair of different elements within the subarray `[1, 1, 1]`, the correct output should be `-1 -1`. But the program does not handle this edge case properly.

Additionally, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the relevant segment in the `arr` list, but it does not ensure that the segment boundaries are within the query range `[l, r]`. This could lead to incorrect results if the segment boundaries are outside the query range.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the segment boundaries are within the query range and handle the case where the subarray contains only one unique element.
