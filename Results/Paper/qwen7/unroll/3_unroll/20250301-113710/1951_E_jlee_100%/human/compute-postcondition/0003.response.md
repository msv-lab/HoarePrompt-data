Output State: The output state depends on the input integer `t` and the strings provided in each iteration of the loop. For each input string, the program checks specific conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional information if 'YES' is printed. The final output state will consist of all the printed lines from each iteration of the loop.
