The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks specific conditions related to the string `s` and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional information when appropriate. If the conditions are met, it also prints indices or substrings of `s`. The final output consists of all printed lines for each test case.
