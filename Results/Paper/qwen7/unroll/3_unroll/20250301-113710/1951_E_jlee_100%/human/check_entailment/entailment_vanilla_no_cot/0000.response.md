Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided Python function `func()` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling Single Character Strings**: The code correctly handles single character strings by printing "NO". However, it should also check if the single character is a palindrome and print "NO" in that case, which it doesn't.

2. **General Partition Logic**: The logic for partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings is flawed. It checks for specific conditions but does not cover all possible cases where a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle all edge cases properly. For example, it does not correctly identify and partition strings like "lllllllll" or "uuu" into non-palindromic substrings.

4. **Output Format**: The function does not always follow the required output format. For instance, it prints "YES" with only one substring when multiple substrings might be possible.

### Example Test Cases:
- **Input**: `sinktheyacht`
  - **Expected Output**:
    ```
    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    ```
  - **Actual Output**:
    ```
    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    ```

- **Input**: `lllllllll`
  - **Expected Output**:
    ```
    NO
    ```
  - **Actual Output**:
    ```
    YES
    1
    lllllllll
    ```

- **Input**: `uwuowouwu`
  - **Expected Output**:
    ```
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    ```
  - **Actual Output**:
    ```
    YES
    1
    uwuowouwu
    ```

### Conclusion:
The provided function does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
