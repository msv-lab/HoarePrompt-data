Output State: **`wins` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()` converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `wins` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
