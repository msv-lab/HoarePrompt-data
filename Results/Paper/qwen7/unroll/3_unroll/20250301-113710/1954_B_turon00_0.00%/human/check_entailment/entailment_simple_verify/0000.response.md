### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to verify the correctness of the program.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are the same using `set(a)`.
   - If all elements are the same, it prints `-1`, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Finding Minimum Removals:**
   - The program initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array.
   - It uses a counter `cnt` to count the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
   - When an element different from `tmp` is encountered, it updates `ans` with the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the final value of `cnt`.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

- **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimum Removals:**
  - The program only counts consecutive elements equal to `tmp`. This approach does not account for the requirement to remove elements to break the beauty condition.
  - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program would incorrectly find that the minimum number of removals needed is 0, as it only counts consecutive elements.

- **Example Analysis:**
  - Consider the input:
    ```
    5
    1 2 1 2 1
    ```
  - The program should output `1` because removing the second element (which is `2`) will make the array `[1, 1, 2, 1]`, and it is no longer beautiful.
  - However, the current implementation will output `0` because it only counts consecutive elements.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program only counts consecutive elements equal to `tmp` and does not handle the requirement to break the beauty condition properly.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
