Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function returns different outputs based on the values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes a count `t`, a size `n`, and an array `a` of integers. The function processes each test case according to the given constraints and returns appropriate results for each.
