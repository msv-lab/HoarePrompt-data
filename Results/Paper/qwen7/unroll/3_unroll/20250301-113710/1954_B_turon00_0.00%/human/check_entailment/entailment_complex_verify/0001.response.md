### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given array to make it non-beautiful.
   - An array is considered beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Given Solution Analysis:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints `-1` because the array cannot be made non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and uses a set `aa` to get unique elements.
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive elements equal to `tmp` and updates the answer (`ans`) with the minimum count of consecutive elements.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum count found.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Edge Case Handling:** The solution correctly handles the case where all elements are the same by printing `-1`.
   - **Logic for Counting Consecutive Elements:** The logic for counting consecutive elements and updating the minimum count seems correct.
   - **Set Usage:** Using a set to find unique elements is unnecessary and can be simplified. The set `aa` is only used to check if all elements are the same, which is redundant since we already know the array is beautiful.
   - **Final Answer Calculation:** The final answer calculation seems to be based on finding the minimum length of consecutive elements which is a valid approach to determine the minimum removals needed.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The use of `set` to find unique elements is redundant since we can directly check for consecutive elements without needing a set.
   - The logic for determining the minimum removals could be optimized further, but the current implementation seems to work.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points.
   - The function processes each test case as expected, checking for identical elements and calculating the minimum number of removals needed.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Despite the redundancy of using a set to check for unique elements, the core logic of the program is correct and works as intended.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct despite the redundancy in using a set to check for unique elements. The core logic of the program accurately determines the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
