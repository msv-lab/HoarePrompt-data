Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to account for the fact that each extrovert needs a tent with two others, and it does not properly distribute the remaining universals after assigning tents to introverts and extroverts.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `1 2 5`
- Expected Output: `3`
- Actual Output: `-1`

Here's why the program fails:
- The program checks if `(b + c) % 3 != 0` and prints `-1` if true. However, this condition is too restrictive. For example, with `a = 1`, `b = 2`, and `c = 5`, we can still accommodate everyone:
  - 1 tent for the introvert.
  - 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal.
  - 1 tent for the remaining 3 universals.
  - Total: 3 tents.

The program incorrectly prints `-1` because `(b + c) % 3 != 0` evaluates to true, even though a valid solution exists.

To fix this, the program should distribute the universals more flexibly after assigning tents to introverts and extroverts.
