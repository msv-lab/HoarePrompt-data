Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Handling of Extroverts and Universals:**
   - The current logic does not correctly account for the distribution of extroverts and universals. Specifically, the condition `if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:` is not sufficient to handle all cases where it's impossible to place everyone in tents according to their preferences.

2. **Calculation of Tents:**
   - The calculation of tents should consider the exact placement of introverts, extroverts, and universals. The current approach of simply adding `a` and `(b + c) // 3` and then checking for additional tents might not always yield the correct result.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        
        # All introverts need individual tents
        k += a
        
        # Handle extroverts and universals
        remaining_people = b + c
        if remaining_people == 0:
            print(k)
            continue
        
        # Check if it's possible to place all extroverts and universals
        if remaining_people % 3 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the number of full tents needed for extroverts and universals
        full_tents = remaining_people // 3
        k += full_tents
        
        # Remaining people after placing full tents
        remaining_people -= full_tents * 3
        
        # If there are any remaining people, we need an additional tent
        if remaining_people > 0:
            k += 1
        
        print(k)

```

This corrected version ensures that:
- All introverts get individual tents.
- Extroverts and universals are placed in full tents of 3 people.
- If there are leftover people after placing full tents, an additional tent is needed.
- If it's impossible to place everyone in tents according to their preferences, it outputs `-1`.
