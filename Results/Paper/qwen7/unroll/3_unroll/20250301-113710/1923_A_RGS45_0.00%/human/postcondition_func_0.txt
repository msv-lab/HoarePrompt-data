The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) (the number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (the length of the binary string), and a binary string representing the state of \( n \) cells. It then finds the substring between the first and last occurrence of '1' (inclusive) and counts the number of '0's in this substring. The function outputs the count of '0's for each test case.
