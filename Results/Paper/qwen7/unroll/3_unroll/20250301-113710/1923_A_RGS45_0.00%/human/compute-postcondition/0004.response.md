Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined within its scope. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list of n integers a (where each a[i] is either 0 or 1). The function returns the count of cells containing chips (i.e., the count of 1s in the list a).**
