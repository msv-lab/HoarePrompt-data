Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The function reads the entire line as a string (`arr = str(input(''))`) instead of reading the space-separated integers representing the state of each cell. This will result in a string like "0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0" being read as a single string rather than a list of integers.

2. **Finding First and Last Chip Positions**: The function uses `arr.find('1')` and `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the positions of the first and last chips. However, these methods return the index of the first '1' and the index of the first '1' from the end, respectively. This approach does not account for the presence of free cells between chips.

3. **Counting Free Cells Between Chips**: The function then extracts a substring `z = arr[x:n - y]` and counts the number of '0's in this substring. This is incorrect because it does not ensure that the chips are moved to form a single block without any free cells between them.

4. **Output Calculation**: The output should be the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block. The current implementation simply counts the number of free cells between the first and last chip, which does not reflect the actual number of operations needed.

Given these issues, the provided function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
