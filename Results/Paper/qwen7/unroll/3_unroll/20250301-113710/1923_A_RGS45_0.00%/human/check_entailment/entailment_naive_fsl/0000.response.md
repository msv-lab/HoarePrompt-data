Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Specifically, the program does not account for the distance between chips and free cells, which is crucial for determining the minimum number of operations. For example, consider the input:

```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```

The program will incorrectly output `1` because it only checks for the presence of '1's and counts the zeros between them, but it does not consider the optimal way to move the chips. The correct output for this case should be `1`, but the program logic does not ensure this. A more detailed algorithm is needed to calculate the minimum number of operations based on the distances between chips and free cells.
