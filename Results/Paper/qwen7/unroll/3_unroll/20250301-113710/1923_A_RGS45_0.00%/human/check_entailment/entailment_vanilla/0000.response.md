### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to move chips to form a single block with no free cells between them, and we need to find the minimum number of operations required.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` takes input but does not match the expected behavior for solving the problem.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and a string `arr` representing the state of the cells (where '1' indicates a chip and '0' indicates a free cell).
   - The code finds the positions of the first and last chips (`x` and `y` respectively) and extracts a substring `z` from `x` to `n-y`.
   - Finally, it counts the number of zeros ('0') in the substring `z`.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The approach of counting zeros in the substring `z` does not correctly determine the minimum number of operations needed.
   - The logic for moving chips to the closest free cell to the left is missing.
   - The method of finding the closest free cell to the left for each chip is not implemented.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem, we need to count the number of operations required to move all chips to the leftmost contiguous block.
   - We should iterate through the string and count the number of zeros (free cells) between consecutive ones (chips).

### Correctness:

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

**Correctness: False**
