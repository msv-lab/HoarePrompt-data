Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a string `s` of length `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10) consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'. It finds the last occurrence of 'B' in the string and calculates the distance from the end of the string to this occurrence, then returns this distance plus 2.**
