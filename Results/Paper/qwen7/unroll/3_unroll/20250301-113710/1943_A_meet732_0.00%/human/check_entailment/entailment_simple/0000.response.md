### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing optimally on an array `a` to maximize and minimize the MEX of the resulting array `c`, respectively. The key is to understand how Alice and Bob can play to achieve their respective goals.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Alice always picks elements from `a` and appends them to `c`.
   - Bob always picks elements from `a` and removes them without adding to `c`.
   - The MEX of `c` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice will try to ensure that the MEX is maximized.
   - Bob will try to ensure that the MEX is minimized.

4. **Analysis of the Provided Code**:
   - The code correctly initializes the count array `cntl` to keep track of the frequency of each element in `a`.
   - It checks if `cntl[0]` is zero, which means there are no zeros in `a`. In this case, the MEX is 0.
   - If `cntl[0]` is not zero, the code calculates the initial MEX (`c`) as the minimum of 2 and the count of zeros.
   - Then, it iterates through the counts from 1 to `n` and decreases the MEX counter until it finds an element with a count less than 2 or reaches the end of the array.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the MEX by considering the counts of elements in `a`.
   - The approach ensures that the MEX is calculated based on the optimal moves of both players.
   - The code handles all edge cases, including when there are no zeros in `a`.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the optimal MEX value for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
