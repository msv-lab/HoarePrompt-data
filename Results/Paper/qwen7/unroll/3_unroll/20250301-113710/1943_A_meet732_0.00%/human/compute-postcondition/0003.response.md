Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list a of n non-negative integers (each less than n). The sum of all elements in list a across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. The function returns information or performs operations based on the given test cases.**

This functionality describes a function that iterates over multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. The function processes these inputs without any direct parameters and returns results or performs operations based on the provided data.
