Output State: **`a` is a list of n non-negative integers, where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and n is not equal to 2; `winNext` is the result of calling `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`**.

This means that the list `a` remains unchanged, but a new variable `winNext` has been created and assigned the result of the function call `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`. The length of the list used in the function call is `n-1`, and the first element of the list `a` is excluded from this call.
