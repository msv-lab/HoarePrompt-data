The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of non-negative integers. It first removes duplicates and sorts the list, then calculates the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list to create a new list `a_new`. Finally, it returns this new list `a_new` while ensuring the original list `a` remains unchanged.
