Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `ans` is `ans + k * b`, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9.**

Explanation: The code `ans += k * b` updates the value of `ans` by adding `k * b` to its current value. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
