Reasoning:
1. The main program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case, reading `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case.
2. It uses binary search to find the maximum value of `k` such that the profit is maximized.
3. The `func_1` function is used to check if a given `k` results in a feasible solution where the total profit is within the constraints.
4. The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it checks if the total profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which is not the correct condition for maximizing profit.

The correct condition should be to maximize the profit, which means we need to ensure that the total profit calculated by `ans` is indeed the maximum possible profit. The current implementation incorrectly limits the profit by comparing it with `n * max(a, b)`.

The correct approach would be to calculate the profit directly and compare it with the previously found maximum profit.

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect condition in the binary search function.

Correctness: **False**
