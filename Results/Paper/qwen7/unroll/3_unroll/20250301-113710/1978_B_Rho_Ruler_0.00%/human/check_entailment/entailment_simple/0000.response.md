Reasoning:
The annotated program attempts to solve the problem using binary search to find the optimal `k` value that maximizes the profit. However, there are several issues with the logic used in the `func_1` function and the overall approach.

1. **Incorrect Profit Calculation**: The `func_1` function calculates the total profit incorrectly. It should calculate the profit as `ans = k * b + (n - k) * a`. Instead, it checks if this value is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which does not make sense in the context of maximizing profit.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic is flawed. The condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)` is not relevant to finding the maximum profit. The goal is to maximize the profit, not check if it's within some arbitrary limit.

3. **Profit Maximization**: The correct approach would be to directly calculate the profit for different values of `k` and keep track of the maximum profit found.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
