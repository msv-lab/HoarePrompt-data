Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize Bob's profit. The core issue lies in the `func_1` function, which is used to check if a given `k` value results in a valid profit calculation. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not ensure that the profit is maximized.

Specifically, the condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)` in `func_1` is incorrect. This condition checks if the calculated profit is less than or equal to the maximum possible profit if all buns were sold at the higher price (`max(a, b)`). However, this does not guarantee that the profit is maximized. Instead, we need to directly compare the profit for different values of `k` and choose the one that gives the maximum profit.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = 0
            if k > 0:
                profit += sum(b - i for i in range(k))
            profit += (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible values of `k` from 0 to `n`, calculates the profit for each `k`, and keeps track of the maximum profit found. This ensures that the program correctly identifies the maximum profit Bob can obtain.
