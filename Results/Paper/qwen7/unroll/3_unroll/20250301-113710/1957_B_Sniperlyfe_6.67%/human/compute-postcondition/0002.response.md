Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` where each element is `k-1`, and `k` is less than or equal to 0.

Explanation: 
- The loop iterates `n` times.
- In each iteration, `nums[i]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is `k-1` since `k.bit_length()` gives the number of bits necessary to represent `k` in binary, and shifting `1` left by `k.bit_length() - 1` positions and subtracting `1` results in `k-1`.
- Then, `k` is decremented by `nums[i]`, which is `k-1`.
- After `n` iterations, `k` will be reduced by `n * (k-1)`. Since `k-1` is a positive value, `k` will eventually become less than or equal to 0 if `n` is large enough. If `n` is small, `k` might still be greater than 0 but will be significantly reduced. However, the exact final value of `k` depends on its initial value and the number of iterations `n`.
