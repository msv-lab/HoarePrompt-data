Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` where each element is `k-1`, and `k` is less than or equal to 0; `nums[-1]` is `k-1` and `k` is less than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: Initially, `nums` is a list of length `n` where each element is `k-1`, and `k` is less than or equal to 0. After the loop, each element in `nums` remains `k-1` because the loop decreases `k` by `nums[i]` (which is `k-1`) until `k` becomes less than or equal to 0. The last assignment `nums[-1] += k` adds the current value of `k` to the last element of `nums`. Since `k` is already less than or equal to 0, adding `k` to `nums[-1]` results in `nums[-1]` being `k-1 + k = 2k-1`, which is still `k-1` because `k` is non-positive. Therefore, the last element of `nums` is still `k-1`, and `k` is less than or equal to 0.
