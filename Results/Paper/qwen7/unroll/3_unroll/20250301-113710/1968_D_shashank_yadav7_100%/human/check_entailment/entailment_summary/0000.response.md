Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\).
2. For each test case, it reads the necessary inputs including the permutation \(p\) and the array \(a\).
3. It adjusts the starting positions \(b\) and \(s\) to zero-based indices.
4. It initializes `bm` and `sm` to represent the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively, considering they might stay at their initial positions for all \(k\) turns.
5. In the loop, it simulates the game for \(k\) turns, updating the positions and recalculating the maximum possible scores for both players based on their moves.
6. After the loop, it compares the final maximum scores and prints the appropriate outcome ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to follow the rules of the game correctly and should produce the expected outcomes for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
