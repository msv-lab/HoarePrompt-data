The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \(t\), \(n\), \(k\), and two indices \(b\) and \(s\). It also takes two lists, \(p\) and \(a\), both of length \(n\). For each test case, it calculates two values, \(bm\) and \(sm\), based on the elements of \(a\) and the permutations defined by \(p\). It then compares these values and prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on their relative sizes. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.
