Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b` (Bodya's starting position), and `s` (Sasha's starting position).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Starting Positions:**
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 because the indices start from 0 in Python.

3. **Initial Scores Calculation:**
   - The initial scores `sp` (Sasha's score) and `bp` (Bodya's score) are set to the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively.
   - The maximum possible scores `sm` (Sasha's maximum score) and `bm` (Bodya's maximum score) are initially set to `a[s] * k` and `a[b] * k`, respectively.

4. **Game Simulation:**
   - A loop runs up to `k` times (or until `k` becomes 0).
   - In each iteration:
     - The positions `b` and `s` are updated to their respective `p[b]` and `p[s]` positions.
     - The scores `sp` and `bp` are updated by adding the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively.
     - The maximum possible scores `sm` and `bm` are updated by considering the new positions and the remaining number of turns `k`.

5. **Output Determination:**
   - After the loop, the program compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner.
   - If `bm > sm`, it prints "Bodya".
   - If `bm < sm`, it prints "Sasha".
   - If `bm == sm`, it prints "Draw".

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Initialization:**
   - The initial scores `sp` and `bp` are correctly initialized to the starting values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`.

2. **Score Updates:**
   - The scores `sp` and `bp` are updated correctly by adding the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]` in each iteration.
   - The maximum possible scores `sm` and `bm` are updated correctly by considering the new positions and the remaining number of turns `k`.

3. **Position Updates:**
   - The positions `b` and `s` are updated correctly by moving to the positions specified by the permutation `p`.

4. **Final Comparison:**
   - The final comparison between `bm` and `sm` is done correctly to determine the winner.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic implemented in the function is correct according to the problem description. The program correctly simulates the game and determines the winner based on the given rules.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
