Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` and adjusts `b` and `s` to be zero-indexed.
3. It initializes `sp` and `bp` with the scores at the starting positions for Sasha and Bodya, respectively.
4. It calculates the maximum possible scores (`bm` for Bodya and `sm` for Sasha) by considering all possible moves up to `k` turns.
5. The logic inside the loop correctly updates the positions and scores for both players, ensuring that the maximum possible scores are captured.
6. Finally, it compares the maximum scores and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic appears to be sound and correctly implements the rules of the game. There are no apparent logical errors or missing steps in the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
