Functionality: **The function accepts parameters t, n, k, P_B, P_S, p, and a. t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. n and k are integers with 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9 respectively. p is a list of n integers representing a permutation where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n for all i. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i. The function returns a value based on the given parameters.**
