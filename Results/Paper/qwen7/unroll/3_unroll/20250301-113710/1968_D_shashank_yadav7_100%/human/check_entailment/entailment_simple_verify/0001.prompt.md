You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: Output State: t is an input integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, the following variables are updated after the loop execution:
    #
    #- n, k, b, s are integers representing the length of lists p and a, a starting index, and another starting index respectively.
    #- p and a are lists of integers.
    #- After the loop, bm and sm are updated based on the maximum values calculated during the iterations.
    #- The loop prints 'Bodya' if bm is greater than sm, 'Sasha' if bm is less than sm, and 'Draw' if bm equals sm.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b` (Bodya's starting position), and `s` (Sasha's starting position).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Starting Positions:**
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 because the indices start from 0 in Python.

3. **Initial Scores Calculation:**
   - The initial scores `sp` (Sasha's score) and `bp` (Bodya's score) are set to the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively.
   - The maximum possible scores `sm` (Sasha's maximum score) and `bm` (Bodya's maximum score) are initially set to `a[s] * k` and `a[b] * k`, respectively.

4. **Game Simulation:**
   - A loop runs up to `k` times (or until `k` becomes 0).
   - In each iteration:
     - The positions `b` and `s` are updated to their respective `p[b]` and `p[s]` positions.
     - The scores `sp` and `bp` are updated by adding the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively.
     - The maximum possible scores `sm` and `bm` are updated by considering the new positions and the remaining number of turns `k`.

5. **Output Determination:**
   - After the loop, the program compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner.
   - If `bm > sm`, it prints "Bodya".
   - If `bm < sm`, it prints "Sasha".
   - If `bm == sm`, it prints "Draw".

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Initialization:**
   - The initial scores `sp` and `bp` are correctly initialized to the starting values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`.

2. **Score Updates:**
   - The scores `sp` and `bp` are updated correctly by adding the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]` in each iteration.
   - The maximum possible scores `sm` and `bm` are updated correctly by considering the new positions and the remaining number of turns `k`.

3. **Position Updates:**
   - The positions `b` and `s` are updated correctly by moving to the positions specified by the permutation `p`.

4. **Final Comparison:**
   - The final comparison between `bm` and `sm` is done correctly to determine the winner.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic implemented in the function is correct according to the problem description. The program correctly simulates the game and determines the winner based on the given rules.
