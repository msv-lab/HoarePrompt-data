Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `output1` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `output1`. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated information about `output1` being an empty list while keeping the initial conditions for `x` and `n`.
