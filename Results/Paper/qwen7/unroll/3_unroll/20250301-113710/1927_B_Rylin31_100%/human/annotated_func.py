#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the trace is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n.

        l = int(input())

    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the trace is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. After executing the loop, for each test case, ans is a string generated by iterating through the input array, where each character in ans is determined by the value of s[a_i] (converted to a character starting from 'a') and then incrementing s[a_i] by 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `t` and `n`, followed by a list of `n` non-negative integers. It then generates a string `ans` by iterating through the list, converting each index value to a corresponding character in the alphabet (starting from 'a'), and increments the value at that index by 1 after each use. Finally, it prints the generated string `ans` for each test case.
