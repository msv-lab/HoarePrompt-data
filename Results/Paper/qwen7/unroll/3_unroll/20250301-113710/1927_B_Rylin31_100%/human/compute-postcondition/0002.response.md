Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the trace is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. After executing the loop, for each test case, ans is a string generated by iterating through the input array, where each character in ans is determined by the value of s[a_i] (converted to a character starting from 'a') and then incrementing s[a_i] by 1.
