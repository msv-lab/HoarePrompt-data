Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers `s`. It then maps each integer in `s` to a corresponding character in the alphabet (starting from 'a') based on the count of occurrences of each integer in `s`. Finally, it prints a string composed of these characters.**
