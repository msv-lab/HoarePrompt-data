Reasoning:

The given program aims to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

Here's a breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Initialization**: Variables `same`, `num`, and `minn` are initialized to keep track of the current streak of identical elements, the last seen element, and the minimum length of such streaks found so far.

3. **Loop through the Array**: The program iterates through the array starting from the second element. It checks if the current element is the same as the previous one (`ar[i] == num`). If it is, it increments the `same` counter. If it is not, it updates `num` to the current element, resets `same` to 1, and updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.

4. **Final Check**: After the loop, it checks if `minn` is still infinity (`inf`). If it is, it means there were no sequences of consecutive identical elements, and thus the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements. In this case, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

5. **Output**: The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function `func()` appears to be correct. It correctly identifies the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the array and handles the special case where no such sequence exists.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
