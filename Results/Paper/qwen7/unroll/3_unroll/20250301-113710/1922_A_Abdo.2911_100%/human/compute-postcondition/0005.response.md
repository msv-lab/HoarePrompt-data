Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it checks if it's possible to rearrange the characters of string `c` such that no position has the same character as in `a` or `b`. If such a rearrangement is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
