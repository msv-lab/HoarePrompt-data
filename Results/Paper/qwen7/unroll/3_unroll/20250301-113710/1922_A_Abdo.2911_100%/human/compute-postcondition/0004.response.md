Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it returns different outputs based on the values of `t`, `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.**
