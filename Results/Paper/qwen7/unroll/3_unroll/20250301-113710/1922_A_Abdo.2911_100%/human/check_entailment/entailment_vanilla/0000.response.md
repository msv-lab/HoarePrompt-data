### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - For each character position `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the code checks if the characters in `a` and `b` at position `i` are the same.
   - If they are the same, it checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). If `c[i]` is different, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the characters in `a` and `b` at position `i` are different, it checks if `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If `c[i]` is not equal to either, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
3. **Output Determination**:
   - If `possible` is `True` after checking all positions, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- The logic for determining if a template exists where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not is correct.
- The code correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem statement.
- The loop iterates through each character position and checks the conditions accurately.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
