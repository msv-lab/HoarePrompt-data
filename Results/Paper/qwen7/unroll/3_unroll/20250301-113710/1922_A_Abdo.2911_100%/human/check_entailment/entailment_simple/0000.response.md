Reasoning:

1. The function `func_1()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It initializes a boolean variable `possible` to `False`, which will be used to determine if a valid template exists.
4. The function then iterates over each character in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` to check if a template can be found that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.

   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, and `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop because we have found a mismatch.
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, and `c[i]` is either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, it continues to the next iteration.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.

5. After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, it prints "YES", indicating that a valid template exists. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Given this analysis, the logic in the function appears to correctly implement the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
