Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into individual components. This ensures that the input is parsed correctly even for large inputs.

2. **Test Case Processing**: Each test case is processed individually. The program extracts the necessary parameters (n, x, y, and the array) and stores them in a list of tuples named `test_cases`.

3. **Residue Calculation and Pair Counting**:
   - For each number in the array, the program calculates the residues `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
   - These residues are used as keys in a dictionary (`residue_map`) to keep track of the count of occurrences of each unique pair of residues.
   - The count of beautiful pairs is incremented based on the count of previously seen pairs with the same residues.

4. **Result Collection**: After processing each array, the count of beautiful pairs is appended to the `results` list.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the results for each test case.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs for each test case. The provided example and the annotated program confirm that the logic is sound and the implementation matches the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
