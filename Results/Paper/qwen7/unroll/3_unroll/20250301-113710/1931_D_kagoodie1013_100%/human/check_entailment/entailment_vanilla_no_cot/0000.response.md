Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given problem description. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case, and calculates the number of beautiful pairs using the `func_1` function. The logic within `func_1` is sound and should work as intended for the problem constraints.
