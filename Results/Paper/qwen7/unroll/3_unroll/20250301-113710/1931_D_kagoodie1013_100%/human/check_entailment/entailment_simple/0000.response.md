Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input and parses them into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the necessary information (n, x, y, and the array `arr`).
2. **Function Definition**: The `func_1` function processes each test case individually. It initializes a counter `count` to zero and uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the occurrences of specific residue pairs `(r_x, r_y)`.
3. **Residue Calculation**: For each element in the array `arr`, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y` using the formulas `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`. These residues are used to form a key in the `residue_map`.
4. **Count Calculation**: The count of beautiful pairs is incremented by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, which effectively counts how many times the same residue pair has been encountered before.
5. **Result Collection**: After processing all elements in the array, the count of beautiful pairs is added to the `results` list.
6. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the results for each test case.

Given the logic and the state transitions described, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem statement. There are no logical errors or discrepancies between the expected behavior and the actual implementation.

Correctness: **True**
