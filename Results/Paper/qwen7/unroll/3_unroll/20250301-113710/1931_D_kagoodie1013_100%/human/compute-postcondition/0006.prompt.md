You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The values of n, x, and y satisfy 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        residue_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            r_x = -num % x
            r_y = num % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = num % x, num % y
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the sum of counts of residue pairs `(r_x, r_y)` for each list of integers `arr` in `test_cases`. For each tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` in `test_cases`, the loop calculates the count of unique pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` for every number `num` in `arr`, where `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`, and appends the total count to `results`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers called 'results', where each integer represents the sum of counts of residue pairs (r_x, r_y) for each list of integers 'arr' in 'test_cases'. For each tuple (n, x, y, arr) in 'test_cases', the loop calculates the count of unique pairs of residues (r_x, r_y) for every number 'num' in 'arr', where r_x = -num % x and r_y = num % y, and appends the total count to 'results'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). For each tuple in `test_cases`, the function calculates the sum of counts of residue pairs (r_x, r_y) for the list of integers `arr`. The result is a list of integers called 'results', where each integer represents the total count of such residue pairs for each list in `test_cases`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of integers called 'results', where each integer represents the sum of counts of residue pairs (r_x, r_y) for each list of integers 'arr' in 'test_cases'. For each tuple (n, x, y, arr) in 'test_cases', the loop calculates the count of unique pairs of residues (r_x, r_y) for every number 'num' in 'arr', where r_x = -num % x and r_y = num % y, and appends the total count to 'results'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
