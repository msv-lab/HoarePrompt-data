### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into parts.
   - It correctly parses the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.

2. **Residue Calculation**:
   - For each number `num` in the array, the program calculates `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
   - These calculations are used to determine the residue pairs `(r_x, r_y)`.

3. **Residue Map Usage**:
   - A dictionary `residue_map` is used to count occurrences of each residue pair `(r_x, r_y)`.
   - For each number `num`, the program checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in `residue_map` and increments the count accordingly.
   - This ensures that pairs of numbers with the same residues contribute to the count of beautiful pairs.

4. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The count of beautiful pairs is incremented based on the presence of the required residue pairs in `residue_map`.
   - The final count for each test case is appended to the `results` list.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of Residue Calculation**:
  - The calculation `r_x = -num % x` is mathematically equivalent to `r_x = (x - num % x) % x`. This ensures that `r_x` is always non-negative and less than `x`.
  - Similarly, `r_y = num % y` is straightforward and correct.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program uses a dictionary to store and count residue pairs, which allows for efficient lookups and updates.
  - The time complexity for processing each test case is O(n), where n is the length of the array. Given the constraints, this is efficient.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies and counts pairs that satisfy the conditions.
  - The use of `-num % x` ensures that the program works correctly even when `num` is negative (though negative numbers are not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement).

- **Overall Logic**:
  - The overall logic of the program is sound and follows the problem statement accurately.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. The use of residue maps ensures efficient counting and handling of all potential cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
