The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers \(h\), \(w\), \(x_a\), \(y_a\), \(x_b\), and \(y_b\). For each test case, it determines whether the points \((x_a, y_a)\) and \((x_b, y_b)\) are distinct and within specified ranges. Based on specific conditions involving these points, the function appends one of three outcomes ('Draw', 'Bob', 'Alice') to a list. After processing all test cases, the function prints each outcome on a new line.
