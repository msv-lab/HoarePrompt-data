Reasoning:
- The provided program attempts to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
- The program uses a series of `if` and `elif` statements to handle the conversion based on the hour part of the time.
- However, there are several issues with this approach:
  - The code is highly repetitive and can be simplified using modulo arithmetic.
  - The program incorrectly handles the conversion for the hour '00'. It should be '12' AM, but it incorrectly sets it to '12' PM.
  - The program does not handle the case where the hour is '12' in the 24-hour format. It should be '12' PM, but the current implementation sets it to 'PM' without checking if it's the last hour of the day.
- Given these issues, the program does not correctly convert all times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.

Correctness: **False**
