You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format where hh is the hour from 00 to 23 and mm is the minute from 00 to 59.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a time in the format "h1 : m AM/PM", where "h1" is the hour converted to 12-hour format, "m" is the minute, and "AM/PM" indicates whether it is morning or afternoon. The specific times printed depend on the inputs provided during the loop executions. Each line represents the transformed time from the input "hh:mm" into 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an integer `t` (where 1 <= t <= 1440) and a string `s` in the format "hh:mm". It returns a specific output based on the conditions given for `t` and the time represented by `s`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
