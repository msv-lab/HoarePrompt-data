Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by optimally selecting cards during the game.
2. The provided program uses dynamic programming to solve this problem. It initializes a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum points you can achieve with the first `i+1` cards in your hand and having `j` points.
3. The program correctly handles the base cases (`dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]`).
4. The nested loops iterate backward through the cards and points, ensuring that the DP table is filled correctly based on the counts of each card.
5. The logic inside the loops correctly considers the different scenarios (0, 1, or 2 occurrences of the current card) and updates the DP table accordingly.
6. The final result is stored in `dp[0][0]`, which is returned as the answer.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program logic aligns with the requirements and constraints of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
