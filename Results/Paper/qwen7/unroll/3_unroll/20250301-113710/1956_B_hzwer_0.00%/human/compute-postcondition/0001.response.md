Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the list `cards` contains integers from the input split by spaces, representing the integers on the cards in your hand, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice.**

Explanation: The code `cards = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `cards`. The conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `cards` now holds the integers entered by the user.
