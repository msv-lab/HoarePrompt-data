Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but considers a list of integers `a` and two integers `t` and `n` with specific constraints. It calculates and returns the maximum value obtained by a given logic, which involves dynamic programming and iterating over the list of integers.**

Note: The actual implementation details and logic are not described here, only the functionality based on the provided constraints and output.
