Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents the integers on the cards in your hand, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the list of integers on the cards (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) is not modified by this operation. Therefore, the conditions and values of `t` and the list remain as they were initially, while `n` now holds the value of the integer input by the user.
