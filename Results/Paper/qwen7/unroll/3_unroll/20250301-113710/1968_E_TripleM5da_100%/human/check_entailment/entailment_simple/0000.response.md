Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The program always prints the same fixed pattern of coordinates regardless of the input values of \( n \). This means that the Manhattan distances calculated will be limited and will not necessarily maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\).

To verify, let's consider the example cases given in the problem statement:

1. For \( n = 2 \):
   - The program outputs: 
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     3 3
     ```
   - Calculating the Manhattan distances:
     - Distance between (1,1) and (1,2): \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
     - Distance between (1,1) and (3,3): \( |1-3| + |1-3| = 4 \)
     - Distance between (1,2) and (3,3): \( |1-3| + |2-3| = 3 \)
   - Set of distances: \(\{1, 4, 3\}\)
   - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 3

   However, the optimal solution for \( n = 2 \) should be:
   ```
   1 1
   1 2
   ```
   - Set of distances: \(\{1\}\)
   - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 1

2. For \( n = 3 \):
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     3 3
     4 4
     ```
   - Calculating the Manhattan distances:
     - Distance between (1,1) and (1,2): \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
     - Distance between (1,1) and (3,3): \( |1-3| + |1-3| = 4 \)
     - Distance between (1,1) and (4,4): \( |1-4| + |1-4| = 6 \)
     - Distance between (1,2) and (3,3): \( |1-3| + |2-3| = 3 \)
     - Distance between (1,2) and (4,4): \( |1-4| + |2-4| = 5 \)
     - Distance between (3,3) and (4,4): \( |3-4| + |3-4| = 2 \)
   - Set of distances: \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\)
   - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 6

   However, the optimal solution for \( n = 3 \) should be:
   ```
   2 1
   2 3
   3 1
   ```
   - Set of distances: \(\{1, 2, 3\}\)
   - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 3

From these examples, it is clear that the program does not generate the maximum set of Manhattan distances for each \( n \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
