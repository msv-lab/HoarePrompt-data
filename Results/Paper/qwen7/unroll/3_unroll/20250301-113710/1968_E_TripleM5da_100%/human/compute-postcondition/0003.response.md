Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information, but it processes these two integers within its scope.**

However, since the exact return value is not specified in the given information, we can only describe the parameter constraints and their implications.
