Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all potential cases. Specifically, for \(n > 2\), the program only prints two points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), followed by a loop that prints points \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\). This approach does not necessarily maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, consider \(n = 3\):
- The program outputs:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  3 3
  4 4
  ```
- The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is:
  \[
  \mathcal{H} = \{ |1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |2-2|, |1-1| + |1-3|, |1-3| + |1-1|, |3-3| + |3-3|, |3-3| + |3-3| \} = \{ 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0 \} = \{ 0, 2 \}
  \]
- The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 2.

However, the optimal solution for \(n = 3\) should include three points to achieve the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\):
- A possible optimal arrangement is:
  ```
  2 1
  2 3
  3 1
  ```
- The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is:
  \[
  \mathcal{H} = \{ |2-2| + |1-1|, |2-2| + |3-3|, |3-3| + |1-1|, |2-2| + |1-3|, |2-3| + |1-1|, |2-3| + |3-1| \} = \{ 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 3 \} = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3 \}
  \]
- The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 4.

Since the program does not generate the optimal set of points for \(n > 2\), it fails to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) in general, making the program incorrect.
