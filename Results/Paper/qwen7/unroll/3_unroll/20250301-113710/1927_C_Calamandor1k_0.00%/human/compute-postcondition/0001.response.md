Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is the only variable that controls the loop's execution, it must be adjusted to ensure the loop can run.

3. **Adjust the state**: Given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
