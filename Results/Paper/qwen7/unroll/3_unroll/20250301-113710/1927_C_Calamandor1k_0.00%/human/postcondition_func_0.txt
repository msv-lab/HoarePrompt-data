The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two arrays `a` and `b` along with integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. It counts how many elements in `a` and `b` are less than or equal to `k/2`. If the count of such elements in both arrays meets or exceeds `k/2`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, it outputs nothing further and terminates.
