State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 500**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` within the `range(t)` function.
2. For the loop to execute, the value of `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` requires a non-negative integer as its argument.
3. Additionally, since `t` is constrained to be between 1 and 500 (inclusive), we need to ensure that `t` falls within this range.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 500.
