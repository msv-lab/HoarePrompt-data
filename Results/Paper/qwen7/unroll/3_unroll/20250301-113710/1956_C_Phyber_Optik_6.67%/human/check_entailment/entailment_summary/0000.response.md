Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix \(a\) using at most \(2n\) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns.
2. **Analysis of the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - It calculates a sum and a value `r` such that the sum is maximized and the total number of operations is no more than \(2n\).
   - The code prints the calculated sum and `n + r`.
   - It then prints a series of operations to achieve the desired sum.
3. **Verification of Operations**:
   - The operations printed seem to follow the rules: alternating between row and column permutations.
   - The first `n` operations are row permutations, setting each row to the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - The next `r` operations are column permutations, setting each column to the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic in the code, the implementation seems to correctly maximize the sum of the matrix and adhere to the operation limits.

Correctness: **True**
