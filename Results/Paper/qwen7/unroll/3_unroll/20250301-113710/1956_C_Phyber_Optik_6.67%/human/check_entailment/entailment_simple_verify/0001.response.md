### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, the size of the matrix.
   - It calculates the sum and the number of operations needed to achieve the maximum possible sum.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum is calculated by iterating through the first \( r \) rows, where \( r \) is determined such that \( n(n+1)/2 \) (the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers) is just greater than or equal to \( i \cdot n \).
   - If \( n(n+1)/2 > i \cdot n \), then \( r = i \). Otherwise, the sum is updated to include \( i \cdot n \).
   - The total sum is then printed along with the number of operations \( n + r \).

4. **Operations Execution**:
   - For the first \( n \) operations, it performs row permutations.
   - For the remaining \( r \) operations, it performs column permutations.
   - The permutations used are simply the identity permutation (1, 2, ..., n).

5. **Verification**:
   - The logic for determining the value of \( r \) seems correct because it ensures that the sum is maximized by filling the top-left triangular part of the matrix with the highest possible values.
   - However, the operations performed do not seem to align with the problem requirements. Specifically, the operations described do not actually maximize the sum of the matrix as intended.

### Detailed Analysis Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**: \( t \) test cases, each with an \( n \times n \) matrix.
- **First Operation**: The sum calculation logic is flawed. The variable `r` is set based on the condition \( n(n+1)/2 > i \cdot n \), but this does not directly translate to maximizing the sum of the matrix.
- **Row Permutations**: The first \( n \) operations are supposed to perform row permutations, setting each row to the identity permutation. This is correct.
- **Column Permutations**: The remaining \( r \) operations are supposed to perform column permutations, again setting each column to the identity permutation. This is also correct.
- **Output**: The output format is correct, but the logic for calculating the sum and the number of operations is flawed.

### Correct Approach:
- To maximize the sum, we need to fill the top-left triangular part of the matrix with the highest possible values.
- We can achieve this by performing \( n \) row permutations to set the first \( n \) rows to the identity permutation.
- Then, we can perform \( n \) column permutations to set the first \( n \) columns to the identity permutation.
- This will ensure that the top-left \( n \times n \) submatrix is filled with the values 1 through \( n^2 \).

### Correct Implementation:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(n * (n + 1) // 2, 2 * n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, j, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is incorrect because the provided solution does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix. The correct approach involves setting both rows and columns to the identity permutation, ensuring the top-left \( n \times n \) submatrix is filled with the highest possible values.

**Final: False**
