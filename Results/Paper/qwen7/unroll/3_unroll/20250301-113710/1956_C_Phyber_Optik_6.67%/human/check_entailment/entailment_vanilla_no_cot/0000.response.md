Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Sum:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the sum of the matrix based on the number of rows and columns, but it does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum using the allowed operations.
   - Specifically, the logic `if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is flawed and does not accurately reflect the strategy to maximize the sum of the matrix.

2. **Incorrect Number of Operations:**
   - The program prints `n + r` operations, where `r` is determined incorrectly. The number of operations should be at most `2n`, but the current implementation does not ensure this constraint is met.

3. **Operation Description:**
   - The operations printed do not correctly represent the permutations needed to maximize the sum of the matrix. The program simply prints a sequence of operations without ensuring they achieve the maximum possible sum.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, one should:
- Use the first \( n \) operations to set the first row to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
- Use the next \( n \) operations to set the first column to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

This ensures that the matrix will have the maximum possible sum, which is \( n^2 \).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        # Set the first row to [1, 2, ..., n]
        print(n, n)
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, j, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        
        # Set the first column to [1, 2, ..., n]
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

This version correctly sets up the matrix to achieve the maximum sum of \( n^2 \) using exactly \( 2n \) operations.
