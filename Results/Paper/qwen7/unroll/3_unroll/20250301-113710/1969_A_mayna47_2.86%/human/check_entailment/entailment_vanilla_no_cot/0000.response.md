Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle all cases correctly. Here are the issues:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The initialization of the list `v` is redundant. It should only be initialized once.
2. **Logic for Checking Best Friends**: The condition `if v[v[v[i]]] == i:` is incorrect. This condition checks if the best friend of the best friend of `i` is `i`, which is not the correct logic for determining if two friends can attend the party together.
3. **Handling Different Cases**: The program does not correctly handle different cases, especially when there are cycles or when the structure of best friends does not allow for a solution with just 2 invitations.

To fix these issues, you need to properly identify cycles and ensure that you are correctly counting the minimum number of invitations needed. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Create a graph representation
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        graph[i].append(v[i - 1])
        graph[v[i - 1]].append(i)

    # Function to find the size of the cycle containing node x
    def dfs(x, parent, visited):
        visited[x] = True
        cycle_size = 1
        for neighbor in graph[x]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                cycle_size += dfs(neighbor, x, visited)
            elif neighbor != parent:
                return float('inf')
        return cycle_size

    # Initialize visited array
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    min_invitations = float('inf')

    # Check each friend to see if it's part of a cycle
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycle_size = dfs(i, -1, visited)
            if cycle_size >= 2:
                min_invitations = min(min_invitations, 2)
            else:
                min_invitations = min(min_invitations, cycle_size)

    print(min_invitations)
```

This corrected program handles all cases correctly by identifying cycles and ensuring that the minimum number of invitations is calculated accurately.
