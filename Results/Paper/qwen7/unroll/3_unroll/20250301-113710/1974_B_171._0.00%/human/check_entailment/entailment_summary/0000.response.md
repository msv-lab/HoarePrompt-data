Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to decode an encoded string by creating a mapping of characters from the encoded string to the corresponding characters in the alphabet. However, there are several issues with the logic used in the `func_1` function:

1. **Incorrect Mapping Logic**: The function tries to find the next available lowercase Latin letter for each character in the encoded string, but it does not correctly reverse the encoding process. Instead of mapping each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted unique characters, it maps each character to the next available letter in the alphabet.

2. **Incorrect Decoding Process**: The function appends the next available lowercase Latin letter to the `decoded` list whenever a character is encountered that hasn't been seen before. This does not follow the required encoding/decoding logic where each character should be mapped to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted unique characters.

Given the execution summary, the function is not performing the required decoding process. It is instead generating a string of all lowercase Latin letters in order, which is not the intended behavior for decoding the encoded string.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, you need to correctly map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted unique characters. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = func_1(encoded)
        print(decoded)

def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Create a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    # Create a mapping from each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart
    mapping = {char: unique_chars[len(unique_chars) - 1 - i] for i, char in enumerate(unique_chars)}
    # Decode the encoded string using the mapping
    decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    return decoded
```

This corrected version creates a mapping from each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted unique characters and then uses this mapping to decode the string correctly.
