You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a string containing all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z' in order. It decodes the input string by mapping each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter and constructs a new string with these letters in the order they appear in the mapping. If a character in `encoded` has not been mapped yet, it assigns the next available lowercase Latin letter to it.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string according to the problem description. Specifically, the program generates a mapping for each character in the encoded string without considering the reverse symmetry required for decoding. Here's an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the encoded string `encoded = "serofedsoc"`. According to the problem description, the auxiliary string `r` should be `"cdefors"`, and the decoding process should replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding symmetric character from `r`.

However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not generate the correct mapping. It simply appends characters to the `decoded` list without ensuring that the mapping is symmetric. For instance, in the given example, the character `'s'` in the encoded string should map to `'c'` in the decoded string, but the program incorrectly maps it to `'f'`.

To fix this, the program needs to construct the auxiliary string `r` and then create a symmetric mapping. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = func_1(encoded)
        print(decoded)

def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Create the auxiliary string r
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded), key=encoded.index))
    
    # Create the symmetric mapping
    mapping = {char: r[-i-1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    
    # Decode the encoded string
    decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    return decoded
```

This corrected version ensures that the auxiliary string `r` is constructed correctly and that the symmetric mapping is properly established, thus correctly decoding the encoded string.
