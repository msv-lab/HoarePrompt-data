Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `mapping` is an empty dictionary; `decoded` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `decoded`. This does not affect the values of `encoded` or `mapping`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of `encoded` and `mapping`, while adding that `decoded` is now an empty list.
