Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates on predefined lists A, D, and F, where A is a list of n strictly increasing integers, D is a sorted list of unique integers, and F is a list of k positive integers. The function returns a specific value based on the relationships and constraints between these lists.**

This means the function `func_6` does not take any parameters when called directly. Instead, it uses three predefined lists: `A`, `D`, and `F`. The list `A` contains `n` strictly increasing integers, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers, and `F` is a list of `k` positive integers. The function then processes these lists according to the given constraints and relationships and returns a specific value based on the operations performed on these lists.
