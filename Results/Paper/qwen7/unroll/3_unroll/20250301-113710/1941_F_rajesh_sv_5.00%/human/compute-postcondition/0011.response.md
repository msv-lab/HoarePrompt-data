Output State: `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in the list `A` starting from index 1 to `n-1`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements under the same condition, `index` remains the index of the element where `max_diff` occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)` for each `f` in `F` where `l` is determined by the binary search process described in the loop, and the states of `D`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `F` remain unchanged.
