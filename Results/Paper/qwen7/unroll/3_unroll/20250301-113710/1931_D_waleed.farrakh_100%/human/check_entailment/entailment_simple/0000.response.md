Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array based on specific conditions involving two integers \(x\) and \(y\).
2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function processes each test case individually.
   - It uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of pairs \((rx, ry)\) where \(rx = (-a \% x + x) \% x\) and \(ry = a \% y\).
   - For each element \(a\) in the array, it calculates these values and checks if they exist in the frequency dictionary. If they do, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.
   - The logic correctly implements the conditions for a pair to be considered beautiful.
3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, parsing multiple test cases.
   - It constructs the `test_cases` list containing tuples of \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the corresponding array.
   - It then calls `func_1` to process each test case and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.
   - The overall flow and logic are correct for reading input and processing test cases.
4. **Overall Program Flow**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
   - There are no logical errors or missing steps in the implementation.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
