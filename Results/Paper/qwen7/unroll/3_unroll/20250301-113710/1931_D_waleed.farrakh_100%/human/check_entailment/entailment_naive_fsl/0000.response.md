Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. Let's break down the solution:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It iterates through each element in the array and calculates the remainders when divided by `x` and `y`.
   - It uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of how many times each pair of remainders has been seen.
   - For each element, it checks if the pair of remainders has been seen before and increments the count accordingly.
   - This ensures that all pairs `(i, j)` where `1 <= i < j <= n` and both conditions (`a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`) are met are counted.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are printed out for each test case.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the program correctly handles all potential cases. Hereâ€™s a quick verification using the example provided in the problem statement:

- For the input:
  ```
  6 5 2
  1 2 7 4 9 6
  ```
  The beautiful pairs are:
  - `<1, 5>`: `a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10` (divisible by 5) and `a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8` (divisible by 2).
  - `<4, 6>`: `a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10` (divisible by 5) and `a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2` (divisible by 2).

  The program correctly counts these pairs and outputs `2`.

Since the program correctly implements the logic and handles all edge cases, the correctness is **True**.
