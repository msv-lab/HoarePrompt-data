Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly implements the logic for finding the number of beautiful pairs in the array.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes each test case.
   - It initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of the occurrences of pairs `(a % x, a % y)` and a counter `count` to accumulate the number of beautiful pairs.
   - For each element `a` in the array:
     - It calculates `rx` and `ry` using modulo operations.
     - If the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`, it adds the count from `freq` to `count`.
     - It updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` from the input data.
   - It appends the test case details to `test_cases`.
   - It calls `func_1` with `test_cases` and prints the results.

### Verification of Logic:

1. **Modulo Operations**:
   - The use of `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is always non-negative.
   - The use of `a % y` directly calculates `ry`.

2. **Pair Calculation**:
   - The pair `(rx, ry)` is used to check if there are any previous occurrences of such pairs in the array.
   - If a pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`, it means there was a previous element that could form a beautiful pair with the current element.

3. **Frequency Update**:
   - The frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` is updated in `freq` to ensure that future checks are accurate.

4. **Output**:
   - The results are printed correctly after processing all test cases.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
