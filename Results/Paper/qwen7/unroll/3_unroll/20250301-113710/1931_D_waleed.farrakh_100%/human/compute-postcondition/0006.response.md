Output State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. The length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`. For each tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. `idx` is `t * 2 + 1`.
