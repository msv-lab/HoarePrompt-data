Output State: **`data` is a list containing the lines from `input().splitlines()`, `t` is the first line of `data` converted to an integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and `arr` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[0])` assigns the first line of the `data` list (after splitting the input into lines) to the variable `t` as an integer. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
