### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `freq` is a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - `count` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`:
     - Calculate `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x` to ensure it is non-negative.
     - Calculate `ry` as `a % y`.
     - Check if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`. If it does, add the count from `freq` to `count`.
     - Update the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

3. **Return Statement**:
   - After processing all elements in the array, append the final `count` to `results`.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - Append the test case details to `test_cases`.

2. **Calling `func_1` and Printing Results**:
   - Call `func_1` with `test_cases` and store the results.
   - Print each result in `results`.

#### Annotated Code:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points, confirming that the logic is implemented as described.

#### Verification of Logic:
1. **Modulo Operations**:
   - The use of `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is always non-negative.
   - The use of `a % y` directly calculates `ry`.

2. **Pair Calculation**:
   - The pair `(rx, ry)` is used to check if there are any previous occurrences of such pairs in the array.
   - If a pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`, it means there was a previous element that could form a beautiful pair with the current element.

3. **Frequency Update**:
   - The frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` is updated in `freq` to ensure that future checks are accurate.

4. **Output**:
   - The results are printed correctly after processing all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given problem description. The annotated code confirms that the program follows the intended logic accurately.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The program is correct.
