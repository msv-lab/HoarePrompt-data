### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step to confirm the correctness of the program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of the occurrences of pairs `(a % x, a % y)` and a counter `count` to accumulate the number of beautiful pairs.
   - **Modulo Operations**: The use of `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is always non-negative. The use of `a % y` directly calculates `ry`.
   - **Pair Calculation**: For each element `a` in the array, the function calculates `rx` and `ry` and checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`. If it does, it adds the count from `freq` to `count`.
   - **Frequency Update**: The function updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq` to ensure that future checks are accurate.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Reading**: The function reads the input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - **Test Case Processing**: It reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` from the input data.
   - **Calling `func_1`**: It appends the test case details to `test_cases` and calls `func_1` with `test_cases`.
   - **Output**: The function prints the results from `func_1` for each test case.

### Verification of Logic:

1. **Modulo Operations**:
   - The use of `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is always non-negative.
   - The use of `a % y` directly calculates `ry`.

2. **Pair Calculation**:
   - The pair `(rx, ry)` is used to check if there are any previous occurrences of such pairs in the array.
   - If a pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`, it means there was a previous element that could form a beautiful pair with the current element.

3. **Frequency Update**:
   - The frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` is updated in `freq` to ensure that future checks are accurate.

4. **Output**:
   - The results are printed correctly after processing all test cases.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed correct.
