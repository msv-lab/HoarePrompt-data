Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The only object being iterated over here is `result`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `results`**: According to the given information, `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`. However, since we are focusing on the state before the loop starts, we need to consider what `results` might contain at that point.

3. **Understand the structure of `test_cases`**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. Each `arr` is a list of `n` integers. The value of `idx` is `2 * t + 1`.

4. **Determine the state of `results` before the loop starts**: Since `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`, and we don't have the exact implementation of `func_1`, we need to consider the general nature of `results`. Typically, `results` would be a list containing the output of `func_1` for each test case in `test_cases`.

5. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute, `results` must be a non-empty list because the loop iterates over each element in `results`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `results` is a non-empty list.

Given these considerations, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that `results` is a non-empty list.

**State:**
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
- Each `arr` is a list of `n` integers.
- `idx` is `2 * t + 1`.
- `results` is a non-empty list (since the loop iterates over each element in `results`).

Thus, the final state is:

**State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, each `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `idx` is `2 * t + 1`, and `results` is a non-empty list**.
