Output State: **The output state will be the same as the initial execution state because the loop only prints the results from the `results` list without modifying any variables. The `results` list is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`, and the loop simply iterates over and prints its contents. No new values are assigned or variables are altered within the loop.**
