### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `p_0`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s respectively.

2. **Key Logic**:
   - The expression inside the list comprehension calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win.
   - The formula used is: `sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3`
     - `x // 2` gives the integer division of the count by 2, which means it counts pairs of the same number.
     - `x % 2` gives the remainder when divided by 2, which means it counts the odd counts of the numbers.
     - Multiplying by 3 and adding the condition `(i < 3)` ensures that 1s, 2s, and 3s are considered correctly.
     - Summing these values and dividing by 3 gives the maximum number of times Bob can win.

3. **Explanation of the Formula**:
   - For each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4):
     - If the count is even, it contributes `x // 2` to the sum.
     - If the count is odd, it contributes `x // 2 + 1` to the sum.
     - The condition `(i < 3)` ensures that only 1s, 2s, and 3s are considered, as 4s do not affect the result since their XOR is always 0.
   - Dividing the total sum by 3 gives the final result.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case on a separate line.

Given the problem statement and the annotated explanation, the provided logic correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem.
