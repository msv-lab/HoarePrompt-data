Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases, each defined by four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates a value based on these counts using a specific formula, then divides the result by 3 and prints the outcome. The function processes up to 10,000 test cases.**
