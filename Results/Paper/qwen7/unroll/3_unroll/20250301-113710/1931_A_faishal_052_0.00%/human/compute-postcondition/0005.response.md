Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where for each case, it reads two values: `cases` (the number of test cases) and `lex` (an integer). For each test case, it calculates and prints three lowercase letters. The first two letters are always 'a' and 'z', and the third letter is determined by the value of `lex % 26`, converted to a corresponding lowercase letter. The function does not return any value but outputs the calculated letters for each test case.**
