Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program attempts to decode the integer `lex` into a three-letter word.
   - However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. It incorrectly handles the decoding process, especially for values of `lex` greater than 26 and less than 52.
   - The program assumes that `lex` can be directly split into parts of 26, which is not always true. For example, for `lex = 27`, it should be split as 26 + 1, but the current logic treats it as 26 + 1, which is incorrect.
3. **Sorting and Output**:
   - After incorrectly splitting `lex`, the program sorts the array and prints the characters corresponding to the indices.
   - The sorting step is unnecessary and does not help in finding the lexicographically smallest word.
4. **Expected Behavior**:
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, we need to consider the smallest possible values for each letter while ensuring the sum matches `lex`.
   - The smallest possible word is "aaa" if `lex` is between 3 and 26, "aab" if `lex` is between 27 and 52, and so on.

Given these points, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the decoding process and does not ensure the lexicographically smallest word is found.

Correctness: **False**
