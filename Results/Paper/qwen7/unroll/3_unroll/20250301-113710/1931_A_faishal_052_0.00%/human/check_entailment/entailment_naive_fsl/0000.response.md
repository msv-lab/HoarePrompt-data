Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the encoded value is less than or equal to 26. In such cases, it incorrectly appends 1 or 26 to the array `arr` instead of correctly determining the smallest possible letters.

For example, consider the test case where the encoded value is 3. The lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded is "aaa". However, the program will incorrectly output "aav" because it does not properly handle the case where the remaining value after the first two letters is less than or equal to 26.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly determine the smallest possible letters for the remaining value after the first two letters. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        arr = [1, 1, 1]
        for j in range(2, -1, -1):
            if lex >= 27:
                arr[j] = 26
                lex -= 26
            else:
                arr[j] = lex
                lex = 0
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        print()

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the smallest possible letters are chosen for each position in the word, ensuring the lexicographically smallest word is produced for any valid encoded value.
