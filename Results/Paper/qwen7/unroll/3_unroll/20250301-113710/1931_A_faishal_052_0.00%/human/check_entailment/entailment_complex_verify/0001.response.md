### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that can be encoded to a given integer `n`.
   - The encoding is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
   - The word must consist of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `lex`.
   - It then tries to construct the word by appending letters to the list `arr` based on certain conditions:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 'a' (position 1).
     - If `lex` is between 27 and 51, it appends 'z' (position 26).
     - Otherwise, it appends 'z' again.
   - After constructing the list `arr`, it sorts it and prints the corresponding letters.

3. **Issues with the Code:**
   - The logic for constructing the word is flawed. It does not correctly handle the encoding process.
   - The code does not ensure that the constructed word is the lexicographically smallest possible word for the given encoded value.
   - The sorting step is unnecessary and incorrect since it does not reflect the actual encoding process.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start from the smallest possible letters and adjust the remaining value accordingly.
   - We should subtract the largest possible values first to minimize the letters used.

5. **Analyzed Code:**
   - The annotated code explains that the function constructs a list `arr` and then sorts it, which is not aligned with the encoding process.
   - The logic for constructing the word is incorrect because it does not ensure the smallest lexicographical order.

6. **Corrected Code:**
   - The original assessment suggested a corrected approach, which involves starting from the smallest possible letters and adjusting the remaining value.
   - The corrected code provided in the original assessment is:
     ```python
     def func():
         cases = int(input())
         for i in range(cases):
             lex = int(input())
             result = ['a', 'a', 'a']
             for j in range(3):
                 if lex >= 26:
                     result[2 - j] = chr((lex - 1) % 26 + 97)
                     lex -= (lex - 1) % 26 + 1
                 else:
                     result[2 - j] = chr(lex + 96)
                     break
             print(''.join(result))
     ```

### Evaluation:
- The provided code does not correctly implement the lexicographically smallest word construction.
- The original assessment suggested a corrected approach, which is different from the provided code.
- The annotated code and the original assessment both indicate that the provided code is incorrect.

### Final Decision:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly construct the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded value.
