Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two values, t and n, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and n is an integer between 3 and 78. The function returns a result based on these values without directly using them as input parameters.**

Note: The actual processing logic is not described here as per the instructions.
