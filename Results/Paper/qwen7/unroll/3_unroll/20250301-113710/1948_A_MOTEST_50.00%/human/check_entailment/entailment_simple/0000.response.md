### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating a string of uppercase Latin letters where exactly `n` characters are special. A character is considered special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` is designed to handle multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
   - It then checks if `n` is 1. If so, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string of length 1.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, it constructs a string `ans` with special characters according to the rules:
     - If `n` is even, it creates pairs of distinct characters from 'A' to 'Z' until it reaches `n/2` pairs.
     - If `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA' and then continues with pairs of distinct characters from 'C' to 'Z' until it reaches `(n-3)/2` pairs.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the case when `n` is 1 correctly by printing "NO".
   - For even `n`, the constructed string will have exactly `n` special characters.
   - For odd `n`, the constructed string will also have exactly `n` special characters.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The output format is correct: "YES" followed by the generated string for valid cases, and "NO" for invalid cases.
   - The length of the generated string does not exceed 200, which is within the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to generate a string with exactly `n` special characters for each test case. It handles both even and odd values of `n` appropriately and follows the required output format.

### Correctness:
**True**
