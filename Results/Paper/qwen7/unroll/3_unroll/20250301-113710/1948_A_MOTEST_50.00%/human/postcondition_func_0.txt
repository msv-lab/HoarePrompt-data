The function processes a series of test cases (up to 50) where for each case, it reads an integer `n` (between 1 and 50). Depending on whether `n` is even or odd, it prints 'YES' followed by a specific string `ans`. If `n` is even, `ans` consists of pairs of uppercase letters from 'A' to 'Z' up to half the value of `n`. If `n` is odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' followed by pairs of letters from 'C' to 'Z' up to `n-3`. After processing all test cases, it clears the screen and outputs the results for each case.
