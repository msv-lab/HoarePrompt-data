State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, _ is now 1** 

Explanation:
- The variable `_` is a common convention used as a throwaway variable when the value inside the loop is not needed. It is initialized by the `range(t)` function call.
- The variable `t` determines how many times the loop will execute. For the loop to start executing, `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- The underscore `_` is automatically set to 0 at the beginning of the loop, and it increments by 1 with each iteration. Therefore, before the first iteration, `_` is 0, but it will be 1 at the start of the first iteration.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range, and `_` is now 1 at the start of the loop.
