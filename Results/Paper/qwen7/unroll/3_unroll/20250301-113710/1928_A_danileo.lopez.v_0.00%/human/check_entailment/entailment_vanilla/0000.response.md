### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from an \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, it is possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle. This is because at least one of the dimensions is even, allowing for such a cut.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it is not possible to form a new rectangle since cutting an odd dimension results in two smaller odd dimensions, and rearranging them does not produce a different rectangle.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that a new rectangle can be formed.
   - If the condition is false, it prints 'No', indicating that no new rectangle can be formed.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in the program correctly identifies whether a new rectangle can be formed based on the parity (odd/even nature) of the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The program handles all test cases as per the problem statement.
   - The program outputs 'Yes' for cases where a new rectangle can be formed (i.e., when at least one of \(a\) or \(b\) is even) and 'No' for cases where no new rectangle can be formed (i.e., when both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd).

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

**Correctness: True**
