Output State: The output consists of 't' lines, each containing either 'Yes' or 'No'. For each iteration of the loop, if either 'a' or 'b' is even, the output is 'Yes', otherwise it is 'No'. Since 't' is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, there will be exactly 't' lines of output, alternating based on the parity of 'a' and 'b'.
