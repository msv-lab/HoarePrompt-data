Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and reassembling them.
2. The provided solution checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If either dimension is even, it prints 'Yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. If both dimensions are odd, it prints 'No'.
3. This logic is correct because:
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with at least one even dimension, allowing reassembly into a different rectangle.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the smallest possible resulting rectangles after cutting will also be odd, and thus cannot form a different rectangle without rotation, which is considered the same.
4. The provided code correctly implements this logic for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
