Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum score for the given problem. Specifically, the logic for adjusting the counts of cards after buying new ones is flawed. 

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3 4
6 1 8
```

Expected output:
```
22
```

However, the program outputs:
```
15
```

The issue lies in how the program updates the counts of cards after purchasing new ones. The current implementation does not correctly handle the scenario where buying new cards can improve the score by aligning more subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

A correct approach would involve dynamically updating the counts and checking the potential improvements after each purchase. The current solution does not fully account for these dynamic adjustments, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
