You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Example

Input

    2
    
    6
    
    1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
    
    800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
    
    6
    
    4 5 6 7 8 9
    
    1 2 3 4 5 6

Output

    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        i = 0
        for j in range(n):
            if b[j] < a[i]:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        print(cnt)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( t \) (the number of test cases), a positive integer \( n \) (the size of lists \( a \) and \( b \)), and two sorted lists \( a \) and \( b \) of length \( n \). It then counts and prints the number of times an element in list \( b \) is less than the corresponding element in list \( a \) for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the array `a` of current difficulties, and the array `b` of expected difficulties.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to count the number of new problems needed.
   - It also initializes an index `i` to iterate through the array `a`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates over the array `b` using index `j`.
   - For each element in `b`, it checks if the corresponding element in `a` is less than the current element in `b`.
   - If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means the current difficulty of the problem is more than expected, so it increments the counter `cnt` and moves to the next element in `a` (by incrementing `i`).
   - If `b[j] >= a[i]`, it means the current difficulty meets or exceeds the expected difficulty, so it just moves to the next element in `b` without changing `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements in `b`, it prints the counter `cnt`, which represents the minimum number of new problems needed.

### Correctness Check

To verify the correctness, let's consider the examples provided:

#### Example 1:
- `n = 6`
- `a = [1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200, 2700]`
- `b = [800, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2200, 3000]`

- The program will find that `a[0] > b[0]`, so it increments `cnt` and moves to the next element in `a`.
- Then it finds `a[1] > b[1]`, so it increments `cnt` again and moves to the next element in `a`.
- Finally, it finds `a[4] <= b[4]`, so it stops here.

Thus, `cnt = 2`, which matches the expected output.

#### Example 2:
- `n = 6`
- `a = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
- `b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`

- The program will find that `a[0] > b[0]`, `a[1] > b[1]`, `a[2] > b[2]`, `a[3] > b[3]`, `a[4] > b[4]`, and `a[5] > b[5]`, so it increments `cnt` six times.

Thus, `cnt = 3`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of new problems needed to ensure that `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i`. Therefore, the program is correct.
