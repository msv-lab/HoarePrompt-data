Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `_`, which is a placeholder used to iterate over the range of values returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a non-negative integer. Since the input is expected to be a positive integer (as per the constraints), the loop will always execute at least once.

3. **Adjust the State**: Given that the loop will always execute at least once, we need to ensure that the initial state allows the loop to proceed. Specifically, we need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is a valid positive integer within the given constraints.

4. **Initial State Before the Loop**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that the first input to `int(input())` will be a value within this range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is the value of `t` such that it is a positive integer within the specified range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
