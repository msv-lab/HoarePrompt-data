Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. It then determines the number of distinct values in the list that are greater than both the smallest and second smallest values found in the list. For each test case, it prints the count of such distinct values.**
