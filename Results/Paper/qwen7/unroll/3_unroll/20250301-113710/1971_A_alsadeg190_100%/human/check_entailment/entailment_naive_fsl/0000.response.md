Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. The function `func()` reads the number of test cases but only processes one test case inside the loop. It should process each test case separately within the loop. Here is an example where the program fails:

For the input:
```
2
1 9
8 4
```

The expected output is:
```
1 9
4 8
```

However, the program will produce:
```
1 9
8 4
```

This happens because the program only processes the last test case in the loop. To fix this, the program should read and process each test case individually within the loop. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
```

With this correction, the program will correctly handle multiple test cases.
