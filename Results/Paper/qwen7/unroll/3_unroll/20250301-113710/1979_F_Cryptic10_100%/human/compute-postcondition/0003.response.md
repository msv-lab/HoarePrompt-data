Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `t` and `n`.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers `t` and `n`, and returns a specific output for each case. However, since the exact nature of the return value is not specified, the focus remains on the parameters implied to be processed within the function.
