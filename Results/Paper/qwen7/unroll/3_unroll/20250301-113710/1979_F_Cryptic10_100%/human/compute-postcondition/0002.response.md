Output State: **t tests are performed. For each test, two permutations p1 and p2 are printed such that p1 is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n-2, and p2 is a permutation of numbers n-1 and n. The operations to transform the initial set vx into these permutations are recorded in ops and applied in reverse order to generate p1 and p2.**

This description captures the essence of what happens within the loop: the loop processes a set of numbers, performs operations based on user input, and then reconstructs two permutations from the operations performed.
