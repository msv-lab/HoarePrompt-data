Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is called without any parameters, but it expects the test case number (`ppp`) as an argument. This should be corrected to handle the test cases properly.

2. **Array Construction**: The logic to construct the `arr` array is flawed. It incorrectly appends ranges where the element changes, but it doesn't ensure that the ranges are within the query bounds. Also, appending `-1` at the end of `nums` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Binary Search Usage**: The binary search (`bisect_left`) is used to find the starting index of the range that intersects with the query bounds. However, the logic to determine the indices `i` and `j` from the found range is incorrect. Specifically, the conditions to check if `s > l`, `e >= r`, etc., are not correctly implemented to ensure that the chosen indices satisfy the problem constraints.

4. **Output Formatting**: The output format is correct, but the logic to determine the indices `i` and `j` needs to be fixed.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from bisect import bisect_left

def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    queries = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = map(int, input().split())
        queries.append((l, r))

    # Find all distinct element ranges
    distinct_ranges = []
    last_val = None
    start = 0
    for i, val in enumerate(nums):
        if val != last_val:
            if i > start:
                distinct_ranges.append((start, i - 1, last_val))
            start = i
            last_val = val
    if start < N:
        distinct_ranges.append((start, N - 1, last_val))

    # Process each query
    for l, r in queries:
        left_idx = bisect_left(distinct_ranges, (l, float('inf')))
        right_idx = bisect_left(distinct_ranges, (r, float('inf')))

        if left_idx == right_idx:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            (s, e, val) = distinct_ranges[left_idx]
            if s < l:
                print(l, min(e, r))
            else:
                print(-1, -1)

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the distinct ranges of elements are correctly identified and processed for each query, ensuring that the output meets the problem requirements.
