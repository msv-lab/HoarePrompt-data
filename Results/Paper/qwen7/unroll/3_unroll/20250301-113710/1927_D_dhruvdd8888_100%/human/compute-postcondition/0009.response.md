Output State: `s` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of tuples, `N` is an integer input from stdin, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `e` is 0, `num` is the last element of `nums`, `nums` is now `[num, -1]`.

Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = N`. For each iteration, if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, it appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to `arr` and updates `s` to `i`. After the loop, `num` is set to the last element of `nums`, and `nums` is updated to `[num, -1]`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `arr`, `N`, and `e` remain unchanged.
