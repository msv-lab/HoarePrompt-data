Output State: **The output state will consist of a series of pairs of integers (-1, -1) or (s, e+1), depending on the conditions inside the loop. Each pair represents the result of processing one input line given by the user, where each line provides two integers l and r. The actual values of s and e will vary based on the contents of the arr list and the positions determined by bisect_left function.**

This output state describes the results of processing multiple inputs, with each input leading to either (-1, -1) if certain conditions are met, or (s, e+1) otherwise, where s and e are determined by the binary search and list elements in arr.
