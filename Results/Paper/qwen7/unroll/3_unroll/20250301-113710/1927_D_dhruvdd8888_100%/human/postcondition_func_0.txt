The function processes a predefined set of variables: an integer `t` within the range 1 to 10^4, an integer `n` within the range 2 to 2 * 10^5, a list `a` of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, and an integer `q` within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5. Each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The function constructs an array `arr` that records changes in the elements of `nums`. It then handles `q` queries, each defined by `l` and `r`, to determine the start (`s`) and end (`e`) indices of a subarray within `a` that meets certain conditions. For each query, it outputs either a pair of indices `(s, e+1)` or `(-1, -1)` based on whether the subarray from `l` to `r-1` meets specific criteria.
