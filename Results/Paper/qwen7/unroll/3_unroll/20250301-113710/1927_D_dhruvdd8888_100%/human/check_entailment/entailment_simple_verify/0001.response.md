### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding pairs of different elements within a specified subarray for multiple queries. If no such pair exists, the output should be `-1 -1`.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`N`), the array itself, and the number of queries (`q`).
   - It then processes the array to identify segments where consecutive elements are the same.
   - For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that covers the query range and then determines if there are different elements within that segment.

3. **Key Points to Verify**:
   - **Segment Identification**: The code correctly identifies segments where consecutive elements are the same.
   - **Query Processing**: The code uses binary search to find the relevant segment and checks if the segment boundaries cover the query range.
   - **Output Handling**: The code handles cases where no different elements are found within the query range.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Segments**: The code correctly handles segments with only one element.
   - **No Different Elements**: The code correctly outputs `-1 -1` when no different elements are found.
   - **Boundary Conditions**: The code correctly handles boundary conditions for the query ranges.

5. **Algorithm Correctness**:
   - The approach of identifying segments and using binary search to find relevant segments is sound.
   - The handling of edge cases and boundary conditions appears to be correct.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic flow.
   - The use of `bisect_left` to find the relevant segment is appropriate.
   - The conditions for printing the results are correctly handled.

7. **Specific Issues**:
   - The code appends `-1` to `nums` to simplify the segment identification, which is a good optimization.
   - The logic for determining the output based on the segment boundaries is correct.
   - The handling of the `LA` variable and the segment boundaries is accurate.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code and the annotated version, the original assessment is accurate. The code correctly implements the solution for the problem statement, handling all edge cases and query ranges appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
