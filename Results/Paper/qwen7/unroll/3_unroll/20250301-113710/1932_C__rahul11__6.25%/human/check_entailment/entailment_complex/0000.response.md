Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes the `MOD` value as \(10^9 + 6\).
2. It iterates over each test case as expected, reading the necessary inputs for each case.
3. The product of the array elements is calculated initially and stored in `ans`.
4. The program correctly handles the division by elements based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
5. The result array `res` is updated with the remainder of the product after each operation.
6. The program prints the results for each test case as required.

Given the annotations and the logic of the code, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately. It correctly processes each command and updates the product and result array accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
