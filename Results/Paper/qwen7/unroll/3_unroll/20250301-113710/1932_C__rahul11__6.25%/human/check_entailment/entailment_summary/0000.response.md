Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes the product `ans` with the full product of the array `arr`.
2. It then iterates through the commands in the string `s` and updates the product `ans` accordingly.
3. If the command is 'L', it divides the product by the leftmost element and removes that element from consideration.
4. If the command is 'R', it divides the product by the rightmost element and removes that element from consideration.
5. The results are stored in the `res` array, which is printed at the end of each test case.
6. The program handles the division by using modulo `MOD` to avoid overflow issues, which is a good practice for large numbers.

Given the execution summary and the provided reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. There are no apparent errors in the logic or implementation based on the provided information.

Correctness: **True**
