You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

    Anna
    Sasha
    
Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the rules and logic of the game described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the list `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers.

2. **Reversal of Elements:**
   - The program reverses the digits of each element in the list.
   - If the reversed number has the same length as the original number, it appends the original number to `rev_res`.
   - Otherwise, it appends the reversed number to `rev_val`.

3. **Sorting and Concatenation:**
   - The `rev_val` list is sorted.
   - The program then concatenates the elements of `rev_val` alternately without reversing them and those that were appended to `rev_res` directly.

4. **Winning Condition Check:**
   - Finally, the program checks if the resulting number is greater than \(10^m\). If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Handling of Reversed Numbers:**
   - The program should handle the reversed numbers properly but it incorrectly appends the reversed numbers to `rev_res` instead of maintaining a separate list for them.

2. **Concatenation Logic:**
   - The program should concatenate the numbers in such a way that Sasha cannot form a number greater than \(10^m\) after Anna's move.

3. **Optimal Play Consideration:**
   - The program does not consider the optimal play strategy for both players. It only checks the final concatenated number without simulating the entire game process.

### Correct Implementation

To correctly implement the game, we need to simulate the entire game process and ensure that both players play optimally. Here is a more accurate approach:

```python
def play_game(n, m, a):
    def reverse_number(x):
        return int(str(x)[::-1])

    def sasha_move(operational_list):
        # Sasha removes two elements and concatenates them
        a_i, a_j = operational_list.pop(), operational_list.pop()
        return str(a_i) + str(a_j)

    def anna_move(operational_list):
        # Anna reverses one element
        a_i = operational_list.pop()
        return str(reverse_number(a_i))

    operational_list = [reverse_number(x) for x in a]
    turn = 'Anna'
    while len(operational_list) > 1:
        if turn == 'Anna':
            operational_list.append(anna_move(operational_list))
        else:
            operational_list.append(sasha_move(operational_list))
        turn = 'Sasha' if turn == 'Anna' else 'Anna'

    final_number = int(operational_list[0])
    if final_number >= 10**m:
        return 'Sasha'
    else:
        return 'Anna'

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(play_game(n, m, a))

func()
```

The given program does not correctly simulate the game and does not account for the optimal play strategy. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
