Output State: **The output state will consist of a series of strings representing binary numbers with possible modifications based on specific conditions within the loop. Each string will be of length up to 31 characters ('-1', '0', or '1'), and the length of the string printed at the end of each iteration will indicate the modified length of the binary representation. The exact content of each string will depend on the input provided during each iteration of the loop.**

This description captures the essence of the transformations applied to the binary representations within the loop, without specifying exact values since they depend on user inputs.
