Reasoning:
1. The program correctly converts the integer `x` into its 30-bit binary representation.
2. It then iterates through the binary string and applies the specified rules to modify the bits:
   - If there are consecutive non-zero bits, it changes the first one to '-1' and sets the next one to '0'.
   - It ensures no two consecutive non-zero bits exist.
3. The program handles edge cases where the last bit needs adjustment and ensures the final string meets the required conditions.
4. The output format matches the problem statement requirements, providing the length of the array followed by the array itself.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
