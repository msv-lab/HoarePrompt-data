Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program constructs a binary representation of `x` using a list `s` of length 30.
   - If the bit at position `i` (from right to left, starting from 0) in `x` is set (`x & pow(2, i)`), it appends `'1'` to `s`; otherwise, it appends `'0'`.

3. **Adjusting the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the list `s` to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
   - It uses a flag to track whether a change has been made in the current iteration.
   - If a change is made (flag is set to 1), it adjusts the elements accordingly:
     - If the current element is `'1'` and the previous element is `'1'`, it changes the current element to `'0'` and sets the flag.
     - If the current element is `'1'` and the previous element is `'0'`, it changes the current element to `'-'` and sets the flag.
   - After processing the list, it ensures the last element is adjusted correctly if necessary.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the array `s`.
   - It then prints the array `s`.

### Verification Against Constraints and Requirements

1. **Array Length:**
   - The array length is fixed at 30, but the problem allows lengths up to 32. This is a potential issue.

2. **Element Values:**
   - The program only uses `'1'`, `'0'`, and `'-'` to represent the elements, which aligns with the problem constraints.

3. **No Consecutive Non-Zero Elements:**
   - The program ensures that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist, which is a key requirement.

4. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program constructs the binary representation of `x` correctly, but it does not explicitly calculate the sum. Instead, it relies on the binary representation to meet the sum condition.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues

1. **Length Constraint:**
   - The program hard-codes the length to 30, which might fail for numbers that require more than 30 bits. This is a significant flaw.

2. **Handling Larger Numbers:**
   - For numbers requiring more than 30 bits, the program will not work as intended. It should dynamically adjust the length based on the number of bits required.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because it does not handle numbers that require more than 30 bits. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem's requirements for all possible inputs.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
