Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not always generate a valid array according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that there does not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_{i} \neq 0\) and \(a_{i + 1} \neq 0\). This is evident from the following example:

Consider the input \(x = 14\). The program generates the array \([0, -1, 0, 0, 1]\), which is correct. However, consider another input \(x = 18\).

For \(x = 18\), the binary representation is \(10010\). The program would generate the array \([1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\). This array is not valid because it has consecutive non-zero elements (\(1, 0, 1\)).

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements are present in the generated array. The current implementation does not enforce this constraint, leading to invalid outputs for certain inputs.
