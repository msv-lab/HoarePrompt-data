### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of fireworks from the first installation that are visible in the sky using `m // a`.
   - It calculates the number of fireworks from the second installation that are visible in the sky using `m // b`.
   - It adds 2 to the sum of these values. This addition of 2 is crucial because:
     - It accounts for the possibility of fireworks from both installations being launched at the same time (i.e., at `m` minutes).
     - It ensures that we count the fireworks launched exactly at `m` minutes correctly.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis:

- The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is derived from the principle of inclusion-exclusion.
  - `m // a` gives the number of fireworks from the first installation that are visible within `m` minutes.
  - `m // b` gives the number of fireworks from the second installation that are visible within `m` minutes.
  - Adding `2` accounts for the overlap where both installations launch fireworks at the same time (i.e., at `m` minutes).

This approach correctly handles the problem statement and the constraints provided.

### Conclusion:

The program is designed to solve the problem accurately based on the given constraints and requirements.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**
