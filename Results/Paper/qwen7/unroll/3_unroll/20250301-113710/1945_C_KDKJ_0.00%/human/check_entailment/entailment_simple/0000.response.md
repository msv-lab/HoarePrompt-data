### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling**:
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_2` is called in the main block and handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads the number of houses `n` and the preference string `a`.
   - It calculates the prefix sums of zeros and ones using the list `S`.
   - It iterates through the list `S` to find the optimal position `i` where the road should be built.
   - The conditions for satisfaction are checked:
     - `left * 2 < lsum` ensures at least half of the left-side residents are satisfied.
     - `right * 2 < rsum` ensures at least half of the right-side residents are satisfied.
   - If both conditions are met, it updates `ans` to the current index `i` if it is closer to the middle or is the smallest index when equally close.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It processes multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1` based on the number of test cases provided.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the optimal position `i` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Given Code:

- The logic in `func_1` is correct for determining the optimal position `i` based on the conditions provided.
- The implementation of `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one.
- The use of prefix sums (`S`) to efficiently calculate the number of zeros and ones on the left and right sides is appropriate and accurate.
- The conditions for checking the satisfaction of residents are correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position for the road based on the problem statement. There are no logical errors or discrepancies in the provided code.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
