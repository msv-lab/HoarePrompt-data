Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes three integers: t, n, and k. For each test case, if k is even and within the specified range, and t is a positive integer within the given bounds, the function returns specific information based on the values of n and k.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return values are not described here as per the instructions.
