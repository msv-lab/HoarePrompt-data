Functionality: **For each test case, the function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \), constructs an array from 1 to \( n \), and then generates a sequence starting with 1, followed by alternating elements from the beginning and end of the array, until the entire array is traversed. This sequence is printed for each test case.**
