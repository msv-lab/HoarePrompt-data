You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        answer = [1]
        a = [1, -1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        print(*answer)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 with k being even.

            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        
        print(*answer)
        
    #State: For each test case, the output is a sequence of numbers starting with 1, followed by alternating elements from the beginning and end of the array [1, 2, ..., n], until the entire array is traversed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly constructs a k-level permutation of length n.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The program initializes an array `array` with values from 1 to n.
   - It starts constructing the answer array with the value 1.
   - It uses a list `a` initialized with `[1, -1]` to keep track of indices to be used for constructing the answer.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop runs from 1 to `n-1` to fill the answer array.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `(-1) ** i == -1`. If true, it appends `array[a[-1]]` to the answer and decrements `a[-1]`.
   - Otherwise, it appends `array[a[0]]` to the answer and increments `a[0]`.

### Correctness Check

To check if the program constructs a k-level permutation, we need to verify if the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

#### Example Test Case: `n = 10`, `k = 4`

1. **Initial Array:**
   ```python
   array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
   ```

2. **Answer Array Construction:**
   - `i = 1`: `(-1) ** 1 == -1` → `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` → `answer.append(array[1])` → `answer = [1, 2]`
   - `i = 2`: `(-1) ** 2 == 1` → `answer.append(array[a[0]])` → `answer.append(array[2])` → `answer = [1, 2, 3]`
   - `i = 3`: `(-1) ** 3 == -1` → `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` → `answer.append(array[0])` → `answer = [1, 2, 3, 1]`
   - `i = 4`: `(-1) ** 4 == 1` → `answer.append(array[a[0]])` → `answer.append(array[4])` → `answer = [1, 2, 3, 1, 5]`
   - `i = 5`: `(-1) ** 5 == -1` → `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` → `answer.append(array[3])` → `answer = [1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 4]`
   - `i = 6`: `(-1) ** 6 == 1` → `answer.append(array[a[0]])` → `answer.append(array[6])` → `answer = [1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 7]`
   - `i = 7`: `(-1) ** 7 == -1` → `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` → `answer.append(array[5])` → `answer = [1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 7, 6]`
   - `i = 8`: `(-1) ** 8 == 1` → `answer.append(array[a[0]])` → `answer.append(array[8])` → `answer = [1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9]`
   - `i = 9`: `(-1) ** 9 == -1` → `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` → `answer.append(array[7])` → `answer = [1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8]`

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - Sums of continuous segments of length 4:
     - `1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 7`
     - `2 + 3 + 1 + 5 = 11`
     - `3 + 1 + 5 + 4 = 13`
     - `1 + 5 + 4 + 7 = 17`
     - `5 + 4 + 7 + 6 = 22`
     - `4 + 7 + 6 + 9 = 26`
     - `7 + 6 + 9 + 8 = 30`
   - Maximum sum: 30
   - Minimum sum: 7
   - Difference: 30 - 7 = 22 (which is greater than 1)

### Conclusion

The constructed permutation does not satisfy the condition that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of continuous segments of length `k` should be no more than 1. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
