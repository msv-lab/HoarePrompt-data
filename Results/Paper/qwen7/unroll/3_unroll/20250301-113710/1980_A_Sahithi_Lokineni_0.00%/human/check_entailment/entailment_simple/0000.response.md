Reasoning:

1. The provided code attempts to solve the problem but has a logical error.
2. The variable `default_value` is used in the `defaultdict` instantiation without being defined. This will cause a NameError.
3. The logic inside the loop for calculating the number of additional problems needed is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that each difficulty level should be available at least `m` times, which is not the requirement. Instead, it should ensure that there are at least `m` different difficulty levels available.
4. The current implementation only checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than `m` and adds `m - count` to the answer, which does not account for the fact that we need at least `m` different difficulty levels.

Given these issues, the provided code is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
