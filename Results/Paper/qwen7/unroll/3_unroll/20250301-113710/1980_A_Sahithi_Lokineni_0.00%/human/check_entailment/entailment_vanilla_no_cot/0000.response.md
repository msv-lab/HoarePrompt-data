Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has an issue with how it initializes and uses the `defaultdict`. The line `d = defaultdict(default_value)` is incorrect because `default_value` is not defined. Additionally, the logic for calculating the number of problems needed is flawed. The code incorrectly assumes that the number of problems needed is calculated based on the number of rounds `m`, but it does not correctly account for the distribution of problem difficulties across all rounds.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)  # Initialize with int to count occurrences
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1  # Increment the count for each difficulty level
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed
    ans = 0
    for val in d.values():
        if val < m:  # If the current difficulty level is less than required for m rounds
            ans += m - val
    
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version initializes the `defaultdict` with `int` to properly count occurrences of each difficulty level. It then calculates the shortfall for each difficulty level and sums these shortfalls to get the total number of additional problems needed.
