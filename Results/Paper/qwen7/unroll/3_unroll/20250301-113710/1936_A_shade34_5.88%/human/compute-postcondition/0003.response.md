Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data where t (the number of test cases) is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n (the size of the permutation) is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. Additionally, the function receives a permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} which is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function processes this input data and returns an output based on the given constraints and permutation.**
