Output State: The output state will consist of two integers separated by a space, representing the indices `mak2` and `mak` after all iterations of the loop have finished. These indices are determined based on the comparisons made during the execution of the loop for each test case. Specifically, `mak2` is initially set to the value of `mak` at the end of the first part of the loop, and `mak` is updated through various comparisons within the loop. The final values of `mak2` and `mak` are printed at the end of each test case.
