Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each involving a permutation of numbers from 0 to n-1. For each test case, it performs a series of comparisons using a specific query format and updates two indices, `mak2` and `mak`. After processing all test cases, it outputs two integers, `mak2` and `mak`, which represent the results of these comparisons.**
