Functionality: The function processes a series of test cases, each containing three non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value \(k\) based on specific conditions. If a certain condition involving \(b\) and \(c\) is met, it prints \(-1\) and does not update \(k\). Otherwise, \(k\) is updated by adding \(a + \frac{b + c}{3}\) and possibly adding 1 if \((b + c) \mod 3 \neq 0\). After processing all test cases, it prints the final value of \(k\) for each case.
