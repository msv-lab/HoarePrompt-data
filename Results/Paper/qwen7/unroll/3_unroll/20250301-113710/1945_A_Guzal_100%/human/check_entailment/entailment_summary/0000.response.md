Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the condition where it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Specifically, if the number of extroverts (`b`) is not divisible by 3 and the remainder plus the number of universals (`c`) is less than 3, the program correctly outputs `-1`.
2. The calculation of the number of tents required is based on the following logic:
   - Each introvert (`a`) requires 1 tent.
   - Extroverts (`b`) and universals (`c`) can share tents. Each group of 3 people (either 1 extrovert and 2 universals, or 3 universals) requires 1 tent.
   - The program calculates the number of full tents needed for the extroverts and universals by using `(b + c) // 3`, which gives the integer division of the sum by 3.
   - If there are remaining people after forming complete groups of 3, an additional tent is needed, which is checked by `(b + c) % 3 != 0`.

Given the logic and the conditions in the program match the problem description accurately, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
