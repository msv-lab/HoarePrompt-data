Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- The difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative.

The code snippet to be executed is:

```python
print('Yes')
```

This code simply prints the string `'Yes'`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` are not relevant to the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **Yes**
