Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- The condition \((n - m) \% 2 \neq 0\) or \(n - m < 0\) must be true.

The print statement is simply `print('No')`.

The condition \((n - m) \% 2 \neq 0\) means that \(n - m\) is an odd number, and the condition \(n - m < 0\) means that \(n - m\) is a negative number. Both conditions ensure that the statement inside the print function will be executed without any changes to the string 'No'.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **No**
