### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move.
- After `n` moves, the tower should have exactly `m` cubes.
- The difference between `n` and `m` must be even and non-negative.

#### Program Code Analysis:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: `kreker` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq \text{kreker} \leq 100\).
2. **Loop through Test Cases**: For each test case, the function `func_1()` is called.
3. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - **Input**: Two integers `n` and `m`.
   - **Condition Check**: 
     - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: Ensures the difference between `n` and `m` is even.
     - `n - m >= 0`: Ensures the difference is non-negative.
   - **Output**: Prints "Yes" if both conditions are met; otherwise, prints "No".

#### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness**: **False**
- **Explanation**: The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is less than `m`. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is satisfied, but `n < m`, which is not possible since Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: \( n \geq m \)
     - If \( n - m \) is even and non-negative, the program correctly prints "Yes".
   - **Case 2**: \( n < m \)
     - The program incorrectly prints "Yes" when \( n - m \) is even and non-negative, but \( n < m \).

2. **Example Test Case**:
   - **Input**: `2 4`
   - **Expected Output**: "No"
   - **Actual Output**: "Yes"
     - Here, \( n = 2 \) and \( m = 4 \).
     - \( n - m = -2 \), which is not non-negative, but the program incorrectly checks \( (-2) \% 2 == 0 \) and prints "Yes".

3. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program fails to ensure that \( n \geq m \) before checking the parity of \( n - m \).
   - The condition \( n - m \geq 0 \) should be checked first to ensure \( n \geq m \).

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is less than `m`, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
