Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a test case consisting of two positive integers n and m, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and returns a value based on the given conditions.**

Note: The provided code snippet does not include the actual logic for processing the test case, only the constraints and expected output structure. The functionality description focuses on the inputs and outputs without detailing the internal operations.
