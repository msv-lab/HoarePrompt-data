Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. This part is handled correctly by the loop `for i in range(kreker)`.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to process each test case. It reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Logic Check**: The function checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative using the condition `((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0)`. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". This logic correctly determines whether it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

4. **Output**: The function prints the result directly to the standard output, which is appropriate for the problem requirements.

5. **Preconditions and Postconditions**: 
   - **Precondition**: The precondition is that `t` (number of test cases) is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, and each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `m` such that `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100`.
   - **Postcondition**: After processing each test case, the program should print "Yes" if it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves, and "No" otherwise.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
