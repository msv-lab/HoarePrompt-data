You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b, where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, where each line contains the result of the calculation based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case. If `b <= a`, it prints `n * a`. If `b - a >= n`, it prints `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, it prints `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three positive integers: n, a, and b. It calculates the total cost of buying n buns where the first bun is sold at a price of b and all subsequent buns are sold at a usual price of a. The function does not return anything explicitly but performs the calculation for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
