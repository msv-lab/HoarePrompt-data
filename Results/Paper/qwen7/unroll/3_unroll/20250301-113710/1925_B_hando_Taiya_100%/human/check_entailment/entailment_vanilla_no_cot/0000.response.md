Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Function `func_1` is not called with the correct parameters**: The function `func_1` is defined but never called with the correct parameters from the main loop. Instead of calling `func_1()` inside the loop, you should call the function with the values of `x` and `n` directly.

2. **Incorrect logic for calculating the GCD (balance)**: The current logic checks only the divisors of `x` and does not ensure that the difficulties sum up to `x`. Additionally, the logic for finding the maximum balance needs to consider all possible ways to split `x` into `n` parts.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd, isqrt

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    x, n = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if x % n == 0:
            diff = x // n
            ans = max(ans, diff)
        else:
            for j in range(1, isqrt(n) + 1):
                if n % j == 0:
                    diff1 = x // j
                    diff2 = x // (n // j)
                    if diff1 >= diff2 and diff1 >= diff:
                        ans = max(ans, diff1)
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the corrected code:
- **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases and then process each test case.
- **Finding Maximum Balance**: For each test case, iterate over possible numbers of sub-problems (`i`). If `x` is divisible by `n`, then each sub-problem has a difficulty of `x // n`.
- **Optimal Splitting**: If `x` is not perfectly divisible by `n`, check all pairs of factors `(j, n // j)` and calculate the corresponding difficulties. Ensure that the difficulties are at least as large as the previous best difficulty found.
- **Output**: Print the maximum balance found for each test case.

This approach ensures that the program correctly calculates the maximum balance for the given constraints.
