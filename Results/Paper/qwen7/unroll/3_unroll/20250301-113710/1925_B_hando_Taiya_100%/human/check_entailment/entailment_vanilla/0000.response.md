Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - A function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is a logical error because the function should be called within the loop to process each test case.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop iterates `tc` times, which is correct.
   - Inside the loop, it calls `func_1()`, but `func_1()` is not defined to handle the logic required for the problem. This is incorrect.

4. **Function Logic:**
   - The function `func_1()` is supposed to find the maximum balance.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `x`.
   - For each number `i`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i`.
     - If `x % i == 0`, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` and updates `ans` accordingly.
     - It also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i` and updates `ans` accordingly.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Logic for Finding Maximum Balance:**
  - The logic inside `func_1()` is correct for finding the maximum balance. It correctly checks all possible divisors of `x` and ensures that the number of sub-problems (`n`) does not exceed the divisor or the quotient.
  - The logic for updating `ans` is also correct.

- **Function Call:**
  - The main loop should call `func_1()` to process each test case. However, since `func_1()` is not being called, the program will not produce any output for the test cases.

### Conclusion:

The program is logically correct for finding the maximum balance, but it fails to call the function `func_1()` where the actual logic resides. Therefore, the program will not produce any output and will not solve the problem as intended.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
