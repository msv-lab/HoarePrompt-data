Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Odd Number of Yogurts (`n % 2`)**:
   - The program checks if `n` is odd using `if n % 2`. 
   - If `n` is odd, it compares `2 * a` with `b` to decide the minimum cost.
     - If `2 * a < b`, it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually, so it prints `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it buys `n // 2` pairs at the promotion price and the remaining one at the individual price, printing `n // 2 * b + a`.
3. **Even Number of Yogurts (`n % 2 == 0`)**:
   - If `n` is even, it directly checks if `2 * a < b` to decide the minimum cost.
     - If `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n` (buying all yogurts individually).
     - Otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b` (buying all yogurts in pairs).

Given the logic and the provided examples, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for each test case. The conditions and calculations align with the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
