Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three integers t, n, and a, and a, b within the specified ranges. It returns a result based on the value of t, where if t is 1, it returns a string indicating the relationship between n and a (e.g., "n is greater than a"), and if t is 2, it returns a string indicating the relationship between n and b (e.g., "n is less than b"). If t is outside the range [1, 10^4], it returns an error message.**
