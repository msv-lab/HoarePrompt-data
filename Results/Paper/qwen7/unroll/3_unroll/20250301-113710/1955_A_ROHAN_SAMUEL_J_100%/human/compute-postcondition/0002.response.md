Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each corresponding to the output of one test case. For each test case, if `n` is odd, it will print either `a * n` or `n // 2 * b + a`, depending on whether `2 * a < b` holds true. If `n` is even, it will print either `a * n` or `n // 2 * b`, again depending on whether `2 * a < b` holds true. The exact values printed will depend on the specific inputs provided for each test case.
