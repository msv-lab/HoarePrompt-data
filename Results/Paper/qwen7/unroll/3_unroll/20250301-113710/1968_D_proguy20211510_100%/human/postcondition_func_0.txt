The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers n, k, P_B, and P_S, a permutation p, and an array a. It then determines two paths, one starting from P_B and the other from P_S, and calculates the maximum possible sum of k consecutive elements along each path. Based on which path has the higher sum, it prints either "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".
