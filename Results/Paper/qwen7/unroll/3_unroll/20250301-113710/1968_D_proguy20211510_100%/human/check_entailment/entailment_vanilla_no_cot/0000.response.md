Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining the winner of the game:

1. **Incorrect Variable Names**: The variables `YES` and `NO` are defined but never used. The solution should use `Bodya`, `Sasha`, and `Draw` as required.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**: The scores are calculated using a formula that does not correctly simulate the game rules. Specifically, the formula `curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` and similar for `paths` does not account for the fact that the players can stay at their current position or move to the next one in each turn. Instead, it seems to assume the players will always move to the next position without considering the possibility of staying.

3. **Logic Error in Loop Conditions**: The loops that append the scores to `pathb` and `paths` do not correctly simulate the game. The condition `if k < i + 1: break` is incorrect because it breaks the loop before the full k turns are completed. The correct approach would be to ensure that the loop runs exactly k times.

4. **Missing Handling of Game Rules**: The solution does not properly handle the game rules where players can choose to stay at their current position or move to the next one. The logic should consider both possibilities for each turn.

### Corrected Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

        def simulate(start):
            score = 0
            pos = start - 1
            for _ in range(k):
                score += a[pos]
                pos = p[pos] - 1
            return score

        score_bodya = simulate(pb)
        score_sasha = simulate(ps)

        if score_bodya > score_sasha:
            print('Bodya')
        elif score_sasha > score_bodya:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected solution correctly simulates the game for each player and calculates their scores based on the given rules.
