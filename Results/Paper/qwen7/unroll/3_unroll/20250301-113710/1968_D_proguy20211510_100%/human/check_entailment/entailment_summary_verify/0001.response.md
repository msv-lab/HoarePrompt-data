### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input values for `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` and converts them to integers.
   - This part is correct.

2. **Permutation and Array Input**:
   - The program correctly reads and stores the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - This part is correct.

3. **Path Calculation for Bodya and Sasha**:
   - The program initializes two lists `pathb` and `paths` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.
   - For Bodya, it starts from `pb-1` and follows the permutation until a cycle is detected.
   - Similarly, for Sasha, it starts from `ps-1` and follows the permutation until a cycle is detected.
   - This part is correct.

4. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum possible score for Bodya and Sasha using the formula `curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` and `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`.
   - It updates the scores for Bodya and Sasha accordingly.
   - However, the score calculation logic has a flaw. The formula `curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` assumes that the player will stay at the current position for the remaining turns, which is incorrect. The player can choose to move to `p[x]` at any point, not just at the end.
   - This flaw means that the program does not correctly simulate the game's rules, as the players can strategically choose to move to different positions to maximize their scores.

5. **Output Determination**:
   - After calculating the scores, the program compares them and prints the appropriate result: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".
   - This part is correct, but it relies on the flawed score calculation logic.

### Analysis:

- The logic for parsing and storing the permutation and array is correct.
- The path calculation for both players is implemented correctly.
- The score calculation logic is incorrect because it does not account for the strategic movement of players during the game.
- The output determination is handled correctly based on the comparison of the final scores, but these scores are incorrect due to the flawed score calculation logic.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem constraints and the implementation details, the program does not correctly simulate the game's rules, leading to incorrect score calculations and potentially wrong outputs.

### Final Evaluation:

**Final: False**
