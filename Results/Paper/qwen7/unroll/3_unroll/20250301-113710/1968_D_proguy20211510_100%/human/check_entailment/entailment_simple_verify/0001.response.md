### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input values for `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` and converts them to integers.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Permutation and Array Input**:
   - The program correctly reads and stores the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - This part is also correct and matches the problem description.

3. **Path Calculation for Bodya and Sasha**:
   - The program initializes two lists `pathb` and `paths` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.
   - For Bodya, it starts from `pb-1` and follows the permutation until a cycle is detected.
   - Similarly, for Sasha, it starts from `ps-1` and follows the permutation until a cycle is detected.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

4. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum possible score for Bodya and Sasha using the formula `curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` and `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`.
   - It updates the scores for Bodya and Sasha accordingly.
   - However, the score calculation logic has a critical flaw. The formula `curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` assumes that the remaining turns are used optimally, but it does not account for the fact that the players can choose to stay at their current position or move to the next position in the permutation. The correct approach should consider all possible paths within the remaining turns, not just the last one.
   - For example, if `k` is large, the program might only consider the last segment of the path, which could lead to incorrect results.

5. **Output Determination**:
   - After calculating the scores, the program compares them and prints the appropriate result: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

### Analysis:

- The logic for parsing and storing the permutation and array is correct.
- The path calculation for both players is implemented correctly, but the score calculation logic is flawed.
- The output determination is handled correctly based on the comparison of the final scores.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment concluded that the program handles all aspects of the problem correctly. However, the score calculation logic is incorrect because it does not account for all possible paths within the remaining turns. Therefore, the program can produce incorrect results in some cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
