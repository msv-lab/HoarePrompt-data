### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` and parsing them as integers.
   - It also correctly reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Path Calculation for Bodya and Sasha**:
   - The program calculates the path and scores for Bodya and Sasha separately.
   - It uses a `vis` array to ensure that it does not revisit positions, which prevents infinite loops in cyclic permutations.
   - The paths are stored in `pathb` and `paths` for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum possible score for Bodya and Sasha using the formula `pre + path[i] * (k - i)` for each step.
   - This ensures that the score is maximized for each player by considering the remaining steps `k - i`.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - The program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

Given the above points, the program logic seems to follow the problem statement accurately. It correctly calculates the scores for both players and determines the winner based on these scores.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: **True**
