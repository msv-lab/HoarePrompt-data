Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Conditions Based on `x` and `k`:**
   - The program checks if `x < k - 1`. This condition is handled correctly.
     - If `x < k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 1`. This ensures that Sasha can cover the cost of one bet and still have enough coins to start the sequence without violating the rule of not losing more than `x` times in a row.
     - If `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 3`. This is because with `x == k - 1`, Sasha needs to ensure he can recover from losing `x` times and still have enough coins to start a new cycle.
     - If `x > k - 1`, it calculates `z` as the sum of the series where each term is the sum of the previous term divided by `(k - 1)` plus 1. This is intended to check if Sasha can accumulate enough coins to cover the required bets.

3. **Calculation of `z`:**
   - The loop `for i in range(x + 1):` iterates from 0 to `x`. 
   - Inside the loop, `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` updates `z` by adding the integer division of `z` by `(k - 1)` plus 1. This calculation is meant to simulate the growth of Sasha's coin count over multiple rounds of betting.

4. **Final Condition Check:**
   - The program prints 'YES' if Sasha can afford the required bets based on the calculated `z` and the initial number of coins `a`.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Verification Against Examples

Let's verify the program against the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `2 1 7`
   - Output: `YES`
   - Explanation: Sasha can place 1 coin each time and recover after a loss, ensuring he can eventually get more coins.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `2 1 1`
   - Output: `NO`
   - Explanation: With only 1 coin, Sasha cannot place a bet of 1 coin and still have enough to start again after a loss.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `2 3 15`
   - Output: `YES`
   - Explanation: Sasha can follow the strategy to ensure he can recover from up to 3 consecutive losses.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `3 3 6`
   - Output: `NO`
   - Explanation: With 6 coins and needing to recover from 3 consecutive losses, Sasha cannot afford the required bets.

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - Output: `NO`
   - Explanation: Similar logic as above, Sasha cannot afford the required bets.

6. **Example 6:**
   - Input: `5 4 7`
   - Output: `YES`
   - Explanation: Sasha can follow the strategy to ensure he can recover from up to 4 consecutive losses.

7. **Example 7:**
   - Input: `4 88 1000000000`
   - Output: `NO`
   - Explanation: Given the large number of consecutive losses allowed, Sasha cannot afford the required bets with the initial number of coins.

8. **Example 8:**
   - Input: `25 69 231`
   - Output: `NO`
   - Explanation: Similar logic as above.

9. **Example 9:**
   - Input: `13 97 18806`
   - Output: `NO`
   - Explanation: Similar logic as above.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve his goal based on the given constraints. The calculations and conditions are appropriately handled.

**Correctness: True**
