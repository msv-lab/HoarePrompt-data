Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the basic conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO'.
2. The logic for determining 'YES' and 'NO' is based on the provided problem description.
   - If \( x < k - 1 \) and \( a \geq x + 1 \), Sasha can ensure he wins by betting strategically.
   - If \( x = k - 1 \) and \( a \geq x + 3 \), Sasha can also ensure he wins by betting strategically.
   - Otherwise, Sasha cannot guarantee winning enough coins.
3. The program iterates over each test case and applies the correct logic.
4. The program does not return any value, which is acceptable since the problem statement does not require a return value, only printed outputs.

Given the execution summary and the problem description, the program logic matches the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
