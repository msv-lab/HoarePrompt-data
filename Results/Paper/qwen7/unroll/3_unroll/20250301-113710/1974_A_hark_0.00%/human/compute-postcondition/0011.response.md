Output: **math.ceil(x / 15)**

Explanation:
- `x` is a non-negative integer greater than 0. This means `x` is a positive integer.
- `y` is a non-negative integer equal to 0. This means `y` is 0.
- The expression `math.ceil(x / 15)` calculates the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15. Since `x` is a positive integer, dividing it by 15 will result in a floating-point number, and `math.ceil()` will round this number up to the nearest integer.

Given that `x` is a positive integer, the output will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x / 15`. However, since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical output. Therefore, the output is expressed as `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
