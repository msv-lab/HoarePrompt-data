Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_2` is flawed, particularly in how it calculates the number of screens needed for different combinations of `x` and `y`.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for `bxsfory`:**
   - The calculation `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` is intended to determine how many 2x2 icons can fit into the available space. However, this calculation does not account for the fact that each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the remaining space after placing these icons needs to be considered.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Space:**
   - The code subtracts `bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` from `x`, which seems to be an attempt to account for the remaining space after placing some 2x2 icons. This subtraction is incorrect because it does not properly reflect the remaining space available for 1x1 icons.

3. **Incorrect Calculation for Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - The line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It should instead calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons and then determine how many 1x1 icons can fit into that space.

4. **Incorrect Final Calculation:**
   - The final calculation `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)` does not correctly account for the total number of screens needed. It should consider both the screens used for 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
1. Calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
2. Calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. Determine how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space.
4. Calculate the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
5. Sum the screens needed for both types of icons to get the total number of screens.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    # Calculate screens needed for 2x2 icons
    screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
    # Calculate remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
    remaining_space = 5 * 3 * screens_for_2x2 - y * 4
    # Calculate screens needed for 1x1 icons
    screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil((x + remaining_space) / 15)
    # Total screens needed
    total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1
    print(total_screens)

def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()

func_3()
```

This corrected approach ensures that the calculations are accurate and the minimum number of screens needed is correctly determined.
