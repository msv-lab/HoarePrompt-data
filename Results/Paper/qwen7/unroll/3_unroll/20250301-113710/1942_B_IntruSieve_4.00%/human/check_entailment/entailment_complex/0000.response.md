Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \), where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
2. The annotated program only defines the function `func_1()` which processes the array `arr` and prints a list `mex`. However, it does not actually construct the permutation \( p \) as required by the problem statement.
3. The function `func_1()` calculates the `mex` values but does not use these values to construct the permutation \( p \). Instead, it prints the `mex` values directly, which do not represent the permutation \( p \).

Given that the function does not correctly implement the logic to construct the permutation \( p \) based on the given conditions, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
