### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to reconstruct a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \), where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The function should return a valid permutation \( p \).

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes `mex` to store the MEX values and `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the minimum and maximum values encountered.
   - It iterates through the array \( a \):
     - If \( a_i > 0 \), it appends the current minimum value (`minn`) to `mex` and increments `minn`.
     - If \( a_i \leq 0 \), it appends the absolute difference between the negative of \( a_i \) and `minn` to `mex`.
     - It updates `maxx` if necessary.
   - Finally, it prints the elements of `mex`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating MEX values seems to be flawed. The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
   - The current implementation does not correctly calculate the MEX values for each prefix of the permutation \( p \).
   - The code assumes that the MEX can be directly derived from the negative of \( a_i \), which is not always true.
   - The code does not actually construct the permutation \( p \) but instead constructs a list `mex` which is not what the problem requires.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the example provided in the problem statement:
     - Input: `5 1 1 -2 1 2`
     - Expected output: `0 1 4 2 3`
     - The code's output is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the MEX values.
   - Let's manually verify the expected output:
     - For \( i = 1 \): \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}([0]) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1 \)
     - For \( i = 2 \): \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1]) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
     - For \( i = 3 \): \( a_3 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4]) - 4 = 2 - 4 = -2 \)
     - For \( i = 4 \): \( a_4 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2]) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1 \)
     - For \( i = 5 \): \( a_5 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) - 3 = 0 - 3 = 2 \)
   - The code does not produce this output, indicating a logical error.

5. **Function Summary**:
   - The function processes an array `arr` and calculates a list `mex` based on specific conditions. It then prints each element of `mex` separated by a space. After processing, `minn` is updated to be greater than or equal to the maximum value in `arr`, while `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `maxx` remain unchanged. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints the `mex` list.
   - This summary does not match the problem requirements, as it does not construct the permutation \( p \).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The code constructs a list `mex` instead of the permutation \( p \).

**Final: False**
