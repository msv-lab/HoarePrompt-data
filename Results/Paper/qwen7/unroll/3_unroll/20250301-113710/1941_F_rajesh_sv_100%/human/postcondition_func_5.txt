The function indirectly calls `func_2(t, n, m, k, a, d, f)` and returns its result. Here, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `m` and `k` are integers between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order with each integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^9, `d` is a list of `m` integers each between 1 and 10^9, and `f` is a list of `k` integers each between 1 and 10^9. The function does not modify any of these inputs; instead, it passes them to `func_2()` and returns whatever `func_2()` returns.
