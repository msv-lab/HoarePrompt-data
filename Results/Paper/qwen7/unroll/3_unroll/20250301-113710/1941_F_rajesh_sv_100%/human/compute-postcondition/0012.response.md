Output State: `A` is the return value of `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique elements returned by `func_4()`, `F` is the return value of `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference found between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the first element involved in the maximum difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is the minimum value obtained by evaluating `min(max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))` for each `f` in `F` and updating it during the loop iterations.
