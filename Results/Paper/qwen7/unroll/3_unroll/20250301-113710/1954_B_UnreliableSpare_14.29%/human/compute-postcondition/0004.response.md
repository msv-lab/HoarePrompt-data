Output State: `flag` is False, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.

Explanation: The loop checks if the current element in the list `arr` is different from the previous one. If it finds any difference, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. Therefore, `flag` will be `False` if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in `arr` that are different. If no such pair exists, `flag` remains `True`.
