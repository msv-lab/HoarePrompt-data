Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, arr is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

The code reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, and then converts each string in the list to an integer. This list is assigned to the variable `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
