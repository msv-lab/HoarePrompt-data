Based on the initial state provided:

- `flag` is `True`.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
- `val` is the first element of `arr`.
- `cnt` is the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`.
- `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between the current `ans` and `cnt`.

The `print(-1)` statement simply prints the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
