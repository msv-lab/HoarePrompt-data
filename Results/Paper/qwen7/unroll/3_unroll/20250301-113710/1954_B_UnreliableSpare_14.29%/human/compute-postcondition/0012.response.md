Postcondition: **`flag` is True, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between the current `ans` and `cnt`.**
