Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The array a is considered beautiful. For each test case, the function returns information based on the given inputs.**

This means the function `func_1` processes a series of test cases, each containing a test count `t`, a number of elements `n`, and an array `a` of integers. It then returns some form of output based on these inputs, though the specific nature of the return value is not detailed in the provided information.
