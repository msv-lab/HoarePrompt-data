Output State: **`A` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `set_.sort()` sorts the list `set_` in place in ascending order. The initial state of `A` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the sorting operation. The list `set_` is modified to be sorted, but its uniqueness is preserved.
