Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining the winner of a game where players take turns removing a specified number of stones from each non-empty pile, with the player who cannot make a move losing.
2. The solution provided uses a function `func_1` to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of stone piles.
3. The function first removes duplicates and sorts the list of stone counts.
4. If the smallest number of stones in any pile is not 1, the function immediately returns 'Alice', indicating she wins because she can reduce the smallest pile to 0 in one move.
5. The function then iterates through the sorted unique elements to check if the difference between any two consecutive elements is greater than 1. If such a difference is found, it sets a flag `not_c` to `False` and breaks the loop.
6. After the loop, the function toggles a boolean value `A` based on the length of the unique elements list. If the length is even, `A` is `True`; if odd, `A` is `False`.
7. The function returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` (indicating an even length), and 'Bob' otherwise.

The logic in the function aligns with the game rules and correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of unique pile sizes. The function handles all edge cases and follows the optimal strategy for both players.

Correctness: **True**
