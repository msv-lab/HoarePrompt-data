Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic used to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is accurate according to the problem statement.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem asks for the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. Fireworks launched by the first installation every \(a\) minutes and by the second installation every \(b\) minutes are visible for \(m+1\) minutes after launch. The key insight here is to find the number of fireworks launched within the visibility period of any given firework.

2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - \(A = \left\lceil \frac{m}{a} \right\rceil + 1\) calculates the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period of any given firework.
   - \(B = \left\lceil \frac{m}{b} \right\rceil + 1\) calculates the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period of any given firework.
   - The sum \(A + B\) gives the total number of fireworks visible at any given time.

3. **Verification**:
   - The formula \(A = \left\lceil \frac{m}{a} \right\rceil + 1\) correctly accounts for the fact that the last firework launched by the first installation before the end of the visibility period is also counted.
   - Similarly, \(B = \left\lceil \frac{m}{b} \right\rceil + 1\) correctly accounts for the last firework launched by the second installation before the end of the visibility period.
   - The sum \(A + B\) represents the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously because it considers the overlap of visibility periods.

Given the logical correctness of the formulas and their alignment with the problem statement, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
