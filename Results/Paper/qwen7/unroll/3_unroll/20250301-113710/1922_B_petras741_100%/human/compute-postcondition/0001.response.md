Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `buffer` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `buffer`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. Therefore, `t` is still an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and `buffer` is an empty list.
