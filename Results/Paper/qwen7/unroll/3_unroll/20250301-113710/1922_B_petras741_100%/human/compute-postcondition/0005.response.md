Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) with the condition that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5. For each test case, it returns information based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own value of `t` and a list of integers `a`. It processes these inputs and returns specific information related to them, though the exact nature of the return value isn't detailed here.
