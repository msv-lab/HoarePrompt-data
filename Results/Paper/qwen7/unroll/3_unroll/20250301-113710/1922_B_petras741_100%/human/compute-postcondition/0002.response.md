State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `buffer` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
4. Since `buffer` is not used in the loop initialization, its state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` (it must be greater than 0) and `i` (it must be 0).
