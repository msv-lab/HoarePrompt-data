Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. Specifically, the program does not check if the chosen sticks can form a triangle (i.e., if the sum of the lengths of any two sticks is greater than the length of the third stick). Instead, it simply counts the number of ways to choose 3 sticks regardless of whether they can form a triangle.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
2 2 2 2
```

The correct output should be `4` because there are 4 ways to choose 3 sticks of length 2 to form a degenerate triangle. However, the program will output `0` because it does not check the triangle inequality condition.

To fix this, the program needs to include a check to ensure that the chosen sticks satisfy the triangle inequality condition. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        count = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        # Count occurrences of each stick length
        for length in a:
            count[length] += 1
        
        total_ways = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if count[i] == 0:
                continue
            for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
                if count[j] == 0:
                    continue
                k = i + j
                if k <= n and count[k] > 0:
                    if i == j == k:
                        total_ways += count[i] * (count[i] - 1) * (count[i] - 2) // 6
                    elif i == j:
                        total_ways += count[i] * (count[i] - 1) // 2 * count[k]
                    elif j == k:
                        total_ways += count[j] * (count[j] - 1) // 2 * count[i]
                    else:
                        total_ways += count[i] * count[j] * count[k]
        
        print(total_ways)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that only valid combinations of sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle are counted.
