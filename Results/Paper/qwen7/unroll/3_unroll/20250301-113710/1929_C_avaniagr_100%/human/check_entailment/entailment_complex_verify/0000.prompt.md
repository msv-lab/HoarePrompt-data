You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

    #State: Output State: The output state consists of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified in the loop body. For each input line `s`, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are read, and depending on these values, either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed. The exact sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' will vary based on the specific values of `k`, `x`, and `a` provided in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes each line containing integers k, x, and a, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions. After processing all lines, the function concludes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where `x` (maximum number of consecutive losses) is greater than or equal to `k-1` (number of times the bet is increased in case of a win). 

For example, consider the test case `(k, x, a) = (4, 4, 5)`. According to the problem description, Sasha can lose up to 4 times in a row. However, the program incorrectly prints 'NO' for this case because it does not properly account for the possibility of increasing the bet after a series of losses. 

To illustrate, let's walk through the logic for `k=4`, `x=4`, and `a=5`:
- Sasha starts with 5 coins.
- If Sasha loses 4 times in a row, he will have 0 coins.
- Even if he wins after those 4 losses, he would need to place a bet of 5 coins, which is impossible since he has 0 coins.

The program does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to an incorrect output. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.
