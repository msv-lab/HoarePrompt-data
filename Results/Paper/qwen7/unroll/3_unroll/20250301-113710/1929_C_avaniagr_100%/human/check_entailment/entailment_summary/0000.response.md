Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the function matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Key Points to Analyze:
1. **Initial Conditions and Strategy**:
   - The program checks if `x < k - 1`, `x == k - 1`, or `x > k - 1` to determine the strategy.
   - For `x < k - 1`, the program checks if `a >= x + 1` and prints 'YES' or 'NO'.
   - For `x == k - 1`, the program checks if `a >= x + 2` and prints 'YES' or 'NO'.
   - For `x > k - 1`, the program calculates `z` using a loop and checks if `a >= z`.

2. **Strategy Analysis**:
   - The strategy for `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1` seems to be straightforward and aligns with the problem statement.
   - For `x > k - 1`, the strategy involves calculating `z` using a loop. This calculation appears to be an attempt to determine the minimum number of coins needed to ensure Sasha can win regardless of the number of coins he needs.

3. **Promotion Rule**:
   - The promotion rule states that Sasha cannot lose more than `x` times in a row. The program correctly checks this condition and adjusts the strategy accordingly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where `a` is less than the calculated values for `z` or the required number of coins.

### Verification Against Examples:
- **Example 1**: `k=2`, `x=1`, `a=7`
  - `x < k - 1` is true, and `a >= x + 1` (7 >= 2) is true, so the program prints 'YES'.
- **Example 2**: `k=2`, `x=1`, `a=1`
  - `x < k - 1` is true, but `a < x + 1` (1 < 2) is false, so the program prints 'NO'.
- **Example 3**: `k=2`, `x=3`, `a=15`
  - `x > k - 1` is true, and the program calculates `z` and checks if `a >= z`. The calculations seem to be correct based on the problem constraints.
- **Example 4**: `k=3`, `x=3`, `a=6`
  - `x == k - 1` is true, and `a < x + 2` (6 < 5) is false, so the program prints 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins based on the given constraints. The strategy and calculations match the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
