Output State: The output state consists of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified in the loop body. For each input line `s`, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are read, and depending on these values, either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed. The exact sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' will vary based on the specific values of `k`, `x`, and `a` provided in each iteration.
