Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads input from standard input using `[*open(0)][1:]`. This is correct for reading multiple test cases from stdin.

2. **Variable Extraction**:
   - The program extracts `k`, `x`, and `a` from each line using `map(int, s.split())`. This is correct as per the problem statement.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks different conditions based on the values of `x` and `k`:
     - **Case 1**: `x < k - 1`
       - If `a >= x + 1`, it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - **Case 2**: `x == k - 1`
       - If `a >= x + 2`, it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - **Case 3**: `x > k - 1`
       - It calculates `z = k - 2` and iterates over a range to update `z`.
       - If `a >= z`, it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Detailed Analysis of Conditions

1. **Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \)**:
   - If Sasha can lose up to \( x \) times in a row, and \( x < k - 1 \), he can still recover because after losing \( x \) times, he can start betting again.
   - The condition \( a \geq x + 1 \) ensures that even after losing \( x \) times, he can still place a bet of 1 coin and recover.

2. **Case 2: \( x == k - 1 \)**:
   - If Sasha can lose exactly \( k - 1 \) times in a row, he needs to ensure that after these losses, he can still place a bet of 2 coins.
   - The condition \( a \geq x + 2 \) ensures that after losing \( k - 1 \) times, he can place a bet of 2 coins and recover.

3. **Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \)**:
   - If Sasha can lose more than \( k - 1 \) times in a row, the program calculates \( z \) to determine the minimum number of coins required to recover.
   - The formula \( z = k - 2 \) and the loop updates \( z \) to account for the recovery strategy.
   - The condition \( a \geq z \) ensures that Sasha has enough coins to recover.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: \( k = 2 \), \( x = 1 \), \( a = 7 \)
  - \( x < k - 1 \) (1 < 1), \( a \geq x + 1 \) (7 >= 2), so print 'YES'.

- **Example 2**: \( k = 2 \), \( x = 1 \), \( a = 1 \)
  - \( x < k - 1 \) (1 < 1), \( a < x + 1 \) (1 < 2), so print 'NO'.

- **Example 3**: \( k = 2 \), \( x = 3 \), \( a = 15 \)
  - \( x > k - 1 \) (3 > 1), calculate \( z \) and check \( a \geq z \).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
