### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Reading Test Case Input**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - It checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIRS' if this condition is true.
   - It checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is true.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'NONE'.

However, there is a small issue with the condition checking in the program. The condition for checking a peak should be `a < b > c`, but the comparison operator `>` should be placed correctly. The current implementation uses `a < b > c`, which is interpreted as `a < (b > c)`, which is not the intended logic. The correct condition should be `a < b and b > c`.

Let's verify this with the example inputs:

- For the input `1 2 3`, the condition `1 < 2 and 2 > 3` is `False`, so it correctly prints 'STAIRS'.
- For the input `3 2 1`, the condition `3 < 2 and 2 > 1` is `False`, so it correctly prints 'PEAK'.
- For the input `1 5 3`, the condition `1 < 5 and 5 > 3` is `True`, so it correctly prints 'PEAK'.
- For the input `3 4 1`, the condition `3 < 4 and 4 > 1` is `True`, so it correctly prints 'PEAK'.
- For the input `0 0 0`, the condition `0 < 0 and 0 > 0` is `False`, so it correctly prints 'NONE'.
- For the input `4 1 7`, the condition `4 < 1 and 1 > 7` is `False`, so it correctly prints 'NONE'.
- For the input `4 5 7`, the condition `4 < 5 and 5 > 7` is `False`, so it correctly prints 'STAIRS'.

Although the program produces the correct output for the given examples, the condition for checking a peak is incorrectly written. To fix this, we need to change the condition from `a < b > c` to `a < b and b > c`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

Given the corrected condition, the program now correctly implements the logic for determining whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate in its reasoning, but the condition for checking a peak was incorrectly written. After correcting the condition, the program is now correct.
