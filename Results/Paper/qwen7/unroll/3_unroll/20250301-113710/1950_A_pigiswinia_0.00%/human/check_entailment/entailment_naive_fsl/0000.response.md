Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a typo in the output string for the "STAIR" case. It prints 'STAIRS' instead of 'STAIR'. This minor error means the program does not meet the exact requirements specified in the problem description. For example, if the input is `1 2 3`, the program will output `STAIRS` instead of `STAIR`.
