Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `result` and `results`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `idx` is given as `2 + 2 * t`.
   - `t` is unchanged.
   - `data` is unchanged.
   - `n` is an integer obtained from `int(data[0])`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data` starting from `idx + t` to `idx + 2 * t`.
   - `results` is a list of outputs from `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `results`. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `results`, the only relevant state to adjust is `results`. It must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `results` must contain at least one element.

**State:**
**`results` must contain at least one element**
