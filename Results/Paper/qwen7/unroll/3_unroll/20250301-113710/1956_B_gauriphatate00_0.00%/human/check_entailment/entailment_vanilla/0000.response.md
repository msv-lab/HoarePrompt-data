### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the maximum number of points you can get in the game.
   - Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score.
   - You want to maximize your score under this condition.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the minimum of two values:
     1. The number of pairs of cards in your hand (where a pair means two cards with the same number).
     2. Half of the total number of cards you have (`n // 2`).
   - The logic here is that Nene will always try to block your points by placing cards on the table when possible. If you have more than half of the cards in pairs, Nene can block all but one of those pairs, giving you at most one point per pair.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly parses the input and outputs the results.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound because:
     - If you have more than `n // 2` pairs, Nene can block all but one of those pairs, giving you at most one point per pair.
     - If you have fewer or equal to `n // 2` pairs, Nene can block all pairs, giving you zero points.
   - The implementation in `func_2` is also correct as it correctly handles reading multiple test cases and calling `func_1` for each.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
