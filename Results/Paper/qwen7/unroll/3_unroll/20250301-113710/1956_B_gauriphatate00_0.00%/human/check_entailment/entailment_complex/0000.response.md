Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(n, a)` aims to calculate the minimum value between the number of pairs (integers appearing exactly twice) in the list `a` and half the number of cards (`n`).
   - This function correctly counts the pairs using `Counter(a)` and then uses a generator expression to count how many integers appear exactly twice.
   - It returns the minimum of these two values, which aligns with the strategy that Nene will play optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2()` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1(n, a)` for each test case.
   - It correctly parses the input data, extracts the necessary values for each test case, and stores the results of `func_1(n, a)` in a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.
   - The logic for reading and processing input is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - Both functions work together to solve the problem as described.
   - Function 1 correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get.
   - Function 2 correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
