### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp must send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend will come to the party if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The function `func()` takes input but does not handle multiple test cases. It processes only one set of inputs at a time.
   - The variable `n` is defined as the number of friends, but it is not used within the loop where the logic should be implemented.
   - The program reads `x` which is redundant as `n` is already defined.
   - The logic inside the loop checks if `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, which means checking if a friend is their own best friend. This is incorrect because the problem states that `p_i` are distinct and `p_i != i`.
   - If the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is true, the program prints `2` and breaks the loop, assuming that two friends who are each other's best friends will attend. However, this logic is flawed because it does not account for the possibility that more than two friends might attend if there are cycles or multiple pairs.
   - If the condition is false, the program prints `3`. This is also incorrect because it assumes that three friends need to be invited, which is not always the case.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to identify cycles in the best friend relationships. If there is a cycle of length 2, we only need to invite 2 friends from that cycle.
   - If there are cycles of length greater than 2, we need to invite friends from those cycles to ensure at least 2 friends attend.
   - If there are no cycles, we need to invite at least 3 friends to ensure at least 2 attend.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
