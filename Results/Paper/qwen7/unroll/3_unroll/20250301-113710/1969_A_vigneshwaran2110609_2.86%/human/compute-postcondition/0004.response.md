Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` and does not equal its index. For each test case, the function determines and returns the result based on the given conditions.**
