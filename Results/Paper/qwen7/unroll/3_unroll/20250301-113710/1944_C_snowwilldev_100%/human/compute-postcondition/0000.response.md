Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, N is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `N = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `N`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state as a positive integer within the specified range. The variable `n` is not defined in the initial state and is only mentioned in the context of the precondition for the list `a`, which is not relevant here. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `N` as an input integer and retains the initial state of `t`.
