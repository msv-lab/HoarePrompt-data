Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is the sum of the counts of each integer in `a` divided by 4.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.
- `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the value of `ans`.

The value of `ans` is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{ans} = \frac{\sum_{k \in \text{keys(cnt)}} \text{cnt}[k]}{4} \]

Here, the numerator is the sum of the counts of each integer in the list `a`. This means we take the count of each unique integer in `a` and add them up.

Since the exact values of `a` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know it is the sum of the counts of each integer in `a` divided by 4.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the counts of each integer in list `a` divided by 4)**
