### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Value of `t`**:
   - The initial value of `t` is set to 1, but it is immediately overwritten by the actual input value. This means that the program correctly reads the number of test cases from the input, not the hardcoded value of 1.
   
2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function `func_1()` is indeed designed to process one test case. It correctly reads the number of sticks `n` and their lengths into a list `a`.
   - A dictionary `cnt` is used to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - For each unique stick length, the program calculates how many complete polygons can be formed by dividing the count of that length by 4. This logic is correct because each polygon requires 4 sides of equal length.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program uses a loop to iterate over the number of test cases (`t`). For each test case, it calls `func_1()`, which processes the sticks for that specific test case.
   - The annotated code confirms that the program correctly handles the input for each test case and prints the result accordingly.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the correct number of polygons that can be formed for each test case, as verified by the example provided in the problem description.

Given these points, the program correctly handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement. The initial assessment was incorrect in stating that the program only processes one test case due to the initial value of `t`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided example.
