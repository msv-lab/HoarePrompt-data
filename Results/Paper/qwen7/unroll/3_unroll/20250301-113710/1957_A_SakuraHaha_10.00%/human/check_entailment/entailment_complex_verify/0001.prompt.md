You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is the sum of the counts of each integer in `a` divided by 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the counts of each integer in list `a` divided by 4)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t` indicating the number of subsequent test cases, followed by `t` sets of data. Each set consists of an integer `n` and `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each set, it counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`, then calculates the sum of these counts divided by 4, and finally prints this sum for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program starts by reading an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. However, the initial value of `t` is set to 1 and immediately overwritten by the input. This means the program will only handle one test case, even though it is designed to handle multiple test cases as per the problem statement.
2. The function `func_1()` is defined to process one test case. It correctly reads the number of sticks `n` and their lengths into a list `a`.
3. A dictionary `cnt` is used to count the occurrences of each stick length.
4. For each unique stick length, the program calculates how many complete polygons can be formed by dividing the count of that length by 4 (since all sides of a polygon must be equal).
5. The results are printed for each test case.

Given these points, the program does not correctly handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem. It only processes one test case and ignores the value of `t` after overwriting it.
