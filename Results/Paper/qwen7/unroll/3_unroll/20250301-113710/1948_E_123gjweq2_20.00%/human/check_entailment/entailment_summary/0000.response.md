Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to assign distinct integers to vertices of a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes an array `arr` and another array `cliquess` both of size `n`.
   - It calls the `make_array` function to populate these arrays.

3. **Analysis of `make_array`**:
   - The `make_array` function takes a range `[left, right]` and assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` in a specific pattern.
   - It divides the range into two parts and assigns values symmetrically around the midpoint.
   - This ensures that vertices within the same segment of the range will have the same value in `cliquess`, thus forming a clique.

4. **Verification**:
   - The approach taken in `func_1` and `make_array` seems to correctly partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
   - The assignment of values in `arr` and `cliquess` ensures that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied for vertices in the same clique.
   - The output format matches the required format for the problem.

Given the above analysis, the implementation appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
