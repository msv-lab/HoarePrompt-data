The function `make_array` takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It fills a portion of the `arr` and `cliquess` lists with specific values based on the given range defined by `left` and `right`. Specifically, it assigns values starting from `left + 1` up to `right + 1` to `arr` in a symmetric manner around the midpoint of the range, and sets the corresponding elements in `cliquess` to the value of `clique`. The final state of the program includes the updated `arr` and `cliquess` lists within the specified range.
