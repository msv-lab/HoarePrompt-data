#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each x in test_cases.

    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing the best `y` value for each `x` in `test_cases`, where the best `y` is determined as the value that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` plus `y`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named 'results' where each element corresponds to the best 'y' value for each 'x' in 'test_cases'. The best 'y' value is the one that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor of 'x' and 'y' plus 'y'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers between 2 and 1000. For each `x` in `test_cases`, it finds the best `y` value that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` plus `y`. It then returns a list named 'results' containing these best `y` values for each `x` in `test_cases`.
