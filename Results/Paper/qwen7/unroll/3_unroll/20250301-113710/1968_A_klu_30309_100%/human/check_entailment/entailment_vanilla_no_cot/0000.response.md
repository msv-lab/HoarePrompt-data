Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description. Here's a brief explanation of why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers from the input.
2. It defines a function `func_1` that iterates through each test case `x`, finding the integer `y` (where \(1 \le y < x\)) such that the sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` plus `y` is maximized.
3. The logic inside the function `func_1` is sound:
   - It initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - It iterates over all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 1.
   - For each `y`, it calculates the gcd of `x` and `y` and adds `y` to this value.
   - If the resulting sum is greater than the current `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to `y`.
   - The loop breaks early once a better `y` is found, which optimizes the search.
   - The function appends the best `y` found for each `x` to the results list.
4. Finally, it prints out the results for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work as expected to solve the problem.
