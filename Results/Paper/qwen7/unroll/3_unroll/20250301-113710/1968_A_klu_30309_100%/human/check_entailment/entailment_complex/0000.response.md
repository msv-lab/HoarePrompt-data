Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and the subsequent test cases into a list `test_cases`. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Function Definition**: The `func_1` function is defined to process each test case. It initializes `max_sum` and `best_y` variables to keep track of the maximum sum and the corresponding `y` value, respectively.

3. **Loop Through Possible `y` Values**: For each `x` in `test_cases`, the function iterates over all possible `y` values from `x-1` down to `1`. This ensures that we check all potential candidates for `y`.

4. **GCD Calculation and Sum Calculation**: For each `y`, the function calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd_val`) of `x` and `y` using `math.gcd()`. It then computes the sum `current_sum` as `gcd_val + y`.

5. **Update Best `y`**: If the `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, the function updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to the current `y`. The loop breaks early because we only need the first `y` that gives the maximum sum.

6. **Collect Results**: After processing all `y` values for a given `x`, the function appends `best_y` to the `results` list.

7. **Return Results**: Finally, the function returns the `results` list, which contains the best `y` values for each `x` in `test_cases`.

8. **Output**: The main program prints each element of the `results` list, which corresponds to the best `y` value for each `x` in `test_cases`.

Given that the logic implemented in the function matches the problem requirements and the annotated states correctly describe the flow of the program, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
