State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `w` must be greater than 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `w`, which controls the number of iterations of the loop.
- For the loop to execute, `w` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
- The value of `t` (which is constrained between 1 and 100) does not affect the loop's execution condition directly. Therefore, it does not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `w` is greater than 0.
