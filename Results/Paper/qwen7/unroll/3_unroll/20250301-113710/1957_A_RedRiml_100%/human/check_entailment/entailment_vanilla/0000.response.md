Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `w` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` representing the number of sticks.
   - It then reads a list of stick lengths into the variable `palka`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - A dictionary `d` is initialized to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - A list `pl` is initialized to store unique stick lengths.
   - The program iterates over the stick lengths in `palka`, updating the count in `d` and adding unique lengths to `pl`.

3. **Calculating Maximum Polygons:**
   - The variable `shapes` is initialized to zero.
   - The program iterates over the unique stick lengths in `pl`.
   - For each unique length `j`, it checks if there are at least 3 sticks of that length (`d[j] >= 3`).
   - If so, it adds the integer division of the count by 3 to `shapes`.

4. **Output:**
   - The final value of `shapes` is printed for each test case.

### Verification Against Problem Description

- **Test Case Handling:** The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over `w` test cases.
- **Stick Counting:** The program correctly counts the occurrences of each stick length using a dictionary.
- **Unique Stick Lengths:** The program correctly identifies unique stick lengths and ensures no stick is counted more than once.
- **Polygon Formation:** The program correctly calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed by checking if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length and dividing by 3.

### Edge Cases

- **No Sticks:** If there are no sticks, the program will output 0, which is correct.
- **Single Stick:** If there is only one stick, the program will output 0, which is correct.
- **Multiple Test Cases:** The program handles multiple test cases correctly, processing each independently.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
