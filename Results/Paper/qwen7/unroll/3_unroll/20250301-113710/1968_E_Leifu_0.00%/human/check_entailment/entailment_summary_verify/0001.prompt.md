You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print('1 1')
        print('1 2')
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \) (1 to 50) and an integer \( n \) (2 to 10^3). For each test case, it prints specific pairs of integers starting with '1 1' and '1 2'. If \( n \) equals 3, it prints '2 3'; otherwise, it prints '2 4' followed by pairs of integers from 4 to \( n \), each pair being the integer with itself (e.g., '4 4', '5 5'). The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to place `n` cells in an `n x n` grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It always prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which will always be part of the solution.
   - If `n` is 3, it additionally prints `(2, 3)`. This is a valid configuration for `n=3` as it maximizes the set of distinct Manhattan distances.
   - For `n > 3`, it prints `(1, 4)` and `(2, 4)`, and then for each subsequent row from 4 to `n`, it prints `(j, j)`.
   
3. **Verification**:
   - For `n=2`: The solution prints `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, resulting in Manhattan distances `{0, 1}`. This is correct.
   - For `n=3`: The solution prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`, resulting in Manhattan distances `{0, 1, 2, 3}`. This is correct.
   - For `n=4`: The solution prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(1, 4)`, `(2, 4)`, and then `(4, 4)`, `(3, 3)`, `(5, 5)`, etc., which results in a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances. This is correct.
   - For `n=5`: The solution prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(1, 4)`, `(2, 4)`, and then `(4, 4)`, `(5, 5)`, etc., which is a valid configuration.
   - For `n=6`: The solution prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(1, 4)`, `(2, 4)`, and then `(4, 4)`, `(5, 5)`, `(6, 6)`, etc., which is also a valid configuration.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for all tested values of `n`.
