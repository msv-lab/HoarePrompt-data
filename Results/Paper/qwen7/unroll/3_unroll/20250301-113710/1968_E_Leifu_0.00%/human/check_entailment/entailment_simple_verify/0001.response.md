### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).
   - It always prints the coordinates \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), which will always be part of the solution.
   - If \( n \) is 3, it additionally prints \((2, 3)\). This is a valid configuration for \( n=3 \) as it maximizes the set of distinct Manhattan distances.
   - For \( n > 3 \), it prints \((1, 4)\) and \((2, 4)\), and then for each subsequent row from 4 to \( n \), it prints \((j, j)\).

3. **Verification**:
   - For \( n=2 \): The solution prints \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), resulting in Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1\}\). This is correct.
   - For \( n=3 \): The solution prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\), resulting in Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\). This is correct.
   - For \( n=4 \): The solution prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 4)\), \((2, 4)\), and then \((4, 4)\), \((3, 3)\), \((5, 5)\), etc., which results in a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances. However, the provided solution does not cover all possible configurations that could maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances. Specifically, the configuration \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\) would yield a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\).
   - For \( n=5 \): The solution prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 4)\), \((2, 4)\), and then \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), etc., which is a valid but not necessarily optimal configuration.
   - For \( n=6 \): The solution prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 4)\), \((2, 4)\), and then \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), \((6, 6)\), etc., which is a valid but not necessarily optimal configuration.

Given the analysis, the provided solution does not always maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for all tested values of \( n \). Specifically, for \( n \geq 4 \), the solution does not consider all possible configurations that could yield a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided solution is not always correct because it does not guarantee the maximum size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \( n \).
