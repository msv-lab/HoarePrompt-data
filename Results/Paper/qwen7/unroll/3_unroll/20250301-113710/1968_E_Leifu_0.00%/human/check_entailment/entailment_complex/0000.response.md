Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by generating specific cell coordinates for each test case. However, the logic in the program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all test cases.

1. **For \( n = 2 \)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     ```
   - The Manhattan distances are:
     \[
     |1-1| + |1-1| = 0, \quad |1-1| + |2-2| = 0, \quad |1-1| + |1-2| = 1
     \]
   - Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which is correct.

2. **For \( n = 3 \)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 3
     ```
   - The Manhattan distances are:
     \[
     |1-1| + |1-1| = 0, \quad |1-1| + |2-2| = 0, \quad |1-1| + |1-3| = 2, \quad |1-2| + |1-3| = 2, \quad |2-1| + |3-1| = 3
     \]
   - Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 2, 3\}\), which is correct.

3. **For \( n = 4 \)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     4 4
     5 5
     ```
   - The Manhattan distances include:
     \[
     |1-1| + |1-1| = 0, \quad |1-1| + |2-2| = 0, \quad |1-1| + |1-4| = 3, \quad |1-2| + |1-4| = 4, \quad |2-1| + |4-1| = 5, \quad |4-4| + |4-4| = 0, \quad \text{(and others)}
     \]
   - This does not cover all possible distances. A better configuration would be:
     ```
     1 1
     1 3
     4 3
     4 4
     ```
   - The Manhattan distances would then be:
     \[
     |1-1| + |1-1| = 0, \quad |1-1| + |3-3| = 0, \quad |1-1| + |1-4| = 3, \quad |1-3| + |1-4| = 3, \quad |4-1| + |3-4| = 3, \quad |4-4| + |4-4| = 0, \quad \text{(and others)}
     \]
   - This configuration includes more unique distances.

4. **For \( n = 5 \)** and higher:
   - Similar issues arise. The program's approach does not always generate the maximum number of unique distances.

Given these observations, the program does not consistently produce the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
