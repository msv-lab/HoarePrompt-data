Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all potential cases. Specifically, for \(n = 3\), the program outputs the coordinates \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), but it fails to include a third point that would maximize the Manhattan distances. A correct solution for \(n = 3\) should include points like \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\) to achieve the maximum set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For other values of \(n\), the program's approach is also suboptimal. For instance, for \(n = 4\), the program outputs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((4, 4)\). However, a better configuration could include points like \((1, 1)\), \((1, 3)\), \((4, 3)\), and \((4, 4)\), which would yield a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) in all cases.
