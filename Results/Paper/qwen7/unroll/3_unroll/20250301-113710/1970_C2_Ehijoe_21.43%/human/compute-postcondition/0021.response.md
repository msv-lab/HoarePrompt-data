The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), `t` (an integer such that t = 1), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, where each tuple (u, v) indicates an undirected edge between nodes u and v), `start` (an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n), and `moves` (a list of integers representing the sequence of moves made by the players during the game). The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, t, edges, start, and moves, and does not return any specific value.**
