Output State: **`leaves` is an empty deque, `empty` is False, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and for each pair (u, v) entered through input during the loop, `nodes[u]` contains `v` and `nodes[v]` contains `u`.**

Explanation: The line `leaves = deque()` creates a new deque object named `leaves` and assigns it to the variable `leaves`. This deque is initially empty. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
