Postcondition: `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`, `leaves` is a deque containing all the leaf nodes, `empty` is False, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` remains an empty list, `start` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and all moves in `moves` are even numbers.
