Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, each tuple (u, v) indicates an undirected edge between nodes u and v, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, and `moves` is a list of integers representing the sequence of moves made by the players during the game, `n` is updated to the integer input, `t` is updated to the integer input.**

The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `t` respectively. Since `t` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state, it remains unchanged. The values of `edges`, `start`, and `moves` remain unaffected. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions, and only `n` and `t` are updated with the new values from the input.
