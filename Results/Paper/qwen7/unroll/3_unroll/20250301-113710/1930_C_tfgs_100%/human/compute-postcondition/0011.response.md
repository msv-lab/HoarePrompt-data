Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop will iterate over the range defined by `len(a)`. Therefore, `i` should start from 0 and go up to `len(a) - 1`.
3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`. Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute as long as `i < len(a)`.

Given the initial state:
- `counter` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the list `a` without duplicates.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `cur` is 0.
- `cnt` is `n - len(a)`.
- `ans` is an empty list.

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `i`.

**State:**
- `i` is 0 (since the loop starts iterating from 0).

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0**
