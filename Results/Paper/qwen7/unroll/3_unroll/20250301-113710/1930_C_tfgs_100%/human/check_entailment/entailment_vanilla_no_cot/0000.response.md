Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to achieve the lexicographically largest possible `b`. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Set Operations**: The code uses `set` to store elements of `S`, but it should handle duplicates properly. The logic to ensure no duplicate insertions is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Construction of `b`**: The construction of `b` is not done in a way that maximizes its lexicographical value. Specifically, the logic to fill the remaining positions with the smallest possible values is not correctly implemented.

3. **Incorrect Use of `Counter`**: The `Counter` is used to count occurrences, but it is not necessary for the final construction of `b`.

### Correct Approach:
To achieve the lexicographically largest `b`, we need to carefully manage the insertion and deletion steps to maximize the values in `S`. Hereâ€™s a corrected approach:

1. **Insert Elements into `S`**: Ensure that each insertion adds the maximum possible value without duplicating any existing values in `S`.
2. **Sort `S` in Descending Order**: After all insertions, sort `S` in descending order to form `b`.

Here is a revised version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Step 1: Perform the operations to build S
    S = set()
    for i in range(n):
        val = a[i] + i + 1
        while val in S:
            val += 1
        S.add(val)

    # Step 2: Sort S in descending order to form b
    S = sorted(S, reverse=True)

    # Print the result
    print(' '.join(map(str, S)))
```

This approach ensures that each insertion into `S` is unique and maximized, leading to the lexicographically largest possible `b`.
