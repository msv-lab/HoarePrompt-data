Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the list `a` without duplicates, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `cur` is 0, and `cnt` is `n - len(a)`**.

This means that the variable `cnt` is now assigned the value of `n - len(a)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
