Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the list `a`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and the list `a` is a list of integers where each element a[i] is increased by (i + 1) for every iteration i in the range of n.**

Explanation: The code `counter = Counter(a)` creates a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged from the initial state. Each element in `a` has been incremented by `(i + 1)` for every iteration `i` in the range of `n`, as described in the initial state.
