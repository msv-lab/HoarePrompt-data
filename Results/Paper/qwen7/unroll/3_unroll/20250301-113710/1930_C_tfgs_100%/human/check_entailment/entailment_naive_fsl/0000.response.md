Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the elements are inserted into the set `S` in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order of the final array `b`.

The key issue lies in how the program handles the insertion of elements into the set `S`. The program simply adds `a_i + i + 1` to the set `S` without considering whether this value already exists in `S`. According to the problem statement, inserting an element that is already present in the set `S` does not change the elements of the set. Therefore, the program's approach of always adding `a_i + i + 1` might lead to duplicate values being added to `S`, which could result in a suboptimal `b`.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
3
2
2 1
5
1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
3
6 4 8
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 2 
1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
11 7 6 
```

However, the program's output for the first test case is incorrect:
- For the first test case, the program outputs `[3, 2]`, but the correct output should be `[3, 2]` as well, but the program's logic does not ensure that the maximum possible values are inserted into `S`.

The program fails to handle the insertion logic correctly, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
