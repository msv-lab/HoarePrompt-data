Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is a list containing `cnt` consecutive elements where each element is 1 less than the previous element (starting from the last element of the initial `ans`).
- `counter` is updated to reflect the remaining counts of each element in `a`.
- `t`, `n`, `cnt`, and `cur` are unchanged.

Let's break down the `print(*ans)` statement:

1. The `ans` list starts with the last element of its initial state and decreases by 1 for each subsequent element until it contains `cnt` elements.
2. Since the exact initial state of `ans` is not provided, let's assume an example to illustrate this. Suppose the initial `ans` was `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` and `cnt` is 3. Then `ans` would be `[3, 2, 1]`.

Given this, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

Output: **3 2 1** (assuming the initial `ans` was `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` and `cnt` is 3, the actual output will depend on the initial state of `ans` and the value of `cnt`)
