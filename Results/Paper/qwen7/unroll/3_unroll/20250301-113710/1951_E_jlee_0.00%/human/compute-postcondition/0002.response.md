Output State: The output state will depend on the input integer `t` and the strings provided as input within the specified range. For each input string, the program checks various conditions and prints either 'YES' or 'NO', along with additional information when applicable. Specifically:

- If the string length is 1, it prints 'NO'.
- If the first character is different from the last character, it prints 'YES' with index 1.
- If all characters are the same, it prints 'NO'.
- If exactly one character is different and the string length is odd, it prints 'NO'.
- If exactly one character is different and the string length is even, it prints 'YES' with index 1.
- If there is more than one character different, it checks for two possible splits where the characters match up to a certain point and prints 'YES' with index 2 and the split strings, or 'NO' if no such split exists.

Each iteration of the loop processes one string independently, so the final output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses followed by the appropriate indices and split strings (if applicable), corresponding to each input string.
