You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: The output state will depend on the input integer `t` and the strings provided as input within the specified range. For each input string, the program checks various conditions and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional information if applicable. The final state will consist of all the printed outputs for each iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.

2. **Single Character String Handling:**
   - If the string length is 1, the program prints 'NO', which is correct because a single character is always a palindrome.

3. **Checking First and Last Characters:**
   - If the first and last characters are different, the program prints 'YES' and the entire string as the partition. This is correct because a string with different first and last characters cannot be a palindrome.
   
4. **All Characters Same:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same, the program prints 'NO'. This is correct because such a string is a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

5. **Counting Specific Characters:**
   - The program checks if the count of a specific character (the first one) is equal to the length of the string minus one. If so, it further checks if the middle character (if the string length is odd) is different from the first character. This logic is flawed because it doesn't guarantee a valid partition; it only checks for a specific condition that might not lead to a valid partition.

6. **Iterating Through the String:**
   - The program then iterates through the string to find a valid partition. However, the logic here is complex and does not cover all edge cases properly. Specifically, it tries to find a point where the characters before and after that point are different, which is not sufficient to ensure a valid partition.

7. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, it fails to consider strings like "aabaa" or "ababa", which can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

### Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case: "sinktheyacht"**
   - The program correctly identifies this as a non-palindrome and prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.

2. **Test Case: "lllllllll"**
   - The program correctly identifies this as a palindrome and prints "NO".

3. **Test Case: "uwuowouwu"**
   - The program should identify this as a non-palindrome and print "YES". However, the current implementation might fail to find a valid partition.

### Conclusion:

The program has several logical flaws and does not cover all edge cases. Therefore, it is not fully correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
