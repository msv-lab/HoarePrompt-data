Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the desired number of jewels `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes variables `rep` (number of stalls), `number` (price per jewel for the current stall), and `tab` (list to store prices).

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `n` (remaining coins) is not zero, `k` (remaining jewels to buy) is greater than zero, the number of stalls (`rep`) is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It calculates the minimum (`Min`) and maximum (`Max`) possible prices per jewel for the current stall.
     - If `Max` equals `k` and the product of `n` and `Min` is less than or equal to `k`, it sets `number` to `Min` and reduces `k` by `Max`.
     - Otherwise, it sets `number` to `Max` and reduces `k` by `Min`.
     - It appends the current price `number` to the list `tab`.
     - It updates `n` by subtracting the product of `Min` and `Max`.
     - It increments the stall count `rep`.

4. **Checking Final Conditions:**
   - After the loop, if `k` is zero, it prints "YES", the number of stalls (`len(tab)`), and the list of prices.
   - If `k` is not zero, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case when `n` is zero or `k` is zero.
   - It ensures that the number of stalls does not exceed 60.

2. **Greedy Approach:**
   - The program uses a greedy approach to assign prices to stalls. It tries to maximize the number of jewels bought from each stall while ensuring that `k` jewels are bought in total.
   - The logic for determining `Min` and `Max` prices is correct and ensures that the program does not exceed the constraints.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the problem requirements. If it is possible to buy exactly `k` jewels, it prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls and the list of prices. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It handles all the required conditions and outputs the correct results as per the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
