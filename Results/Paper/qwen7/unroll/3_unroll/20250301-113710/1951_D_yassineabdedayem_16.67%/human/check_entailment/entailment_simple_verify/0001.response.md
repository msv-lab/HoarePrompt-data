### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Key Points to Verify:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It initializes variables `rep`, `number`, and `tab` appropriately.

2. **Main Loop Logic:**
   - The loop runs as long as `n` is not zero, `k` is greater than zero, the number of stalls `rep` is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `Min` and `Max` values correctly.
   - Depending on the conditions, it updates `number`, `k`, and `n` appropriately.
   - It appends the calculated `number` to `tab` and increments the stall count `rep`.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - If `k` is zero after the loop, it prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls and the prices stored in `tab`.
   - If `k` is not zero, it prints "NO".

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The loop condition `n >= k` ensures that Alice does not attempt to buy more jewels than she has coins for.
   - The condition `rep < 60` ensures that the number of stalls does not exceed the limit.

2. **Price Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating `Min` and `Max` ensures that Alice buys the maximum possible number of jewels from each stall without exceeding her budget.
   - The update `n -= Min * Max` correctly reflects the reduction in Alice's coins after buying jewels.

3. **Output Validation:**
   - The output format matches the problem requirements. It prints "YES" or "NO" followed by the number of stalls and the prices if applicable.

#### Verification Against Example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `7 3`
  - Output: `YES`
  - Explanation: Alice buys 3 jewels from the first stall and is left with 1 coin. The program correctly identifies this and prints "YES".

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `6 4`
  - Output: `NO`
  - Explanation: Alice cannot buy exactly 4 jewels with the given constraints. The program correctly identifies this and prints "NO".

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `255 8`
  - Output: `YES`
  - Explanation: Alice buys 1 jewel from each of the 8 stalls and is left with no coins. The program correctly identifies this and prints "YES".

Based on the detailed analysis and verification against the example test cases, the program correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
