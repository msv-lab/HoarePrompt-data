Output State: **The output state depends on the input values of `n` and `k` for each iteration. If `n` becomes zero before `k` reaches zero or `rep` reaches 60, it prints 'YES' followed by the length of `tab` and the elements in `tab`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The value of `t` will be the number of such iterations performed.**
