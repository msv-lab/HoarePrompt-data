Functionality: **The function processes up to 1000 test cases, where each test case consists of integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it repeatedly divides \( n \) by \( k \) (or vice versa) and records the quotient in a list until either \( n \) becomes less than \( k \), \( n \) is exhausted, or 60 iterations are reached. If \( n \) becomes zero before \( k \) or the maximum iterations are reached, it prints 'YES' followed by the length of the recorded quotients and the quotients themselves. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints the results based on the input values.**
