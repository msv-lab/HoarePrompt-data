Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes integers t, n, and k. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and given positive integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, the function does not explicitly return a value but processes these inputs according to their constraints.**

However, since the specific output or processing logic within the function body is not provided, the exact return value cannot be detailed. The function appears to validate the inputs based on specified constraints.
