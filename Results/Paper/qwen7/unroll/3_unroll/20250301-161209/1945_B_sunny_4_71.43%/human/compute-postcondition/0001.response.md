Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder for an index) and `t`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since `t` is the only variable mentioned in the loop head, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state where `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
