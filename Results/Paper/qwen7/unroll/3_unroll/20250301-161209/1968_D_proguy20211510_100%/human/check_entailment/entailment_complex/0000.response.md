Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` as integers. This matches the problem statement.

2. **Permutation and Array Reading**: The program correctly reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` as lists of integers. This also aligns with the problem requirements.

3. **Path Calculation for Bodya and Sasha**: 
   - The program calculates the path and scores for Bodya and Sasha separately using while loops. It ensures that each player's path is followed until a cycle is detected (i.e., a previously visited position is encountered again). This is crucial for determining the maximum possible score for each player.

4. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum possible score for Bodya and Sasha over `k` turns. It uses a for loop to iterate through the path and accumulates the score, considering the remaining turns. This logic is correct and follows the rules of the game.

5. **Output Determination**:
   - The program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw"). This part is also correct and follows the problem statement.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` might be less than the length of the path. It breaks the loop when `k` is less than the current index plus one, ensuring that only valid turns are considered.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
