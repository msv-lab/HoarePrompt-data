Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. Specifically, the program calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha but does not account for the possibility of moving to the position `p_x` during each turn. Instead, it only considers staying at the current position for each turn.

To illustrate this issue, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bodya
```

However, the program will output:
```
Sasha
```

This happens because the program only adds the score for the current position without considering the move to `p_x`. For instance, in the first turn, Bodya starts at position 3 and gets a score of `a_3 = 5`. However, the program does not account for the fact that Bodya could move to position 2 (since `p_3 = 2`) and get an additional score of `a_2 = 2`, making the total score for Bodya `5 + 2 = 7`.

Similarly, Sasha starts at position 2 and gets a score of `a_2 = 2`. The program does not account for the fact that Sasha could move to position 1 (since `p_2 = 1`) and get an additional score of `a_1 = 7`, making the total score for Sasha `2 + 7 = 9`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly simulate the game's rules, leading to incorrect results.
