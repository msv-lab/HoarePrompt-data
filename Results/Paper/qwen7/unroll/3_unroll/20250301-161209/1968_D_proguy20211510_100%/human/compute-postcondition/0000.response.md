Output State: **t is a positive integer, n, k, P_B, P_S are positive integers, p is a permutation of length n, a is an array of positive integers of length n, YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO'**.

Explanation: The code defines two string constants, `YES` and `NO`, with their respective values. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and the new constants `YES` and `NO` are defined as specified.
