Functionality: **The function processes a list `a` of non-negative integers and returns the smallest integer `i` such that either `cnt[i]` is 0 (where `cnt` is a dictionary counting occurrences of each integer in `a`) or `t` (a counter incremented when `cnt[i]` equals 1) reaches 2. If no such `i` is found, the function returns the last index `N` checked.**
