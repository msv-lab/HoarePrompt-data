Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `N` is an input integer, and for each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n. Additionally, the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**

In this output state, the variable `t` retains its initial condition as a positive integer within the specified range. The variable `N` is assigned the value of the integer input, while the conditions for `n` and `a` remain unchanged and are still valid as per the initial state.
