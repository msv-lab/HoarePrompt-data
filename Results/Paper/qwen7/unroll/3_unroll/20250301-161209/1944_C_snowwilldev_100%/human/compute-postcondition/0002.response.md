Output State: **`cnt` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `N` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `cnt` with the default factory set to `int`. This means that `cnt` is a dictionary where any key that does not exist will automatically be initialized with the value `0` when accessed. The other variables (`t`, `N`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
