You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it checks if \( n \) is odd or even and compares \( 2a \) with \( b \). Based on these conditions, it prints either \( a \times n \) or \( \frac{n}{2} \times b + a \) if \( n \) is odd, and either \( a \times n \) or \( \frac{n}{2} \times b \) if \( n \) is even. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where it's more advantageous to buy two yogurts at the promotion price even when `n` is even. Specifically, the program checks if `n` is odd and then compares `2 * a` with `b`, but it fails to consider the scenario where buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them individually.

For example, consider the input:
```
2 5 10
```
Here, `n = 2`, `a = 5`, and `b = 10`. The correct minimum cost should be `10` (since buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them individually). However, the program will incorrectly calculate the cost as `2 * 5 = 10` for even `n` without considering the promotion price.

To fix this, the program should always check if buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper before deciding the cost. Here’s a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            print((n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a)

func()
```

This version ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum cost for both odd and even values of `n`.
