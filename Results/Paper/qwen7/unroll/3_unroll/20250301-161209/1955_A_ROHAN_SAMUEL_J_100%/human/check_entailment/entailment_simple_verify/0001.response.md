### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Promotion vs Regular Price Calculation:**
   - The program handles both even and odd values of `n` correctly.
   - For odd `n`:
     - It checks if `2 * a < b`. If true, it uses the regular price for all yogurts (`a * n`). If false, it uses the promotion price for pairs and the regular price for the last yogurt (`n // 2 * b + a`).
   - For even `n`:
     - It checks if `2 * a < b`. If true, it uses the regular price for all yogurts (`a * n`). If false, it uses the promotion price for all pairs (`n // 2 * b`).

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where `n` is small (e.g., `n = 1`), as it falls into the odd `n` category and uses the regular price.
   - The program also correctly handles cases where `n` is large and the promotion is beneficial.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case as required.

### Verification:

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples and additional test cases:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `2 5 9`
  - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is even, we check `2 * a < b`:
    - `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`, so use the promotion price: `2 * 9 = 18` (but since we're buying 2, it's actually `9`).

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `3 5 9`
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is odd, we check `2 * a < b`:
    - `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`, so use the promotion price for pairs and regular price for the last: `1 * 9 + 1 * 5 = 14`.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `3 5 11`
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is odd, we check `2 * a < b`:
    - `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`, so use the regular price for all: `3 * 5 = 15`.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `4 5 11`
  - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is even, we check `2 * a < b`:
    - `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`, so use the regular price for all: `4 * 5 = 20`.

- **Additional Test Case:**
  - Input: `5 7 13`
  - `n = 5`, `a = 7`, `b = 13`
  - Since `n` is odd, we check `2 * a < b`:
    - `2 * 7 = 14 > 13`, so use the promotion price for pairs and regular price for the last: `2 * 13 + 1 * 7 = 33`.

- **Another Additional Test Case:**
  - Input: `6 6 10`
  - `n = 6`, `a = 6`, `b = 10`
  - Since `n` is even, we check `2 * a < b`:
    - `2 * 6 = 12 > 10`, so use the promotion price for all: `6 * 10 / 2 = 30`.

The program correctly handles all these cases, including edge cases and additional test cases.
