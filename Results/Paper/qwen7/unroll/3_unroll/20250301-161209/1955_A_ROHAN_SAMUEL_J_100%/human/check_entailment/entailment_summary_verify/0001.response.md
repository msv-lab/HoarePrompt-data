### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis and verify the logic step-by-step using the provided problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Maxim needs to buy exactly \( n \) yogurts.
- The price of one yogurt is \( a \) burles.
- There is a promotion where two yogurts can be bought for \( b \) burles.
- We need to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy \( n \) yogurts.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it checks if \( n \) is odd or even.
- It compares \( 2a \) with \( b \) to decide whether to use the promotion price or the regular price.
- It prints the minimum cost for each test case.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) from the input.

2. **Promotion vs Regular Price Calculation:**
   - If \( n \) is odd (\( n \% 2 == 1 \)):
     - It checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price (\( 2a \)) is cheaper than buying one yogurt at the regular price (\( a \)).
       - If \( 2a < b \), it means buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper, so it calculates the total cost as \( a \times n \).
       - Otherwise, it uses the promotion price for pairs of yogurts and buys the last yogurt at the regular price: \( n // 2 \times b + a \).
   - If \( n \) is even (\( n \% 2 == 0 \)):
     - It directly checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price (\( 2a \)) is cheaper than buying them at the regular price (\( a \)).
       - If \( 2a < b \), it means buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper, so it calculates the total cost as \( a \times n \).
       - Otherwise, it uses the promotion price for all pairs of yogurts: \( n // 2 \times b \).

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles both even and odd values of \( n \) correctly.
   - It considers the promotion price for buying pairs of yogurts and compares it with the regular price to minimize the cost.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case as required.

#### Verification with Examples:
- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `2 5 9`
  - \( n = 2 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)
  - Since \( n \) is even, we check \( 2a < b \):
    - \( 2 \times 5 = 10 > 9 \), so use the promotion price: \( 2 \times 9 = 18 \) (but since we're buying 2, it's actually \( 9 \)).

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `3 5 9`
  - \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)
  - Since \( n \) is odd, we check \( 2a < b \):
    - \( 2 \times 5 = 10 > 9 \), so use the promotion price for pairs and regular price for the last: \( 1 \times 9 + 1 \times 5 = 14 \).

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `3 5 11`
  - \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \)
  - Since \( n \) is odd, we check \( 2a < b \):
    - \( 2 \times 5 = 10 < 11 \), so use the regular price for all: \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \).

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `4 5 11`
  - \( n = 4 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \)
  - Since \( n \) is even, we check \( 2a < b \):
    - \( 2 \times 5 = 10 < 11 \), so use the regular price for all: \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \).

The program correctly handles all these cases.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

Final: **True**
