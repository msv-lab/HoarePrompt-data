Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it checks if \( n \) is odd or even and compares \( 2a \) with \( b \). Based on these conditions, it prints either \( a \times n \) or \( \frac{n}{2} \times b + a \) if \( n \) is odd, and either \( a \times n \) or \( \frac{n}{2} \times b \) if \( n \) is even. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.**
