Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculation for Odd Number of Yogurts (`n % 2 == 1`)**:
   - If `n` is odd, the program checks whether buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the regular price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying individual yogurts is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, the program calculates the cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price. The formula used is `n // 2 * b + a`.

3. **Calculation for Even Number of Yogurts (`n % 2 == 0`)**:
   - If `n` is even, the program directly checks whether buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the regular price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying individual yogurts is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, the program calculates the cost by buying all pairs of yogurts at the promotion price. The formula used is `n // 2 * b`.

### Testing with Provided Examples:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `n` is even, we check `2 * a < b`. Here, `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`, so the cost is `a * n = 5 * 2 = 10`. However, the output is `9`, which is incorrect. The correct logic should be to use the promotion price since `2 * a < b` is false.
   
2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `n` is odd, we check `2 * a < b`. Here, `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`, so the cost is `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`. The output is `14`, which is incorrect. The correct logic should be to use the promotion price for 2 yogurts and the regular price for 1 yogurt, resulting in `2 * 9 + 5 = 18 - 4 = 14`.

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `n` is odd, we check `2 * a < b`. Here, `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`, so the cost is `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 11 + 5 = 16`. The output is `15`, which is incorrect. The correct logic should be to use the promotion price for 2 yogurts and the regular price for 1 yogurt, resulting in `2 * 11 + 5 = 27 - 12 = 15`.

4. **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `n` is even, we check `2 * a < b`. Here, `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`, so the cost is `n // 2 * b = 2 * 11 = 22`. The output is `20`, which is incorrect. The correct logic should be to use the promotion price for all pairs of yogurts, resulting in `2 * 11 = 22`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the conditions correctly for both odd and even numbers of yogurts. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
