Output State: **`trumps` is a sorted list of the ranks (strings) from the original `trumps` list.**

Explanation: The code `trumps = sorted(trumps)` sorts the list `trumps` in ascending order. Since the initial state of `trumps` is a list of ranks (strings) with at most one element, after sorting, `trumps` will still contain the same elements but in sorted order. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `trump suit`, `answers`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
