Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, `trumps` is a list of ranks (strings) with at most one element, `answers` is a list of strings where for each suit that appears more than once in the input, the value is a string with the sorted ranks of that suit concatenated with the suit itself, and for suits that do not appear more than once, their value remains `None`. If there were no possible valid answers due to an empty `trumps` list, the loop prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns before modifying `answers`.
