Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial conditions for `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they are only defined within the context of each test case, which has not yet been specified in the code provided.
