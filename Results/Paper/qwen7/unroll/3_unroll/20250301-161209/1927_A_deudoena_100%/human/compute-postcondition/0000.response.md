Output State: **`ma` is 0, `mi` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `ma` and `mi`, both to 0. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their preconditions. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `ma` and `mi`, while retaining the original conditions for `t`, `n`, and `s`.
