Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. The initial values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
