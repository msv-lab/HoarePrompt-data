Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5), and a list of n integers a where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The function returns different outputs based on the given inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and an array of integers. It processes these inputs and produces an output for each test case according to the defined conditions.
