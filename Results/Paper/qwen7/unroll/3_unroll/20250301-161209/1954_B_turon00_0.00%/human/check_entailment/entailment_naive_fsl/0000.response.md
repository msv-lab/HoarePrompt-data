Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing fewer elements than it currently checks. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
4
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

The program should output `1` because we can remove the element at index 2 (value 1) to make the array `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful. However, the current implementation does not consider this possibility. Instead, it calculates the minimum number of consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp` and outputs that as the result. This approach fails to account for the possibility of making the array non-beautiful by removing a single element that breaks the beauty condition.

To fix this, the program needs to check for the possibility of breaking the beauty condition by removing a single element and ensure that it returns the correct minimum number of removals needed.
