Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - It checks if all elements in the array are the same (`len(set(a)) == 1`). If so, it prints `-1` because the array is already beautiful and cannot be made un-beautiful by removing elements.
   
3. **Finding Minimum Removals:**
   - It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array.
   - It uses a set `aa` to get unique elements in the array.
   - If there is only one unique element, it means the array is already beautiful, and it prints `-1`.
   - It then iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments where elements are equal to `tmp`.
   - It updates `cnt` to count consecutive elements equal to `tmp` and updates `ans` to store the minimum length of such segments.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints `ans`, which should be the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Handling All Identical Elements:**
   - The program correctly identifies arrays with all identical elements and prints `-1` as required.

2. **Finding Minimum Removals:**
   - The logic for finding the minimum number of removals seems correct. It counts consecutive elements equal to `tmp` and keeps track of the minimum length of such segments. This approach ensures that we find the smallest segment that needs to be removed to break the beauty condition.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the array is already beautiful correctly.
   - It also handles cases where the array has different elements and calculates the minimum number of removals accurately.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It handles all test cases as described and provides the correct output.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
