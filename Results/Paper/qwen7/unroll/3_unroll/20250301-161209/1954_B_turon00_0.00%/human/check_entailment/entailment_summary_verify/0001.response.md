### Reasoning

The original assessment provided a detailed step-by-step analysis of the given program and concluded that it correctly implements the solution to the problem. However, let's re-evaluate the program to ensure its correctness and completeness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program correctly checks if all elements in the array are the same using `len(set(a)) == 1`. If so, it prints `-1` because the array is already beautiful and cannot be made un-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Finding Minimum Removals:**
   - The program initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and uses a set `aa` to get unique elements in the array. However, this set is not used effectively in the subsequent logic.
   - The program iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments where elements are equal to `tmp`. This part of the logic is correct and ensures that we find the smallest segment that needs to be removed to break the beauty condition.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

However, there is a critical issue with the logic for finding the minimum number of removals. The program does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition. Instead, it finds the minimum length of consecutive segments where elements are equal to `tmp`, which is not the same as the minimum number of elements to remove.

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- Input: `5 1 2 1 2 1`
- The program would find that the minimum length of consecutive segments where elements are equal to `1` is `3`, but the correct answer is `1` because removing the element at index `2` (value `2`) breaks the beauty condition.

### Correct Solution

A correct solution would involve identifying the longest segment of consecutive elements that are the same and then calculating the number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Find the longest segment of consecutive elements that are the same
        max_length = 1
        current_length = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] == a[i-1]:
                current_length += 1
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            else:
                current_length = 1
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of elements to remove
        if max_length == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(n - max_length)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Final Evaluation

Given the above analysis, the original program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for finding the minimum number of removals is flawed.

**Final: False**
