You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif k % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            f = k - q
            while f & f - 1 != 0:
                l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')
                p = len(l)
                q = 2 ** (p - 1)
                f = f - q
            print(f)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases where for each case, two integers \( n \) and \( m \) are provided. It calculates the absolute difference \( k \) between \( n \) and \( m \). Depending on the value of \( k \), it prints one of three possible outcomes: if \( k \) is a power of 2, it prints \( k \); if \( k \) is odd, it prints 1; otherwise, it finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \), subtracts it from \( k \), and repeats the process until \( k \) becomes a power of 2 or 1, then prints the final value of \( k \). The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length of the longest common subsegment between two sequences \(a\) and \(b\), where \(a_n = n \oplus x\) and \(b_n = n \oplus y\).
   - The key observation here is that the XOR operation has a periodicity related to the binary representation of the difference \(k = |x - y|\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The function `func()` takes an integer input `t`, which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) (which are actually \(x\) and \(y\) from the problem statement).
   - It calculates \(k = |n - m|\).
   - The code checks if \(k\) is a power of 2 using the condition `if k & k - 1 == 0`. If true, it prints \(k\).
   - If \(k\) is not a power of 2 and is odd, it prints 1.
   - If \(k\) is even, it finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\) and subtracts it, repeating until it finds the correct length.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The length of the longest common subsegment is determined by the periodicity of the XOR operation, which is directly related to the binary representation of \(|x - y|\).
   - The code correctly identifies powers of 2 and handles other cases appropriately.
   - The logic for finding the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\) and adjusting \(k\) is sound.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the length of the longest common subsegment based on the properties of the XOR operation.
