Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases where for each case, two integers \( n \) and \( m \) are provided. It calculates the absolute difference \( k \) between \( n \) and \( m \). Depending on the value of \( k \), it prints one of three possible outcomes: if \( k \) is a power of 2, it prints \( k \); if \( k \) is odd, it prints 1; otherwise, it finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \), subtracts it from \( k \), and repeats the process until \( k \) becomes a power of 2 or 1, then prints the final value of \( k \). The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
