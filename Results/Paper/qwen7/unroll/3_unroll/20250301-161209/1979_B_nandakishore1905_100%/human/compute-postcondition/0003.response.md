Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and for each test case, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers between 0 and 10^9. The function returns different outputs based on the comparison of `x` and `y`: if `x` is less than `y`, it returns "x < y"; if `x` is greater than `y`, it returns "x > y"; if `x` is equal to `y`, it returns "x == y".**

Note: The actual return values depend on the comparison of `x` and `y` within the function body, but since the function signature does not include these parameters, the description focuses on the constraints and expected behavior based on the provided constraints.
