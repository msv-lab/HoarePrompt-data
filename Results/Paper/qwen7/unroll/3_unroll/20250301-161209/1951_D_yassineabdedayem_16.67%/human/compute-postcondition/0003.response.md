Output State: The value of `t` integers are processed according to the given loop. For each integer `n` and `k`, if it's possible to repeatedly subtract multiples of `k` from `n` until `n` becomes less than `k` or `rep` (the number of iterations) reaches 60, then "YES" is printed followed by the length of the list `tab` and the elements of `tab`. Otherwise, "NO" is printed. Here, `tab` contains the sequence of numbers chosen during each iteration.
