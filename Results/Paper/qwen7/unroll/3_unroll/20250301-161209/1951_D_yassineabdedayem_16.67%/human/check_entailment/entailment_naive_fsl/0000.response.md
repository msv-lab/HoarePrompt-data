Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Specifically, the program attempts to distribute the number of jewels Alice can buy across stalls, but it does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in all cases. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
7 3
```
The program's output is:
```
YES
1
7
```
However, this is incorrect because Alice would buy only 1 jewel at the first stall, leaving her with 6 coins, which is not enough to buy any more jewels. Therefore, Alice would buy only 1 jewel, not 3.

A correct approach would involve setting up stalls in such a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. For example, if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, we could set up stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. The provided solution does not ensure this behavior in all cases.
