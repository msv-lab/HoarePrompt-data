Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three values: t (a positive integer between 1 and 1000), n (a positive integer between 1 and 10^18), and k (a positive integer between 1 and 10^18). It returns a result based on the relationship between n, k, and t.**

This means the function indirectly takes t, n, and k as inputs, where t is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, and both n and k are positive integers within the range of 1 to 10^18. The function then determines and returns a result based on the values of n, k, and t.
