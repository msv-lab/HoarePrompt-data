Output State: The output state depends on the values of `n` and `k` for each iteration. If `k` becomes 0 before `n` reaches 0 or after 60 iterations, it prints 'YES' followed by the length of `tab` and the elements in `tab`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. `tab` will contain strings representing the values of `number` chosen in each iteration until `k` becomes 0 or `n` is no longer divisible by `k` under the given constraints.
