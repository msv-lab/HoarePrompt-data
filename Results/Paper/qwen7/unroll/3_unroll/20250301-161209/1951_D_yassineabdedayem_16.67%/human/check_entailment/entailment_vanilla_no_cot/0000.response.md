Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem but does not correctly simulate the greedy behavior of Alice buying jewels from the stalls. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `Min` and `Max`:**
   - The logic for calculating `Min` and `Max` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if Max == k and n * Min <= k:` does not accurately reflect the scenario where Alice would buy the maximum possible jewels from the current stall.
   - The variable `number` should be assigned the value of `Max` or `Min` based on the remaining coins and the target number of jewels `k`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Remaining Coins:**
   - The line `n -= Min * Max` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the actual number of jewels Alice buys from the current stall. Instead, it should be `n -= number * number`.

3. **Handling of Remaining Jewels `k`:**
   - The decrement of `k` should be done based on the actual number of jewels bought, which is `number`, not `Min` or `Max`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        stalls = []
        rep = 0
        
        while n > 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60:
            price = min(n // k, 10**18)
            stalls.append(price)
            n -= price * k
            k -= price
            rep += 1
        
        if k == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(rep)
            print(' '.join(map(str, stalls)))
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- Alice buys the maximum possible jewels from each stall.
- The number of stalls and their prices are correctly calculated.
- The loop terminates when either Alice buys the required number of jewels or the maximum number of stalls (60) is reached.
