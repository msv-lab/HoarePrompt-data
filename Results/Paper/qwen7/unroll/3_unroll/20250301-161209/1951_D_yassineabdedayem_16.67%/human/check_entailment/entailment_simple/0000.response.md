### Reasoning:

The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by simulating Alice's greedy behavior of buying jewels from stalls. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `Min` and `Max`:**
   - The logic for calculating `Min` and `Max` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if Max == k and n * Min <= k:` is incorrect and unnecessary. Instead, we should directly calculate how many jewels Alice can buy from the current stall and update the remaining coins and desired jewels accordingly.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Coins and Desired Jewels:**
   - The logic inside the while loop is not correctly updating the remaining coins (`n`) and the desired number of jewels (`k`). The current implementation may lead to incorrect results or infinite loops.

3. **Potential Infinite Loop:**
   - If the conditions are not properly handled, the program might enter an infinite loop, especially when the remaining coins are not sufficient to buy the desired number of jewels.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The output format needs to be consistent with the problem statement. The program should print "YES" or "NO" followed by the appropriate details if the answer is "YES".

Given these issues, let's analyze the provided solution and determine its correctness.

### Corrected Solution:

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        
        stalls = []
        rep = 0
        
        while n > 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60:
            price = min(k, n // k)  # Price per jewel for the current stall
            stalls.append(price)
            n -= price * k  # Update remaining coins after buying jewels
            k -= price  # Decrease the desired number of jewels
            rep += 1
        
        if k == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(len(stalls))
            print(' '.join(map(str, stalls)))
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:

1. **Initialization:**
   - We initialize the number of stalls to zero and create an empty list `stalls` to store the prices.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - We use a while loop to simulate Alice's behavior of buying jewels from stalls.
   - In each iteration, we calculate the price per jewel for the current stall as the minimum of `k` and `n // k`.
   - We update the remaining coins (`n`) and the desired number of jewels (`k`) after Alice buys the jewels.
   - We increment the number of stalls (`rep`).

3. **Termination Conditions:**
   - The loop continues until either Alice has no more coins (`n == 0`), she has bought the required number of jewels (`k == 0`), or she has set up 60 stalls (`rep == 60`).

4. **Output:**
   - If Alice has bought exactly `k` jewels, we print "YES" followed by the number of stalls and the prices.
   - Otherwise, we print "NO".

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the original solution had logical errors and potential issues with handling the problem constraints. The corrected solution addresses these issues and should work correctly according to the problem statement.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
