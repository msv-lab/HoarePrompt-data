Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it takes two integers \( n \) and \( k \) and determines whether it is possible to repeatedly subtract multiples of \( k \) from \( n \) until \( n \) becomes less than \( k \) or a maximum of 60 iterations have been performed. If this condition is met, it prints "YES" followed by the count of iterations and the sequence of numbers used in each iteration. Otherwise, it prints "NO". The function implicitly accepts the number of test cases \( t \) as input and does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.**
