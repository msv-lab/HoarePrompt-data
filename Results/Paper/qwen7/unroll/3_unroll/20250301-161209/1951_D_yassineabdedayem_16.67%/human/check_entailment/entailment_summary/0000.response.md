Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels using her \( n \) coins. The solution should output "YES" with the number of stalls and their respective prices if possible, or "NO" if it's not possible within 60 stalls.

2. **Execution Summary Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It attempts to find a sequence of prices such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.
   - The logic inside the loop seems to try to find a way to distribute \( n \) coins among stalls to meet the requirement of buying exactly \( k \) jewels.
   - However, the logic inside the loop does not correctly simulate the process of Alice buying jewels greedily from each stall. Specifically, the logic to determine the number of jewels Alice buys from each stall is flawed. It incorrectly calculates the number of jewels to buy and the remaining coins after each purchase.

3. **Flaws in the Code**:
   - The calculation of `Min` and `Max` is incorrect. The code tries to find a balance between the minimum and maximum possible values but does not correctly simulate the greedy buying process.
   - The condition `if Max == k and n * Min <= k:` is not necessary and does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.
   - The logic for updating `n`, `k`, and `tab` is not correctly reflecting the greedy buying process.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
