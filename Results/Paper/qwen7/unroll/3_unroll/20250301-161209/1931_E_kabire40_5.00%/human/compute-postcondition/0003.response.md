Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes inputs through a list of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by pairs of integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^6), and a list a containing n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns specific outputs based on the values of n, m, and the list a.**
