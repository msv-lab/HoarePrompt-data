Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for y in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved here are `y` and the result of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `y` is a variable that will take on values from the range generated by `range(int(input()))`.
   - `int(input())` is the input value that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `y` is less than the value of `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `y` starts at 0 (the default starting point of the `range` function), the loop will start with `y = 0`.
   - The value of `int(input())` is not known until runtime, but we know it must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

**State:**
- `y` is 0.
- The value of `int(input())` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

Putting this together, the final state is:

**State: **`y` is 0, int(input()) must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\)**.
