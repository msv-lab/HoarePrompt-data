Output State: Sasha or Anna, depending on the input values provided during the loop executions. The final output will be either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' based on the comparison between `rev_res` and `10 ** int(max_power)`. If `rev_res` is greater than `10 ** int(max_power)`, 'Sasha' is printed; otherwise, 'Anna' is printed.
