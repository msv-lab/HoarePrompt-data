Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the integer `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - The initial value of `wins` (which is 0) does not affect the loop's execution condition.
   - The variable `t` (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) does not affect the loop's execution condition either.
   - The variable `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n) does not affect the loop's execution condition.
   - The list `a` (a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i's are distinct) does not affect the loop's execution condition.

Given these points, the only variables that need adjustment are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:
- `i` should be initialized to 0.
- `n` must be at least 1.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1**
