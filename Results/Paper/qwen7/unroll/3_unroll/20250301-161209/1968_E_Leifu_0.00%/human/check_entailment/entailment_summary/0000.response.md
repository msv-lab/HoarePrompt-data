Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze it against the problem statement and the provided examples.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program should output a configuration of \(n\) cells that achieves this maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
   - It always prints "1 1" and "1 2", which are two cells.
   - If `n` is 3, it additionally prints "2 3".
   - Otherwise, it prints "2 4" and then a sequence of pairs from "4 4" to "n n".

3. **Verification Against Examples**:
   - For \(n = 2\): The program outputs "1 1" and "1 2", which matches the example.
   - For \(n = 3\): The program outputs "1 1", "1 2", and "2 3", which also matches the example.
   - For \(n = 4\): The program outputs "1 1", "1 2", "2 4", and "4 4", "4 5", "4 6", "4 7", "4 8". However, the example shows a different configuration: "1 1", "1 3", "4 3", "4 4". This suggests the program might not be maximizing \(\mathcal{H}\) correctly for \(n = 4\).
   - For \(n = 5\): The program outputs "1 1", "1 2", "2 4", "5 5", "5 6", "5 7", "5 8", "5 9". Again, this does not match the example configuration.
   - For \(n = 6\): The program outputs "1 1", "1 2", "2 4", "6 1", "6 2", "6 3", "6 4", "6 5", "6 6". This also does not match the example configuration.

Given these observations, the program does not consistently produce the configurations that maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
