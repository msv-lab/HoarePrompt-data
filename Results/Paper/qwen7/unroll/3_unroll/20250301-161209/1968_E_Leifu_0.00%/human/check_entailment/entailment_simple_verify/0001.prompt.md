You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between pairs of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program needs to output a configuration of \(n\) cells that achieves this.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It always prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which will always contribute a Manhattan distance of 1.
   - If `n` is 3, it adds the point `(2, 3)`, contributing additional distances.
   - For `n > 3`, it prints `(1, 4)` and then prints points `(j, j)` for `j` from 4 to `n`.

3. **Checking for Distinct Manhattan Distances**:
   - For \(n = 2\): The points are \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\). The Manhattan distance is 1. This is correct as \(\mathcal{H} = \{1\}\).
   - For \(n = 3\): The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\). The distances are 1, 2, and 3. This is correct as \(\mathcal{H} = \{1, 2, 3\}\).
   - For \(n > 3\):
     - The points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) contribute a distance of 1.
     - The point \((2, 4)\) contributes a distance of 3.
     - Points \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\) will contribute distances of \(j-1\) and \(2(j-1)\).

4. **Verification**:
   - For \(n = 4\):
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\).
     - Distances: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
     - \(\mathcal{H} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\).
   - For \(n = 5\):
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\).
     - Distances: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
     - \(\mathcal{H} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\).

The program correctly handles all test cases within the given constraints and produces the required output to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.
