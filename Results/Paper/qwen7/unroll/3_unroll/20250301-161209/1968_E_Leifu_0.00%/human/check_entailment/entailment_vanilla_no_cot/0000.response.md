Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\). Specifically, the program only handles \(n=3\) and \(n=4\) partially correctly and fails for other values of \(n\).

For example, consider \(n=5\):
- The program outputs:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  2 4
  4 4
  5 5
  ```
- This does not cover all possible Manhattan distances for \(n=5\). A better configuration would include points like \((1,1)\), \((1,3)\), \((4,3)\), \((4,4)\), and \((5,5)\), which maximizes the number of unique distances.

Similarly, for \(n=6\), the output is also suboptimal. A better configuration should include points that generate more unique Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all test cases.
