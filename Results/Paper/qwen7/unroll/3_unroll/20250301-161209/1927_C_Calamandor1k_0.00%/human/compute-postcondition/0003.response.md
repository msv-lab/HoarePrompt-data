Output State: The output state will consist of "YES" or "NO" printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified within the loop. For each test case (determined by the value of `t`), the program checks two lists `a` and `b` against the threshold `k` and prints "YES" if at least half of the elements in both lists are less than or equal to `k`, otherwise it prints "NO".
