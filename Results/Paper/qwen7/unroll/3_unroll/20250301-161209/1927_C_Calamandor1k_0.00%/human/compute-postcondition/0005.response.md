Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads integers t, n, m, k, and two arrays a and b. It then checks if at least half of the elements in both arrays a and b are less than or equal to the integer k. If this condition is met for both arrays, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This process is repeated for each of the t test cases.**
