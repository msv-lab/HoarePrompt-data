Reasoning:
1. The problem requires outputting the minimum and maximum of two integers for each test case.
2. The annotated program defines a function `func()` which reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, and prints the minimum followed by the maximum.
3. The logic inside the loop correctly compares `x` and `y` and prints them in the required order.
4. The program handles multiple test cases as specified by the number `t`.
5. Given the constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9), the program should work correctly within these bounds.

Based on the above reasoning, the provided program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
