You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. Additionally, the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        sum, r = 0, 0
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
                r = i
                sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
            else:
                sum += i * n
        
        print(sum, n + r)
        
        for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
            if j <= n:
                print(1, j, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))
            else:
                print(2, j % n, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to one iteration of the outer loop. For each iteration, there will be two lines:
    #
    #1. The first line contains two integers: the value of `sum` and `n + r`.
    #2. The second line contains either `n` or `n + r` lines, each representing a sequence of numbers. Each line starts with either `1` or `2`, followed by a space-separated list of numbers from `1` to `n`.
    #
    #For each iteration, `sum` is calculated based on the given logic, and `r` is determined by the condition in the inner loop. The exact values of `sum` and `r` depend on the input `n` for each iteration. The second part of the output generates a specific pattern of numbers based on the values of `n` and `r`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two integers: t and n. The function validates that t is between 1 and 500 inclusive, and n is between 1 and 500 inclusive. Additionally, the sum of n^2 across all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. For each valid test case, the function performs some unspecified operation (since the specific operation is not detailed), and returns the result(s) accordingly.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
