Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( t \) and \( n \). For each test case, it calculates a sum based on specific conditions and determines a value \( r \). It then prints the sum and \( n + r \) for each test case. Following this, it generates a pattern of numbers, printing either \( n \) or \( n + r \) lines, each starting with either `1` or `2` and followed by a sequence of numbers from `1` to \( n \). The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.**
