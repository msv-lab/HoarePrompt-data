Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`, the value of `t` remains within this range after the code is executed. The other conditions and constraints (such as the sum of `n^2` over all test cases) remain unchanged and are still valid.
