Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The logic in the `if-elif-else` block is flawed and does not account for all possible scenarios where the maximum number of fireworks can be seen.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which represents the interval at which both installations launch fireworks at the same time. We then need to calculate how many fireworks can be seen within this interval and adjust for overlaps.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate LCM of a and b
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)
        
        # Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within one LCM interval
        fireworks_a = lcm_ab // a
        fireworks_b = lcm_ab // b
        
        # Calculate the total number of unique fireworks seen
        total_fireworks = fireworks_a + fireworks_b - 1  # Subtract 1 to avoid double-counting the overlap
        
        # Add the fireworks that can be seen during the overlap period
        total_fireworks += min(lcm_ab // (m + 1), m // a + m // b)
        
        print(total_fireworks)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected function calculates the LCM of `a` and `b`, then determines the number of fireworks launched by each installation within one LCM interval. It adjusts for overlaps and adds the fireworks that can be seen during the overlap period, ensuring the correct maximum number of fireworks is calculated.
