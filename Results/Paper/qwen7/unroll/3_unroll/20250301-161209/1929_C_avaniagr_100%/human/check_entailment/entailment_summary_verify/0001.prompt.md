You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (k, x, a) = map(int, s.split())
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 2:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = k - 2
            for i in range(x - k + 3):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads input from standard input, processes each line containing integers k, x, and a, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions. For each line, if x is less than k-1, it checks if a is greater than or equal to x+1. If x equals k-1, it checks if a is greater than or equal to x+2. Otherwise, it calculates a value z using a specific formula and checks if a is greater than or equal to z. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each line of input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads from standard input and parses the input values `k`, `x`, and `a` from each test case.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks different conditions based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`:
     - If `x < k - 1`:
       - It checks if `a >= x + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
     - If `x == k - 1`:
       - It checks if `a >= x + 2`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
     - If `x > k - 1`:
       - It calculates `z` using a loop and checks if `a >= z`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

3. **Calculation of `z`:**
   - The calculation of `z` in the loop seems to be an attempt to determine the minimum number of coins needed to ensure Sasha can win enough times to accumulate any desired number of coins.
   - The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is used within the loop, which iterates `x - k + 3` times.

### Detailed Explanation of `z` Calculation

- **Initial Value of `z`:**
  - Initially, `z` is set to `k - 2`.

- **Loop Iteration:**
  - The loop runs `x - k + 3` times.
  - In each iteration, `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to itself.

### Correctness Verification

1. **Case `x < k - 1`:**
   - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can always win enough times to get any number of coins because he can place a bet of 1 coin after a loss.
   - The condition `a >= x + 1` ensures that Sasha has enough coins to start with at least one win.

2. **Case `x == k - 1`:**
   - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha can still win enough times to get any number of coins because he can place a bet of 1 coin after a loss.
   - The condition `a >= x + 2` ensures that Sasha has enough coins to start with at least two wins.

3. **Case `x > k - 1`:**
   - The loop calculates `z` to determine the minimum number of coins needed to ensure Sasha can win enough times.
   - The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is used to simulate the growth of Sasha's coins over multiple wins and losses.
   - The condition `a >= z` checks if Sasha has enough initial coins to reach the calculated value `z`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all cases and uses the correct conditions to determine if Sasha can achieve his goal.
