Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It checks if the given conditions (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9) are met and returns appropriate values based on these conditions.**

Note: The provided code snippet does not actually include any parameters in the function definition, so the function itself does not accept any parameters. The conditions mentioned are likely intended to be checked within the function's body, but since they are not part of the function signature, they are not parameters of the function.
