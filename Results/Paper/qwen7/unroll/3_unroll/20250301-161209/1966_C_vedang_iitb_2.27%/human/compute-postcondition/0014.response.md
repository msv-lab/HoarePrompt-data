The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is a list of `n` non-negative integers representing the number of stones in each of the `n` piles, and `n`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Based on the given cases, the function returns either 1 or 2.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers and an integer `n`. It returns 1 in four cases and 2 in one case.**
