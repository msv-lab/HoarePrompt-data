Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if Bob can form a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
2. The provided solution checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If at least one of them is even, it prints 'Yes', indicating that a different rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
3. This logic is correct because:
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with at least one side being even. These smaller rectangles can then be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the only way to cut the rectangle is into two \(1 \times \frac{a+b}{2}\) rectangles, which cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle since all resulting pieces would still have odd dimensions.
4. The provided code correctly implements this logic and handles the constraints specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
