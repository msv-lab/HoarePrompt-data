Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If either dimension is even, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - According to the problem statement, Bob can form a new rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them.
   - The key insight here is that if either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with at least one even side, allowing him to rearrange them into a different rectangle.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When both `a` and `b` are odd, the only way to cut the rectangle is into two 1x1 squares, which do not allow forming a different rectangle.
   - The logic in the program correctly identifies this scenario and returns 'No' for such cases.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case, which matches the required format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Bob can form a different rectangle from the given dimensions. The conditions and logic align perfectly with the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
