Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining if Bob can form a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
2. The key observation is that if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always form a different rectangle. This is because:
   - If \(a\) is even, we can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of dimensions \(a/2 \times b\).
   - If \(b\) is even, we can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of dimensions \(a \times b/2\).
3. The provided solution checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`. If this condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that a different rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
4. The logic in the code matches the problem statement and the provided examples. It correctly handles all edge cases where at least one dimension is even, allowing the formation of a different rectangle.
5. The code iterates over each test case, reading the values of \(a\) and \(b\) for each case and applying the same logic.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
