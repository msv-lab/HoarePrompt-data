Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), an integer representing the size of the array a, followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n), where the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. After executing the loop, if cntl[0] is not zero, then the minimum value of j for which cntl[j] is less than 2 or j equals n is printed; otherwise, 0 is printed.
