Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the size of an array `a`, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, it checks if the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5 and ensures that `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. It then returns whether the conditions are met for processing the test cases.**
