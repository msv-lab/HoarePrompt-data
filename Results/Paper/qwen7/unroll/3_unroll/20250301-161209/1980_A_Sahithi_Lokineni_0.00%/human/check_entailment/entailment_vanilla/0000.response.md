Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then processes each test case using a while loop.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It reads the string `s` which represents the difficulties of the existing problems.

2. **Counting Problem Difficulties:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` initialized with a default value (which is not defined in the code snippet).
   - It iterates over the string `s` and counts the occurrences of each difficulty level.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Problems Needed:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the keys of the dictionary `d` (which represent the difficulty levels).
   - For each difficulty level, it checks if the count of that level is less than or equal to `m`.
   - If true, it adds `m - d[val]` to `ans`. This calculation is incorrect because it assumes we can reuse the same problem across multiple rounds, but the problem requires unique problems per round.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Issues Identified:
- The key issue is in the logic used to calculate `ans`. The current implementation incorrectly assumes that problems can be reused across rounds, which is not allowed according to the problem statement. We need to ensure that each difficulty level has at least `m` problems available.
- The `default_value` is not defined in the code, which will cause an error when initializing the `defaultdict`.

### Corrected Logic:
To fix this, we need to check how many problems of each difficulty level are missing to meet the requirement of `m` rounds. Hereâ€™s the corrected approach:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)  # Initialize with int instead of default_value
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical errors and an undefined variable. After fixing these issues, the program should work correctly. However, based on the provided code snippet, the program is currently incorrect due to the logical flaw.

**Correctness: False**
