Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in how it calculates the number of additional problems needed. The code initializes `d` with an undefined `default_value`, which will lead to an error because `defaultdict` requires a default value to be specified when it is initialized. Additionally, the logic for calculating the number of additional problems needed is flawed. 

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)  # Initialize with default value 0
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1  # Increment the count for each character
    ans = 0
    for key in d.keys():
        if d[key] < m:  # If the count of a difficulty level is less than m
            ans += m - d[key]  # Add the difference to the answer
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version initializes the `defaultdict` with `int` and correctly calculates the number of additional problems needed to ensure that each round can have one problem of each required difficulty level.
