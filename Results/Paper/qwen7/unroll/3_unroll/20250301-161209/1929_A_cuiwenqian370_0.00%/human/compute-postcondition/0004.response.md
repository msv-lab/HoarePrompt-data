Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `left <= right`.

2. **Determine the current state of the variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `left` is currently 0.
   - `right` is currently `n - 1`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `left <= right` must be true.
   - Given that `left` is 0 and `right` is `n - 1`, the condition `0 <= n - 1` is always true as long as `n` is a positive integer.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the condition `left <= right` is already satisfied with the given values of `left` and `right`, no adjustments are needed to make the loop execute the first time.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`left` is 0, `right` is n - 1, `arr` is a list of n integers sorted in ascending order, `new_arr` is an empty list**
