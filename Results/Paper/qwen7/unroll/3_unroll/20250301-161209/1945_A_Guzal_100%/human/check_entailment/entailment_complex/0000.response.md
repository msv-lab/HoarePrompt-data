Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate participants based on their preferences.
2. The annotated program correctly processes each test case by:
   - Reading the number of test cases (`n`).
   - For each test case, reading the number of introverts (`a`), extroverts (`b`), and universals (`c`).
   - Calculating the number of tents required using the following logic:
     - Each introvert needs a separate tent, contributing `a` to the total.
     - Extroverts prefer to share tents with two others. The total number of people that can be accommodated by extroverts and universals together is `(b + c)`.
     - If `(b + c)` is divisible by 3, it means all extroverts can be paired up, requiring `(b + c) // 3` tents.
     - If `(b + c)` is not divisible by 3, one additional tent is needed to accommodate the remaining people, contributing `1` to the total.
     - If the condition `b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3` is met, it means there are not enough universals to pair up with the remaining extroverts, making it impossible to accommodate everyone, hence printing `-1`.
3. The program correctly handles all given examples and constraints as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
