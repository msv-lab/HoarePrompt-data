Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously using the formula \(\frac{m}{a} + \frac{m}{b} + 2\). However, this formula is incorrect for determining the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\). The LCM of \(a\) and \(b\) gives the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time would be the number of intervals within \(m + 1\) plus the initial simultaneous launch.

The correct approach involves:
1. Calculating the LCM of \(a\) and \(b\).
2. Determining how many times the LCM fits into \(m + 1\).
3. Adding 1 for the initial simultaneous launch.

The given program's formula \(\frac{m}{a} + \frac{m}{b} + 2\) does not account for the simultaneous launches and the actual intervals between them. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
