Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, after executing the code, `t` will still satisfy this condition, but its specific value will be the one entered by the user. All other variables remain unchanged.
