Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. This involves understanding the timing of fireworks from two different installations and their visibility period.

### Given Program Analysis
The provided function `func()` has the following logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` representing the frequency of launching for the first installation, the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky, respectively.
3. It then prints the value of `m // a + m // b + 2`.

### Correctness Check
To determine if the program is correct, let's break down the logic:
- The expression `m // a + m // b` calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m`.
- Adding `2` accounts for the possibility of fireworks being launched at the exact same time from both installations, which would add an additional pair of fireworks.

However, there is a flaw in this logic:
- The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not correctly account for the simultaneous launches. Specifically, it assumes that the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is simply the sum of individual launches plus 2, which is incorrect because it doesn't consider the overlap between the two sequences.

### Counterexample
Consider the example given in the problem:
- For `a = 6`, `b = 7`, and `m = 4`:
  - The first installation launches fireworks at times: 0, 6, 12, 18, ...
  - The second installation launches fireworks at times: 0, 7, 14, 21, ...
  - Within the first 4 minutes, only the first launch from both installations (at time 0) is visible. Therefore, the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is 1, not 2.

### Correct Solution
The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the interval where fireworks from both installations coincide, and then adjusting the count accordingly.

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the simultaneous launches of fireworks from both installations. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
