Output State: **The program returns a list named 'results' which contains the number of operations required for each test case to ensure that all elements in the subarray starting from the median index are greater than the current median.**

This means that for each test case in `test_cases`, the program has calculated the number of operations needed to make sure all elements in the subarray starting from the median index are greater than the median itself. The results of these calculations are stored in the list `results`, which is then returned by the function.
