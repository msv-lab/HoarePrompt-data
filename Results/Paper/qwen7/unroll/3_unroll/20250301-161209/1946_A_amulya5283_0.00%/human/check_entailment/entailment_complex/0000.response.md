Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case. It handles the input reading efficiently using `sys.stdin.read` and splits the input data into manageable parts.

2. **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, the program correctly sorts the array and identifies the median index. This is done accurately with `median_index = n // 2`.

3. **Heap Usage**: The use of a min-heap (`heapq`) to find the minimum element from the median index onwards is a good approach. However, there's a potential issue in the logic used to increment the elements in the heap. The goal is to make sure all elements from the median index onwards are strictly greater than the current median. The current implementation only increments the smallest element in the heap until it exceeds the current median. This might not always yield the minimum number of operations.

4. **Operations Count**: The operations count logic seems to be flawed. The current approach might not always produce the minimum number of operations because it only increments the smallest element in the heap without considering other elements. For example, if the array is `[2, 2, 8]`, sorting gives `[2, 2, 8]`, and the median is `2`. The current code would increment the smallest element twice, resulting in `[3, 3, 8]`, but the optimal solution would be to increment just once to `[3, 2, 8]`.

5. **Correct Approach**: A more optimal approach would be to calculate the difference between the current median and the next smallest element in the array. If the difference is positive, no operations are needed for that element. Otherwise, the number of operations needed is the difference plus one.

Given these points, the current implementation does not guarantee the minimum number of operations in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
