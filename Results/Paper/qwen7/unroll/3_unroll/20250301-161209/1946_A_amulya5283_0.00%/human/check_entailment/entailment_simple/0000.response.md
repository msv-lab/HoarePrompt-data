Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. An operation consists of incrementing any element in the array by 1.

2. **Key Points in the Solution**:
   - The program reads input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it sorts the array and finds the median.
   - It then uses a min-heap to keep track of the elements from the median position onwards.
   - The program increments the smallest element in the heap until it exceeds the current median and counts the number of operations needed.

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - Sorting the array to find the median is accurate.
   - Using a heap to manage elements from the median position onwards is efficient.
   - Incrementing the smallest element in the heap and counting operations is done correctly.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The code assumes that the median index is always an integer, which is true since we are dealing with integer division.
   - The use of a heap to manage elements from the median position ensures that the smallest element is always accessible efficiently.
   - The logic to increment elements and count operations is sound.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles arrays of different lengths and values within the specified range.
   - It correctly handles cases where the initial median is already the maximum possible value after operations.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

Correctness: **True**
