Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (the length of the array `a`) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (the array `a`). For each test case, the function returns a list named 'results' containing the number of operations required to ensure that all elements in the subarray starting from the median index are greater than the current median.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases where each case involves an array of integers. It calculates the number of operations needed to make sure that all elements from the median index onward in each subarray are greater than the current median value. The results for each test case are then compiled into a list and returned.
