Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Specifically, the program uses a min-heap to increment elements until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum number of operations.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
4
2 2 8 2
5
7 3 3 1 7
2
1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
1
2
1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
2
2
2
```

The issue arises because the program increments elements in the heap without considering the optimal sequence of operations. For example, in the first test case `[2, 2, 8, 2]`, the median is `2`. To increase the median to `3`, only one operation is needed (increase one of the `2`s to `3`). However, the program incorrectly performs two operations.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the optimal sequence of operations, which involves incrementing elements in a way that minimizes the total number of operations. The current implementation does not achieve this.
