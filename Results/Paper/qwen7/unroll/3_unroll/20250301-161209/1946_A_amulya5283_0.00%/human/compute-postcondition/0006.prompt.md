You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer n (the length of the array a) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (the array a). The value of n for each test case satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^5, and each a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n, arr = test_cases[i]
        
        arr.sort()
        
        median_index = n // 2
        
        current_median = arr[median_index]
        
        heap = arr[median_index:]
        
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        
        operations = 0
        
        while heap[0] <= current_median:
            smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
            operations += 1
        
        results.append(operations)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing the number of operations required for each test case to ensure that all elements in the subarray starting from the median index are greater than the current median. Each element in `test_cases` is processed individually, and the operations count for each is appended to `results`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named 'results' which contains the number of operations required for each test case to ensure that all elements in the subarray starting from the median index are greater than the current median.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (the length of the array `a`) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (the array `a`). For each test case, the function returns a list named 'results' containing the number of operations required to ensure that all elements in the subarray starting from the median index are greater than the current median.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list named 'results' which contains the number of operations required for each test case to ensure that all elements in the subarray starting from the median index are greater than the current median.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
