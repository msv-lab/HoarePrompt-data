### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings. This part seems correct as it handles multiple test cases efficiently.

2. **Test Case Parsing**: For each test case, the program correctly extracts the length `n` and the array `arr`, and appends them to `test_cases`. This part is also correct.

3. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1(t, test_cases)` to process each test case. This function is defined and will be checked next.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Sorting and Median Calculation**: The function sorts the array and calculates the median index correctly.
   - **Heap Initialization**: It initializes a heap with elements from the median index onwards. However, this approach is flawed because the heap only contains elements from the median index onwards, but we need to ensure all elements from the median index onwards are greater than the current median. The heap should ideally contain all elements of the array.
   - **Heap Operations**: The loop correctly increments the smallest element in the heap until it exceeds the current median. Each increment counts as one operation. However, since the heap is initialized incorrectly, the loop might not cover all necessary elements.
   - **Result Collection**: The function collects the number of operations required for each test case and returns the results. But due to the incorrect initialization of the heap, the results might not be accurate.

5. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case, which is correct.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles arrays of different lengths and values within the specified range.
   - It correctly deals with the median calculation even when there are duplicate values in the array.
   - However, the heap-based approach is incorrect for ensuring all elements from the median index onwards are greater than the current median.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the heap-based approach used in the function `func_1` is flawed. The heap should contain all elements of the array, not just those from the median index onwards. This flaw means the program might not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
