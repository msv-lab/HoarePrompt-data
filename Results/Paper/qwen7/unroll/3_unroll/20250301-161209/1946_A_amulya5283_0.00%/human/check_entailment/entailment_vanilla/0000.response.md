Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings. This part seems correct as it handles multiple test cases efficiently.

2. **Test Case Parsing**: For each test case, the program correctly extracts the length `n` and the array `arr`, and appends them to `test_cases`. This part is also correct.

3. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1(t, test_cases)` to process each test case. This function is defined and will be checked next.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Sorting and Median Calculation**: The function sorts the array and calculates the median index correctly.
   - **Heap Initialization**: It initializes a heap with elements from the median index onwards. This is intended to simulate the effect of increasing elements to find the minimum operations needed.
   - **Heap Operations**: The loop correctly increments the smallest element in the heap until it exceeds the current median. Each increment counts as one operation.
   - **Result Collection**: The function collects the number of operations required for each test case and returns the results.

5. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case, which is correct.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles arrays of different lengths and values within the specified range.
   - It correctly deals with the median calculation even when there are duplicate values in the array.

Given the above analysis, the program logic appears to be correct according to the problem statement and examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
