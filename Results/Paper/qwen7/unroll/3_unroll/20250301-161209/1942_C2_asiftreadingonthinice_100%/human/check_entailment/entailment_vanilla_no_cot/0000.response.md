Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given solution attempts to solve the problem but contains several logical errors and does not correctly maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake. Here's why:

1. **Initial Calculation of Triangles**: The initial calculation `ans = x + y - 2` is incorrect. This formula assumes that every additional vertex (both chosen by Bessie and you) can form a triangle, which is not always true due to the constraints of the polygon and the requirement for non-intersecting diagonals.

2. **Handling Gaps Between Chosen Vertices**: The logic for handling gaps between chosen vertices (`if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2` and `elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0`) is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that every gap of even length can contribute to forming an additional triangle, which is not necessarily true without considering the overall structure of the polygon.

3. **Edge Cases Not Properly Handled**: The edge cases involving the first and last chosen vertices (`a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]`) are also handled incorrectly. The logic for adding these contributions to the total number of triangles is overly simplistic and does not account for the complex interactions between chosen vertices and the polygon's structure.

4. **Final Adjustment Logic**: The final adjustment logic where it tries to add more triangles using the remaining `y` vertices is also incorrect. It does not properly consider the constraints of non-intersecting diagonals and the need to form valid triangles within the polygon.

To correctly solve this problem, one needs to use a more sophisticated approach, possibly involving graph theory or combinatorial methods to ensure that the formed triangles do not intersect and that the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles is achieved. The given solution does not provide this level of detail or correctness.
