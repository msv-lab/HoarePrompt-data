Functionality: **The function accepts a single parameter t, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case within these t cases, it accepts three integers n, x, and y, where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. Additionally, it accepts x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the chosen vertices. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function takes a count of test cases (t) and for each test case, it processes three integers (n, x, y) along with x distinct integers representing chosen vertices, and then produces an output based on these inputs.
