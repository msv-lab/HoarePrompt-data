Output State: The value of `tt` test cases, followed by `tt` lines where each line contains the minimum value of `ans` calculated for each test case after executing the loop. This minimum value represents the minimum number of operations required to ensure that there exists at least one pair of integers in the list such that their difference is exactly 2, or it is impossible to do so within `n-2` operations.
