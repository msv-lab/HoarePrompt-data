The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers n, x, and y, along with x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates a value `ans` based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list of chosen vertices and adjusts `ans` using the values of x and y. Finally, it prints the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` for each test case.
