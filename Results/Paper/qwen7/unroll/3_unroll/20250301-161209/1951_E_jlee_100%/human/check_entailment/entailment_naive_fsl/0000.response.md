Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly identify partitions for strings where no single non-palindromic substring can be found. 

Consider the input string `aaaa`. According to the problem description, the output should be:

```
NO
```

However, the current implementation will incorrectly output:

```
YES
1
aaaa
```

This is because the program checks if the first character is different from the last character, which is not a sufficient condition for determining whether a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. The program should instead check if there is any substring that is not a palindrome, and if not, conclude that the entire string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it properly identifies cases where no valid partition exists, such as when all characters in the string are the same.
