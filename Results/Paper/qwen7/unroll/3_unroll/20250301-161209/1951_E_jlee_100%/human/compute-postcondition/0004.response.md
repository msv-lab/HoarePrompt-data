Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6. For each test case, it returns information about the string `s` based on certain conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a string `s`. It processes each test case individually, where `t` specifies the number of operations or checks to perform on the string `s`, and `s` is the string to be analyzed. The function does not return a single value but processes each test case according to the given constraints and conditions.
