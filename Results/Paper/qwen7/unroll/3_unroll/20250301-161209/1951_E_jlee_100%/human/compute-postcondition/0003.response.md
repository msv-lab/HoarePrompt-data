Output State: The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each input string `string` of length `n`, the program checks various conditions to determine if the string can be split into two parts such that each part is a palindrome or if the entire string is a palindrome with one character differing from the others. Based on these conditions, the program prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional details if applicable. After processing all `t` strings, the final state of `t` remains unchanged, but the printed outputs (either 'YES' or 'NO' with possible additional details) reflect the results of each string's evaluation.
