You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: Output State: The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each input string `string` of length `n`, the program checks various conditions to determine if the string can be split into two parts such that each part is a palindrome or if the entire string is a palindrome with one character differing from the others. Based on these conditions, the program prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional details if applicable. After processing all `t` strings, the final state of `t` remains unchanged, but the printed outputs (either 'YES' or 'NO' with possible additional details) reflect the results of each string's evaluation.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of a string `s` of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it checks if the string can be split into two palindromic parts or if the entire string is a palindrome with at most one character differing from the others. If such a condition is met, it prints 'YES' along with additional details; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but produces output based on the conditions checked for each string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Initial Checks:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It checks if the length of the string `n` is 1. If so, it prints 'NO' because a single character cannot be split into non-palindromic substrings.

2. **Checking for Non-Palindromic Characters:**
   - It checks if the first character `x` is different from the last character. If they are different, it prints 'YES' and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.
   - It also handles the case where all characters are the same (`s.count(x) == n`). In this case, it prints 'NO' because no non-palindromic partition is possible.

3. **Handling Specific Cases:**
   - If all characters except one are the same (`s.count(x) == n - 1`), it further checks if the middle character is different from `x`. If it is, it prints 'YES' and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.
   - Otherwise, it continues to check for other non-palindromic partitions.

4. **General Case Handling:**
   - It iterates through the string to find a non-matching pair of characters (i.e., `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`). If found, it prints 'YES' and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.
   - If no such pair is found, it looks for a character `x` that appears less than `n` times and splits the string at the first occurrence of a different character. It then checks if the split is valid (i.e., the first part does not contain more than one `x`).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does handle some edge cases like strings with repeated characters and strings where the only non-matching pair is at the ends.
   - However, it may miss some valid partitions, especially for longer strings with specific patterns.

### Example Analysis:

1. **Test Case: "sinktheyacht"**
   - The string is processed, and since 's' is not equal to 't', it prints 'YES' and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.

2. **Test Case: "llllllll"**
   - All characters are the same, so it prints 'NO'.

3. **Test Case: "uwuowouwu"**
   - The string can be split into ["uw", "uow", "ouwu"], which are non-palindromic. The program should recognize this and print 'YES' with the appropriate partition.

### Conclusion:

The program has some logical issues and may not cover all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it might fail to identify valid partitions for certain strings, particularly those with specific patterns of characters.

### Correctness:

Based on the analysis, the program is not fully correct as it may miss valid partitions for certain inputs.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**
