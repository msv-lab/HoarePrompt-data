The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of a string `s` of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it checks if the string can be split into two palindromic parts or if the entire string is a palindrome with at most one character differing from the others. If such a condition is met, it prints 'YES' along with additional details; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but produces output based on the conditions checked for each string.
