Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers `nums` and handles a series of queries defined by pairs of indices `l` and `r`. For each query, it determines a subarray within `nums` and outputs either the start and end indices of a segment within this subarray or (-1, -1) if no valid segment is found. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.**
