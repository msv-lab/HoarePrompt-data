Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n; `input` is set to `sys.stdin.readline`.**

The code simply assigns `sys.stdin.readline` to the variable `input`, which changes how input is read from the standard input. However, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `q` remain unchanged, as does the structure of the queries.
