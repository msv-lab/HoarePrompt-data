You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]

    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n; `nums` is a list of integers with its last element being -1; `s` is equal to `N`; `e` is 0; `num` is the last element of `nums`; `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three elements: the first element is an integer starting from 1 plus the value of `s`, the second element is an integer `i` ranging from 0 to `N`, and the third element is the integer `num` which is consistent throughout each tuple.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    if (ppp == 23) :
        print(nums)
        #This is printed: [-1]
    #State: `LA` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n; `nums` is a list of integers with its last element being -1; `s` is equal to `N`; `e` is 0; `num` is the last element of `nums`; `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three elements: the first element is an integer starting from 1 plus the value of `s`, the second element is an integer `i` ranging from 0 to `N`, and the third element is the integer `num` which is consistent throughout each tuple. The value of `ppp` is 23.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if tc > 5:
            if ppp == 23:
                print(l, r)
            continue
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: The output state depends on the inputs provided during the execution of the loop. For each query (l, r), the output could be one of the following: (-1, -1), (s, e+1) where s and e are determined based on the binary search result. Since the exact inputs are not given, the output cannot be precisely calculated. However, it will consist of multiple lines, each containing either two numbers or two -1s, corresponding to the results of each query.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a predefined list `a` of length `n`, where each element `a_i` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. It also processes a series of queries defined by pairs of integers `l` and `r` (where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n), and for each query, it returns a result based on the subarray of `a` from index `l` to `r` exclusive.
