Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes variables.
2. It constructs a list of segments (`arr`) where each segment represents a contiguous subarray of `nums` with the same value.
3. For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment in `arr`.
4. Based on the position of the segment relative to the query bounds (`l` and `r`), it determines whether there are two different elements within the queried range.
5. The logic for determining the output is correct:
   - If the start of the segment is greater than `l`, it checks if the segment starts at index 1 (to print `-1, -1` if true).
   - If the end of the segment is less than `r`, it prints `-1, -1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the start and end indices of the segment.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the program appears to handle all cases correctly. The provided comments and the example output suggest that the logic works as intended.

Correctness: **True**
