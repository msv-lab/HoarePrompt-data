Postcondition: `is_already_stairs` is False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, `res` is a list containing one tuple `(start_index, start_index)`, and `i` is equal to 0. If `arr[start_index + i]` equals `i`, then `i` is set to 0 and `res` contains one tuple `(start_index, start_index)`. If `arr[start_index + i]` does not equal `i`, then `i` remains unchanged and `res` remains an empty list.
