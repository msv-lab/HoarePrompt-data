Output State: `is_already_stairs` is False, `arr` is a list where each element from `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) is set to `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, `res` is a list containing one tuple `(start_index, start_index)`, and `i` is equal to the length of the modified segment in `arr`.
