Output State: **`is_already_stairs` is False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers with the element at index `start_index` now being 1, `res` is a list containing one tuple (start_index, start_index), and the current value of i is 0.**

This means that the element at the `start_index` in the list `arr` has been changed from its original value to 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The `is_already_stairs` variable remains `False`, `res` still contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`, and `i` is still 0.
