Output State: **`max_diff` is the largest difference found between consecutive elements in the array `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference found, `index` is the index of the element where `max_diff` was found, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is the minimum value among all `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)` for each `f` in `F`.**
