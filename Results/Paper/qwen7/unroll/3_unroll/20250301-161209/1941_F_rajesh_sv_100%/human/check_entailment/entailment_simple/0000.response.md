Reasoning:
1. **Function Definitions and Usage**: The program defines several functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`) but only `func_6` and `func_7` are relevant to solving the problem. `func_1` through `func_5` are either unused or used in a way that doesn't affect the core logic of solving the problem.

2. **Core Logic (`func_6`)**:
   - The function correctly identifies the maximum and second maximum differences in the sorted list of prepared problem complexities.
   - It then iterates over the list of function complexities to find the best possible new problem that minimizes the imbalance.
   - The logic for finding the optimal new problem using binary search on the sorted list of model complexities is sound.

3. **Input Handling (`func_7`)**:
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the number of test cases and calling `func_6` for each one.
   - The input handling logic matches the problem statement requirements.

4. **Data Structures**:
   - The use of `SortedList` and `FenwickTree` is appropriate for efficiently managing and querying the data structures needed to solve the problem.

Given that the core logic (`func_6`) correctly implements the algorithm to find the minimum imbalance by adding at most one problem, and the input handling (`func_7`) is also correct, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
