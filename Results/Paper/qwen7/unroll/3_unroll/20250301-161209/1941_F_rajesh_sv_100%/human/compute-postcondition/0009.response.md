Output State: **`max_diff` is the largest difference found between consecutive elements in the array `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference found, `index` is the index of the element where `max_diff` was found, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value of `max_diff` to the variable `ans`. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, `ans` now holds the value of `max_diff`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
