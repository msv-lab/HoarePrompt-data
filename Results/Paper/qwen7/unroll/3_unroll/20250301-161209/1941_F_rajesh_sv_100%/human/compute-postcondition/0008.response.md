Output State: **`max_diff` is the largest difference found between consecutive elements in the array `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference found, `index` is the index of the element where `max_diff` was found, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`**.

This means that the variables `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` retain their previous values. Additionally, two new variables, `left` and `right`, have been introduced and assigned the values of `A[index - 1]` and `A[index]` respectively.
