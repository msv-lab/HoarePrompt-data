You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This is an interactive problem involving a secret permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) of \( \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\} \). You can ask up to 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation. After finding a pair of indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized, you must print "! i j".
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        maxi = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                maxi = i
        
        arr = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                arr = [i]
            elif res == '=':
                arr.append(i)
        
        mini = arr[0]
        
        for item in arr[1:]:
            print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '>':
                mini = item
        
        print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state is the pair of indices (maxi, mini) that are printed after all the iterations of the loop have finished. These indices represent the pair of elements in the secret permutation \( p \) such that the bitwise XOR of these two elements is maximized.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It interacts with an unspecified secret permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) of \( \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\} \) by making up to 3n queries comparing the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation. After identifying a pair of indices \( i \) and \( j \) where \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized, it prints "! i j" to indicate the indices of the pair.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
