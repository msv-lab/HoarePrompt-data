### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query involves comparing \((p_a \mid p_b)\) with \((p_c \mid p_d)\).

2. **Initial Strategy Analysis**:
   - The provided solution starts by setting `maxi` to 0 and then iteratively checks if swapping `maxi` with another index `i` increases the result of \((p_{maxi} \mid p_{maxi})\) compared to \((p_i \mid p_i)\).
   - If \((p_{maxi} \mid p_{maxi}) < (p_i \mid p_i)\), it updates `maxi` to `i`.
   - This ensures that `maxi` holds the index with the highest value of \((p_{maxi} \mid p_{maxi})\).

3. **Finding Potential Candidates**:
   - After determining the best candidate for `maxi`, the code then finds potential candidates for the second index by checking if \((p_{maxi} \mid p_i) < (p_{maxi} \mid p_j)\) for all \(i \neq j\).
   - It stores these candidates in the list `arr`.

4. **Final Comparison**:
   - The code then compares the potential candidates in `arr` to find the one that gives the maximum XOR value with `maxi`.
   - It prints the indices `maxi` and `mini` as the result.

5. **Query Count**:
   - The initial loop to find `maxi` uses \(n-1\) queries.
   - The loop to find potential candidates in `arr` uses approximately \(n-1\) queries.
   - The final comparison loop uses up to \(n-2\) queries.
   - Total queries: \( (n-1) + (n-1) + (n-2) = 3n - 4 \), which is within the limit of \(3n\).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases where the permutation might be trivial (e.g., `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]`).

However, upon closer inspection, there are issues with the logic used to find the potential candidates and the final comparison:

- **Issue with Finding Potential Candidates**:
  - The code sets `arr` to `[0]` initially and then updates it by checking if \((p_{maxi} \mid p_i) < (p_{maxi} \mid p_i)\). This logic is flawed because it only considers indices where \((p_{maxi} \mid p_i) < (p_{maxi} \mid p_i)\), which is always false. Instead, it should consider indices where \((p_{maxi} \mid p_i) > (p_{maxi} \mid p_j)\) for all \(j \neq i\).

- **Issue with Final Comparison**:
  - The final comparison loop only considers indices in `arr` and does not ensure that the maximum XOR value is found. It should compare all possible pairs of indices to ensure the maximum XOR value is identified.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not guarantee that the maximum XOR value is found. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the strategy to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
