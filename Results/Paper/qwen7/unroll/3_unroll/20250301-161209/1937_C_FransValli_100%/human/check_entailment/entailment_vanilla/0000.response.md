### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query involves comparing \((p_a \mid p_b)\) with \((p_c \mid p_d)\).

2. **Initial Strategy Analysis**:
   - The provided solution starts by setting `maxi` to 0 and then iteratively checks if swapping `maxi` with another index `i` increases the result of \((p_{maxi} \mid p_{maxi})\) compared to \((p_i \mid p_i)\).
   - If \((p_{maxi} \mid p_{maxi}) < (p_i \mid p_i)\), it updates `maxi` to `i`.
   - This ensures that `maxi` holds the index with the highest value of \((p_{maxi} \mid p_{maxi})\).

3. **Finding Potential Candidates**:
   - After determining the best candidate for `maxi`, the code then finds potential candidates for the second index by checking if \((p_{maxi} \mid p_i) < (p_{maxi} \mid p_j)\) for all \(i \neq j\).
   - It stores these candidates in the list `arr`.

4. **Final Comparison**:
   - The code then compares the potential candidates in `arr` to find the one that gives the maximum XOR value with `maxi`.
   - It prints the indices `maxi` and `mini` as the result.

5. **Query Count**:
   - The initial loop to find `maxi` uses \(n-1\) queries.
   - The loop to find potential candidates in `arr` uses approximately \(n-1\) queries.
   - The final comparison loop uses up to \(n-2\) queries.
   - Total queries: \( (n-1) + (n-1) + (n-2) = 3n - 4 \), which is within the limit of \(3n\).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases where the permutation might be trivial (e.g., `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]`).

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the strategy to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Therefore, the solution is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
