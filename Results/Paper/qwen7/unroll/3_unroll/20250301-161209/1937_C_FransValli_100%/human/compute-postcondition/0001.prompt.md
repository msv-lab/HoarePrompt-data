Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: This is an interactive problem involving a secret permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) of \( \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\} \). You can ask up to 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation. After finding a pair of indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized, you must print "! i j".
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    maxi = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            maxi = i
    arr = [0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            arr = [i]
        elif res == '=':
            arr.append(i)
    mini = arr[0]
    for item in arr[1:]:
        print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '>':
            mini = item
    print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
