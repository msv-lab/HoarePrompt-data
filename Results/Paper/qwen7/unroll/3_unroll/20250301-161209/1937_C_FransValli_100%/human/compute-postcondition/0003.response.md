Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It interacts with an unspecified secret permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) of \( \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\} \) by making up to 3n queries comparing the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation. After identifying a pair of indices \( i \) and \( j \) where \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized, it prints "! i j" to indicate the indices of the pair.**
