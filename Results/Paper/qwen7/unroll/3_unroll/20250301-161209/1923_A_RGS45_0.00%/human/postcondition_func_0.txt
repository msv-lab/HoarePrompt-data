The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t`, followed by an integer `n` and a string `arr` consisting of `n` characters (each being '0' or '1'). It then finds the first and last positions of '1' in `arr`, extracts the substring between these positions, and counts the number of '0's in this substring. Finally, it prints the count of '0's for each test case.
