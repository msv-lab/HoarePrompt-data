Reasoning:
1. The problem requires moving chips to the left to form a single block without any free cells between them, minimizing the number of operations.
2. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:
   - The program finds the first and last positions of '1' in the string `arr`.
   - It then extracts the substring between these positions.
   - It counts the number of '0's in this extracted substring.
3. This approach does not ensure that the chips are moved to the leftmost possible positions to form a single block. Instead, it simply counts the free cells between the first and last chip, which is not equivalent to the minimum number of operations needed.
4. The program fails to consider the actual movements of the chips and does not account for the fact that moving a chip to the left might involve multiple steps, depending on the positions of other chips and free cells.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
