Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array a consists of n integers where each integer a_i is in the range [1, 10^6], q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, and each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n, and the function `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.readline`**.

The code `input = sys.stdin.readline` does not change the values of the existing variables but updates the `input` function to use `sys.stdin.readline`. All other conditions and values remain the same as the initial state.
