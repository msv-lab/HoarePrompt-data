Output State: `s` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array `a` consists of elements where each element is a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` for consecutive elements in `nums` with the same value, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, and `e` is 0; `num` is equal to `nums[n-1]`; `arr` is a list containing `-1` followed by tuples `(1 + s, i, num)` for each change in consecutive elements in `nums`.
