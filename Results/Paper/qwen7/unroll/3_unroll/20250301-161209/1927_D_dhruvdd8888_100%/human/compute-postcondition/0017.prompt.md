You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array a consists of n integers where each integer a_i is in the range [1, 10^6], q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, and each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is `N`, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array `a` consists of N+1 tuples where each tuple contains three elements: (1 + starting index, ending index, value at starting index), `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, and `e` is 0; `num` is equal to `nums[N]`; `arr` is a list containing `-1` and N+1 tuples of the form (1 + starting index, ending index, value at starting index).
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the values of `s`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, and `LA` remain unchanged. The loop processes input pairs `(l, r)` and prints output based on conditions, but does not modify any of the given variables.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs including a positive integer t, an integer n, an array a of n integers, an integer q, and q queries represented by pairs of integers l and r. For each query, it checks the range [l, r] within the array a and returns specific information based on the values in that range.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
