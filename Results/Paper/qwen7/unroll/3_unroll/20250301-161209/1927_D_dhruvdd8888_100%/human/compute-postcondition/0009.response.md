Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `N + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 0` because `range(N + 1)` generates values from `0` to `N`.

3. **Determine the value of `N`**: The value of `N` is given as `n`, which is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.

4. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N + 1`. Since `i` starts at `0`, the loop will execute for `i = 0` to `i = N`.

Given this information, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `N + 1`. We need to ensure that `i` starts at `0` and that `N + 1` is valid.

**State after adjustment**:
- `i` should be `0`.
- `N + 1` should be `n + 1` (since `N` is `n`).

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect these values.

**State: **`i` is 0, `N + 1` is `n + 1`**
