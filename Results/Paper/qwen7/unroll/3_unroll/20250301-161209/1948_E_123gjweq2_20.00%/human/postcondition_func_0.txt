The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 40, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * `n`. It populates an array `arr` and a list `cliquess` based on the value of `cliques`, which is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`. After populating `arr`, the function prints the contents of `arr`, the value of `cliques`, and the list `cliquess` filled with zeros. The final state of the program includes the printed values of `arr`, `cliques`, and `cliquess`.
