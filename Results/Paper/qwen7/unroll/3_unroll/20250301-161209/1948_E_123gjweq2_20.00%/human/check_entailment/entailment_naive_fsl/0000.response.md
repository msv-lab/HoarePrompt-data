Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques based on the given constraints. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly handle the assignment of integers to vertices and the formation of cliques according to the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

Here's a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the input \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 4 \). According to the problem description, the graph should be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. However, the current implementation assigns integers to vertices without ensuring that the resulting graph can indeed be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

For example, if the program assigns the integers as follows:
- \( a_1 = 1 \)
- \( a_2 = 2 \)
- \( a_3 = 3 \)
- \( a_4 = 4 \)
- \( a_5 = 5 \)

Then, the edges between vertices would be formed as follows:
- For vertices 1 and 2: \( |1 - 2| + |1 - 2| = 2 \le 4 \) (edge exists)
- For vertices 1 and 3: \( |1 - 3| + |1 - 3| = 4 \le 4 \) (edge exists)
- For vertices 1 and 4: \( |1 - 4| + |1 - 4| = 6 \not\le 4 \) (no edge)
- For vertices 1 and 5: \( |1 - 5| + |1 - 5| = 8 \not\le 4 \) (no edge)
- For vertices 2 and 3: \( |2 - 3| + |2 - 3| = 2 \le 4 \) (edge exists)
- For vertices 2 and 4: \( |2 - 4| + |2 - 4| = 4 \le 4 \) (edge exists)
- For vertices 2 and 5: \( |2 - 5| + |2 - 5| = 6 \not\le 4 \) (no edge)
- For vertices 3 and 4: \( |3 - 4| + |3 - 4| = 2 \le 4 \) (edge exists)
- For vertices 3 and 5: \( |3 - 5| + |3 - 5| = 4 \le 4 \) (edge exists)
- For vertices 4 and 5: \( |4 - 5| + |4 - 5| = 2 \le 4 \) (edge exists)

From this, we can see that vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4 form a clique, but vertex 5 does not connect to any of these vertices within the given constraint. Therefore, the graph cannot be partitioned into just one clique, and the program does not handle this case correctly.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not ensure that the graph can always be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques as required by the problem description.
