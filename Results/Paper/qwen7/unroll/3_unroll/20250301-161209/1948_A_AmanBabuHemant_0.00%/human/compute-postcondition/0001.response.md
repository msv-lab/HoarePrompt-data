Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer and `1 ≤ t ≤ 50`.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range.

Given the initial state where `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, and `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\), we need to ensure that `t` is within the valid range for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be within the range 1 to 50.

**State:**
**`t` must be an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive**
