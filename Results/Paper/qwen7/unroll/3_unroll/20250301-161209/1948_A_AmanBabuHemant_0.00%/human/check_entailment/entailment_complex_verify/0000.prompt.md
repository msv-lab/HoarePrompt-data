You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: t is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, and after the loop executes all iterations, n takes the last value it was assigned within the loop. The variable s is either '110' repeated a number of times such that its length is less than 200, or does not exist if the condition is not met, and the loop prints 'YES' followed by s or 'NO' based on the conditions inside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \) and another positive integer \( n \). For each test case, it checks if \( n \) is even. If \( n \) is odd, it prints 'NO'. If \( n \) is even, it constructs a string \( s \) consisting of '110' repeated \( n/2 \) times. If the length of \( s \) is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by \( s \); otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly generate a string with exactly `n` special characters. According to the problem description, a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. However, the current implementation generates strings that do not necessarily meet this criterion. For example, consider the case when `n = 1`. The program will output "NO", which is correct according to the problem statement. However, for other values of `n`, the generated string may not have exactly `n` special characters. For instance, if `n = 2`, the program outputs "MM" which has 2 special characters, but the logic used to generate the string does not guarantee that exactly `n` characters will be special. A more rigorous approach is needed to ensure that the generated string meets the requirement of having exactly `n` special characters.
