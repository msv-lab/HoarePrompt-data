Output State: t is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, and after the loop executes all iterations, n takes the last value it was assigned within the loop. The variable s is either '110' repeated a number of times such that its length is less than 200, or does not exist if the condition is not met, and the loop prints 'YES' followed by s or 'NO' based on the conditions inside the loop.
