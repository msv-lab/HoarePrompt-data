Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes two integers, t and n, where t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function does not return anything explicitly but seems to perform some operation or series of operations involving these two integers within its scope.**

Note: Based on the given information, the function does not return any value directly. It appears to handle the integers `t` and `n` internally without providing an explicit return statement.
