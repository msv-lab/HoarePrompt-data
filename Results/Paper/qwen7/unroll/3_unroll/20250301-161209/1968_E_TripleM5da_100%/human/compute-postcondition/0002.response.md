Output State: The output will consist of a series of lines where each line contains two integers. For each test case, there will be exactly `n-2` lines starting from "1 1" and "1 2", followed by lines ranging from "3 3" to "n n". The total number of lines for each test case will be `n`. The value of `t` does not affect the output format or content since it only determines how many test cases are processed.
