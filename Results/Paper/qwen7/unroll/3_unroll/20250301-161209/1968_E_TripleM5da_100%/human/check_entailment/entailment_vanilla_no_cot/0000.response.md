Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all values of \( n \). Specifically, the program always prints the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) and then prints points \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\). This approach does not necessarily maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\).

For example, consider \( n = 3 \):
- The program outputs:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  3 3
  4 4
  ```

However, the correct output should include points like \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\) as shown in the problem's example. This will generate a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to strategically place the points to maximize the number of unique Manhattan distances. The provided solution does not achieve this for all \( n \).
