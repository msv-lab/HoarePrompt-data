Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program always prints the first two points as (1, 1) and (1, 2), and then prints subsequent points as (i, i) for i from 3 to n. This approach does not guarantee the maximum size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\).

For example, consider \(n = 3\). The optimal arrangement, as shown in the problem description, includes the points (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1). However, the program would output:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
```
This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 0, 2\} = \{0, 2\}\), which has a size of 2. However, the optimal arrangement gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), which has a size of 3.

Therefore, the program does not always produce the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\), making it incorrect.
