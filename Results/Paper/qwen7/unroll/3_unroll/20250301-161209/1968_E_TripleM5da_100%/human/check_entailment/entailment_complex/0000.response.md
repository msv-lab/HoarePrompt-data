Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by generating a specific set of points for each test case. However, upon closer inspection, the program does not always generate the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances (\(\mathcal{H}\)) for all values of \(n\).

1. **For \(n = 2\):**
   - The program generates the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
   - The Manhattan distances are \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\) and \(|1-1| + |2-1| = 1\).
   - \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which is correct.

2. **For \(n = 3\):**
   - The program generates the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((3, 3)\).
   - The Manhattan distances include \(0, 1, 2, 3\).
   - \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is correct.

3. **For \(n = 4\):**
   - The program generates the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), and \((4, 4)\).
   - The Manhattan distances include \(0, 1, 2, 3, 4\).
   - \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\), which is correct.

4. **For \(n = 5\):**
   - The program generates the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), and \((5, 5)\).
   - The Manhattan distances include \(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\).
   - \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), which is correct.

5. **For \(n = 6\):**
   - The program generates the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), and \((6, 1)\).
   - The Manhattan distances do not cover all possible values up to \(n-1\). For example, the distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((6, 1)\) is \(5\), but other distances like \(6\) are missing.
   - \(\mathcal{H}\) does not necessarily contain all values from \(0\) to \(5\).

Given the above analysis, the program fails to generate the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for some values of \(n\). Therefore, the program is not always correct.

Correctness: **False**
