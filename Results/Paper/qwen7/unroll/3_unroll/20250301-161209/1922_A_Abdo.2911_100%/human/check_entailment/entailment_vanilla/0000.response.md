### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Template Validation Logic**:
   - For each character position `i` in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`:
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, then `c[i]` should not be equal to `a[i]` for the strings `a` and `b` to match the template and `c` to not match.
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, then `c[i]` can be either `a[i]` or `b[i]` (since `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, this condition is automatically satisfied).
3. **Flag Management**:
   - The flag `possible` is used to track whether a valid template can be found.
   - If `c[i]` does not meet the required condition, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop breaks early.
4. **Output**:
   - After processing all characters, if `possible` is `True`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Given the provided examples and the logic implemented, the function appears to correctly determine whether a template exists that satisfies the given conditions.
