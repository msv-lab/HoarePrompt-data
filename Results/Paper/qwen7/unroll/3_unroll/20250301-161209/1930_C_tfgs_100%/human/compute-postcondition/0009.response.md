Output State: **`cur` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each unique element in the list `a` before sorting, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n - len(a)` to the variable `cnt`. The lengths and values of `cur`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `counter` remain unchanged.
