Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cur` is 0.
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `ans` is a list containing elements derived from the differences between consecutive elements in the list `a` up to `n` elements in total, with each element decremented by the number of iterations in the loop.
   - `counter` is a `Counter` object with decremented counts of each element in `a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `ans` is a list where each element is derived from the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, and each element is further decremented by the number of iterations in the loop.

To determine the exact values in `ans`, we need more information about the list `a` and the value of `n`. However, since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not provided, we can describe the general form of the elements in `ans`.

Given that `ans` is derived from the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and each element is decremented by the number of iterations in the loop, let's assume the following:
- If `a = [a1, a2, a3, ..., an]`, then the differences would be `[a2 - a1, a3 - a2, ..., an - an-1]`.
- Each difference is then decremented by the number of iterations in the loop, which is `cnt`.

Since `cnt` starts at 0 and increments with each iteration, the decrementing effect will vary depending on the length of the list and the number of iterations.

Therefore, the output will be a list of numbers, each representing the differences between consecutive elements in `a` decremented by the number of iterations in the loop.

Output: **[difference1 - cnt, difference2 - cnt, ..., differencen - cnt]** (where `differencei` is `ai+1 - ai` and `cnt` is the number of iterations in the loop)
