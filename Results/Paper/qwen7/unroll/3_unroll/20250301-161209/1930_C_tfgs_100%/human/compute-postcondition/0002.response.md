Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 in the `range(n)` function.
   - `n` is given as an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` (which is 0) is always less than `n` given the constraints on `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0 and will increment within the loop, the only variable that needs adjustment is `n`.
   - `t` is not involved in the loop condition and its value does not affect the loop execution directly.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n`, ensuring that it is within the valid range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `i` is 0**
