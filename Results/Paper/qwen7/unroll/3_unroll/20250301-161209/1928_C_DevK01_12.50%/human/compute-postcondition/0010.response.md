Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`, where `q` represents Vasya's position in the line and `x` represents the number Vasya received during the settling. It returns a list `M` containing integers `i` and `q//i` for each `i` in the range from 1 to the integer part of the square root of `q`, such that either `i` or `q//i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
