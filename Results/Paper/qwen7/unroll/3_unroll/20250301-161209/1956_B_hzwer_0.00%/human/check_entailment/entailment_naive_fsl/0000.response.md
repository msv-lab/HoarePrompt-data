Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly simulate the game as described. Specifically, the dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` does not accurately model the optimal strategy for Nene. The function assumes that Nene will always choose the move that maximizes her score while minimizing yours, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where Nene might choose a move that indirectly benefits you.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```
- Expected Output:
```
1
```
- Actual Output:
```
2
```

In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the maximum points you can get. Hereâ€™s how the game might proceed if both players play optimally:
1. You pick a card with 1, and Nene picks a card with 3.
2. You pick a card with 1, and Nene picks a card with 2.

In this scenario, you would score 1 point, and Nene would score 2 points. However, the program incorrectly calculates that you can score 2 points.

The issue lies in the dynamic programming transition where the program does not correctly account for the fact that Nene will always make the best possible move to maximize her score while minimizing yours. This leads to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
