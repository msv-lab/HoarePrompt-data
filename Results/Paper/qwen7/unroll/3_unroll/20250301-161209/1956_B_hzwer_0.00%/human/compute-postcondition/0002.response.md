Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and `cards` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces; `dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a 2D list `dp` with dimensions `(n+1) x (n+1)` and fills it with zeros. The variables `t` and `n` retain their initial states, and `cards` remains unchanged.
