Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, this constraint remains valid after the code execution. The other variables (`x`) are not mentioned in the initial state and are not affected by the code, so they are not included in the output state.
