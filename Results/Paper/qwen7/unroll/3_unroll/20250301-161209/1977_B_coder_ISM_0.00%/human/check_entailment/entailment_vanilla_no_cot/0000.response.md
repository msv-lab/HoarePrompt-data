Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly generating the required array `a` for each test case:

1. **Bitwise Representation**: The initial approach to generate the array `s` using bitwise operations is correct but doesn't ensure the constraints specified in the problem statement. Specifically, the generated array might contain consecutive non-zero elements, which violates the condition that there should not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_i \neq 0\) and \(a_{i+1} \neq 0\).

2. **Modification Logic**: The logic used to modify the array `s` to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements is flawed. For example, the code attempts to change elements to `-1` and `0` based on certain conditions, but this does not guarantee the desired property.

3. **Length Calculation**: The length of the array `s` is fixed at 30, which is not flexible enough to accommodate the constraint \(1 \le n \le 32\). The code also incorrectly appends elements without properly adjusting the length.

### Correct Approach:
A more straightforward and correct approach would be to use a greedy algorithm to construct the array while ensuring the constraints are met. Hereâ€™s a revised version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        length = 0
        
        # Construct the array in reverse order
        for i in range(30, -1, -1):
            if x & (1 << i):
                if len(s) > 0 and s[-1] != 0:
                    s[-1] = 0  # Change the last non-zero element to 0
                    s.append(-1)  # Add -1
                else:
                    s.append(1)  # Add 1
            else:
                s.append(0)  # Add 0
            length += 1
        
        # Ensure the length is between 1 and 32
        while length > 32:
            s.pop()
            length -= 1
        
        # Ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if s[i] != 0 and s[i + 1] != 0:
                s[i] = 0
                s[i + 1] = -1
        
        print(length)
        print(" ".join(map(str, s)))
```

This revised function constructs the array in reverse order, ensuring that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist and that the length is within the specified range.
