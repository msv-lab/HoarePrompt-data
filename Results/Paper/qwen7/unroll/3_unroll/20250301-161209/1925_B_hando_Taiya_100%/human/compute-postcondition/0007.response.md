Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( x \), and \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the maximum value between any divisor \( i \) of \( x \) and \( x // i \) where \( n \) is less than or equal to either \( i \) or \( x // i \). The function then prints this maximum value for each test case.**
