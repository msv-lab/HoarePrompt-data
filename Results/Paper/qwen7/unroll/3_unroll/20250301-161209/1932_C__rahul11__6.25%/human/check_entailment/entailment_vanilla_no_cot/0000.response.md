Correctness: **False**

The program has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Initialization of `ans`:** The variable `ans` should be initialized to 1 before the loop that multiplies the elements of the array.
2. **Handling of `MOD`:** The `MOD` value used in the program is `10 ** 9 + 6`, which is not required according to the problem statement. It should be `m`.
3. **Incorrect Calculation of Remainder:** The program calculates `ans % m % MOD` for the first result, but it should only calculate `ans % m`. Also, the `MOD` operation is unnecessary for subsequent calculations since `ans` is already taken modulo `m`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res[0] = ans
        c = 1
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[l], -1, m)) % m
                res[c] = ans
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[r], -1, m)) % m
                res[c] = ans
                r -= 1
            c += 1
        print(*res)

func()
```

Explanation of changes:
1. Initialize `ans` to 1 before the loop that multiplies the elements of the array.
2. Remove the unnecessary `MOD` operation.
3. Use modular inverse (`pow(arr[i], -1, m)`) to correctly handle division in modular arithmetic.
