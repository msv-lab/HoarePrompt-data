Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; the array `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; the string `s` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `MOD` is 10; the array `res` is a list of n integers calculated based on the operations inside the loop; `ans` is an integer initialized to 1 and updated during the loop.
