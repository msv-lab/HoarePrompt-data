Output State: t test cases are processed, and for each test case, the output is a sequence of numbers printed based on the given rules. Specifically, for each test case with n elements and starting with 1, the output sequence alternates between moving forward and backward through the array, starting with the first element, then the last, then the second, and so on, until all elements are visited. The exact sequence depends on the values of n and k but follows the described pattern.
