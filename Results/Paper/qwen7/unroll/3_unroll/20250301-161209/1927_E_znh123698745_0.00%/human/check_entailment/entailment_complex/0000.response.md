Reasoning:
1. The problem requires generating a k-level permutation of length n.
2. A k-level permutation ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length k is at most 1.
3. The provided solution generates a sequence by alternating between moving forward and backward through the array of numbers from 1 to n, starting with 1.
4. Let's analyze the correctness of the solution:
   - For each test case, the solution initializes `array` with the sequence `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
   - It then constructs the `answer` list by alternating between the start and end of the `array`, ensuring a balanced distribution of smaller and larger numbers.
   - The approach guarantees that the sequence will have a small variation in the sums of any continuous segment of length k due to the alternating pattern.
5. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach should produce a valid k-level permutation for any valid input \(n\) and \(k\).

Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly generates a k-level permutation for each test case based on the specified rules and constraints.
