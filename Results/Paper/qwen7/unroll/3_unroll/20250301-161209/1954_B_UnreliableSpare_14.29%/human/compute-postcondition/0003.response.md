Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be initialized to 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Consider the given initial state**:
   - `flag` is `True`.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, we need to ensure `i` is set to 1.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`flag` is True, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of n integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
