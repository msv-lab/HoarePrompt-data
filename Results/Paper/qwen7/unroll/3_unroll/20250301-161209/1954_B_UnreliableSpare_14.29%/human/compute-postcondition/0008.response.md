State: **`flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of n integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 in the `range(n)` function.
2. The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.
4. The other variables (`flag`, `t`, `arr`, `val`, `cnt`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` set to 0 and `n` set to a value greater than 0.
