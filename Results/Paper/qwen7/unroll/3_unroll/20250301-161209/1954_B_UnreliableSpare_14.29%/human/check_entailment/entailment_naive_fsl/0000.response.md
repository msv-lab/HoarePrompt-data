Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to account for arrays where removing elements is necessary to break the beauty condition. Hereâ€™s an example to illustrate this:

Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

According to the problem description, the goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. However, the current implementation checks if the array is already non-beautiful by seeing if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements that are different. If such a pair exists, it calculates the minimum number of removals needed. Otherwise, it outputs -1.

In the given example, the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` is beautiful because `a_2 = a_4` and `a_3 = a_5`. The program incorrectly identifies this array as not needing any removals to stop being beautiful, which is not correct according to the problem statement. The correct output should be `1`, as removing the element at index 2 (or 3) would make the array non-beautiful.

To fix this, the program needs to properly implement the logic to find the minimum number of removals required to break the beauty condition, rather than just checking if the array is already non-beautiful.
