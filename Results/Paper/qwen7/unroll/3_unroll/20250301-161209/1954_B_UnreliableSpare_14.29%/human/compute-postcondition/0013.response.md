Based on the initial state provided:

- `flag` is `True`.
- `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
- `val` is the first element of `arr`.
- `cnt` is the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`.
- `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.

The `print(-1)` statement simply outputs the integer `-1`. Since no other variables or their values are being printed, the output is solely `-1`.

Output: **-1**
