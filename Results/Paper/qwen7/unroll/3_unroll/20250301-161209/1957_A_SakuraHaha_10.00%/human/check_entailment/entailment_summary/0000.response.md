Reasoning:
1. The program is designed to process multiple test cases, which aligns with the problem statement.
2. For each test case, the program correctly reads the number of sticks (`n`) and their lengths.
3. It uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each stick length.
4. The program then calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed by dividing the count of each stick length by 4 (since each polygon needs 4 sides).
5. The program prints the result for each test case.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles multiple test cases, counts the occurrences of each stick length, and computes the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.

Correctness: **True**
