Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in a:`. The variables involved here are `x` and `a`.

2. **Understand the role of these variables**:
   - `x` is the variable that takes on each value from the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `a` is the list of integers.

3. **Determine the initial state of `a`**:
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - Since `a` is a list, its state is determined by the elements it contains.

4. **Determine the initial state of `x`**:
   - `x` is initialized to the first element of `a` when the loop starts.

5. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `a` is not empty. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `a` is not empty for the loop to execute.
   - We also need to set `x` to the first element of `a` for the first iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `a` must contain at least one element.
- `x` should be set to the first element of `a`.

Since `ans`, `t`, `n`, and `cnt` are not directly involved in the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` must contain at least one element, `x` is the first element of `a`**
