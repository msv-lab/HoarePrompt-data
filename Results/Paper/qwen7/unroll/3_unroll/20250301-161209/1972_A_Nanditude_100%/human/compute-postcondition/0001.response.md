Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is a placeholder for the loop index) and `t`. The loop will iterate `t` times.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: According to the problem statement, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.

3. **Check if the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer input and it is guaranteed to be between 1 and 100, it will always be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the State**: The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `t`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a valid value within its range.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that `t` is a valid integer between 1 and 100.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive**
