Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the constraints for the extroverts and universals.
2. The logic for determining the minimum number of tents is mostly correct, but there are some issues:
   - The condition `if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:` is overly restrictive. It should check if there are remaining extroverts that cannot form a group of three, regardless of the number of universals.
   - The calculation of `k` might not account for all possible scenarios where tents can be shared optimally among the universals.
3. Let's analyze the example test cases provided in the execution summary:
   - For the first test case (1 2 3), the program correctly calculates that 3 tents are needed.
   - For the second test case (1 4 1), the program incorrectly prints -1, which is incorrect because 2 tents can be used (1 tent for the introvert and 1 tent for 3 extroverts).
   - For the third test case (1 4 2), the program again incorrectly prints -1, which is also incorrect because 3 tents can be used (1 tent for the introvert and 2 tents for 6 extroverts).

Given these observations, the program does not handle all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**
