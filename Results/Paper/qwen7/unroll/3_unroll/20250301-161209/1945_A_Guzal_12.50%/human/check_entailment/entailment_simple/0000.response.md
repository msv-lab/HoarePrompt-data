Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
3. The logic inside the loop checks if it's possible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences:
   - If the number of extroverts (`b`) is not divisible by 3 and there are fewer than 3 universals (`c`), it prints `-1` because it's impossible to form groups of 3 for the extroverts.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of tents required:
     - `a + (b + c) // 3` accounts for the tents needed for introverts and full groups of 3 people (extroverts and universals).
     - If `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, it means there are leftover people who cannot form a complete group of 3, so an additional tent is needed for these people.
4. The program correctly handles all the conditions and prints the result for each test case.

Given the logic and the provided example, the program appears to be correct in its approach to solving the problem.
