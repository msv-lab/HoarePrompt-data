Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; and a parameter `a`, which is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n, representing the trace of the string. The function returns a specific output based on the given conditions.**
