Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and `ans` is a list of n elements, each element being 10^9; i is n - 2.**

The code `i = n - 2` assigns the value of `n - 2` to the variable `i`. Since `n` is between 2 and 500, `i` will be a value between 0 and 498. However, the values of `arr` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state.
