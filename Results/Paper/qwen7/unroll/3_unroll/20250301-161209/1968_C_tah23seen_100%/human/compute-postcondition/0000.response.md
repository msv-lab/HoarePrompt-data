Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and `ans` is a list of n elements, each element being 10^9.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` as a list of `n` elements, each set to the value `10 ** 9`. The initial state of `arr` remains unchanged, as no operation was performed on `arr`.
