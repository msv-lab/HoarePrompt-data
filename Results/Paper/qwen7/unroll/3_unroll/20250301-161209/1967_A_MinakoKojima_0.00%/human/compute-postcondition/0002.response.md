Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}. The list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}, representing the number of cards of type i after processing the loop. The value of ans is the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the list a, or the factorial of n if k is greater than or equal to n times the minimum element in a.
