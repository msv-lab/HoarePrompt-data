Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a variable `t` (an integer between 1 and 1000) and a string `s` (consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks with a length between 1 and 5000) for each testcase. It returns a specific value based on the conditions defined for `t` and the content of `s`.**
