Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is evident from the loop `for i in range(t):`.

2. **String Processing**: In the function `func_1()`, the string `s` is converted to a list, which is necessary for modifying elements directly. The program then iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats in descending order (`for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1)`).

3. **Tandem Repeat Check**: For each possible length `j`, the program checks if there exists a tandem repeat by comparing characters and handling question marks appropriately. Specifically, if either character at positions `k` and `k + j` is a question mark (`'?'`) or they are equal, the count is incremented. If the count reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2*j` has been found, and this length is printed.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: If no tandem repeat is found for any length, the program correctly prints `0`.

5. **Output**: The program outputs the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring for each test case, which matches the problem requirements.

Given the above points, the provided program logic appears to be correct for solving the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
