Output State: The output state will be the value printed inside the loop if there exists a pair of indices (k, k+j) in the list `s` such that `s[k] == s[k + j]` or `s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?',` and the count of such pairs equals `j`. If no such pair is found for any `j`, the output state will be nothing (i.e., no output).
