Reasoning:
1. The program aims to find the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring after replacing each question mark with a lowercase Latin letter.
2. The function `func_1()` iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats starting from half the length of the string down to 1.
3. For each possible length `j`, it checks all possible pairs `(k, k+j)` in the string.
4. If both characters in a pair are either equal or one of them is a question mark, it increments a counter `count`.
5. If `count` equals `j`, it means a valid tandem repeat of length `2*j` can be formed, and the function prints `2*j` and returns immediately.
6. If no valid tandem repeat is found for any length, it prints `0`.

Given the logic, the function correctly checks for the possibility of forming tandem repeats and prints the maximum possible length. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic:

- The function should attempt to replace question marks with lowercase Latin letters to maximize the tandem repeat length before checking the condition.
- The current implementation does not actually replace the question marks; it only checks the existing string for tandem repeats.

To fix this, the program needs to generate all possible strings by replacing question marks with different lowercase letters and then check each generated string for the maximum tandem repeat length.

Since the current implementation does not replace question marks and directly checks the input string, it cannot achieve the goal of maximizing the tandem repeat length.

Correctness: **False**
