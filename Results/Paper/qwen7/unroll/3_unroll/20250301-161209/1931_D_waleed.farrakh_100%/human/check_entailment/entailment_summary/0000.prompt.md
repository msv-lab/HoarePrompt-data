Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

# Functions with Execution Summary:

Function number 1 :

        freq = {}

        results.append(count)
    return results
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the size of an array, two integers representing Polycarp's favorite numbers, and the array itself. For each tuple, it calculates the number of pairs (a, b) in the array such that \(a \mod x\) equals \((-b \mod x + x) \mod x\) and \(a \mod y\) equals \(b \mod y\). It then returns a list of these counts for each test case.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    t = int(data[0])
    test_cases = []
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, data[idx].split())
        arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))
        test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
        idx += 2
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \), followed by \( t \) sets of inputs. Each set includes integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), and a list \( arr \) of \( n \) integers. It calls another function `func_1` with the collected test cases and prints the results returned by `func_1`. The final state of the program includes the console output of the results for all test cases.
