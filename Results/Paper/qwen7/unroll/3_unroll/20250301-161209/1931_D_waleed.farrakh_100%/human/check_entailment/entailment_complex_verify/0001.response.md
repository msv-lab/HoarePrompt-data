### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list.
   - For each test case, `freq` (a dictionary to store frequency of remainders) and `count` (to store the number of beautiful pairs) are initialized.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, compute the remainders when `a` is divided by `x` and `y`.
   - Compute `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` to ensure `rx` is non-negative.
   - Compute `ry = a % y`.
   - Check if `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`. If it does, add the count from `freq[rx, ry]` to `count`.
   - Update the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

3. **Return the results**:
   - Append the final `count` to `results` and return `results`.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - Split the input into lines.
   - Parse the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, parse `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - Append the parsed test case to `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - Call `func_1` with `test_cases` and store the results.
   - Print each result from `results`.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Remainder Calculation**:
   - The calculation `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is always non-negative. This is crucial because negative remainders would incorrectly match pairs.
   - The computation `a % y` directly gives the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.

2. **Pair Counting**:
   - The logic for counting pairs is correct. For each element `a`, we check if there are any previous elements that form a beautiful pair with `a`.
   - The use of remainders helps in efficiently finding pairs that satisfy the conditions.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The input handling in `func_2` is correct. It reads the entire input at once and processes it correctly.
   - The parsing of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` is done correctly, ensuring that the constraints are respected.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as large arrays and multiple test cases correctly. The use of dictionaries for frequency counting ensures efficient processing even for large inputs.

### Conclusion

After re-analyzing the program, it is clear that the logic for finding beautiful pairs is correct, and the input handling is also correct. The program should work as expected based on the problem description.
