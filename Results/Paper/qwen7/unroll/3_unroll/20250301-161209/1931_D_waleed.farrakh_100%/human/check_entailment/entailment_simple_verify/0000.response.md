### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its logic step-by-step to ensure it meets the requirements of the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `freq` is a dictionary used to store the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)` for each element `a` in the array.
   - `count` is initialized to 0 and will store the number of beautiful pairs.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - For each element `a` in the array, calculate `rx` and `ry` as follows:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`: This ensures that `rx` is always non-negative.
     - `ry = a % y`: This is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.

3. **Check and update the frequency**:
   - If the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`, increment `count` by the frequency of this pair.
   - Update the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

4. **Return the count**:
   - After processing all elements, append the count to the results list.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Read input**:
   - Read the entire input from stdin and split it into lines.
   - Extract the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, extract `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.

2. **Process each test case**:
   - Call `func_1` with the test case data.
   - Print the result for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The logic for calculating `rx` and `ry` is correct. It ensures that `rx` is always non-negative.
   - The use of the frequency dictionary to count pairs `(rx, ry)` is appropriate and ensures that all pairs meeting the criteria are counted.
   - The overall approach of iterating through the array and checking for pairs is correct.

2. **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - Reading the input and splitting it into lines is correct.
   - Processing each test case and calling `func_1` is correct.
   - Printing the results is also correct.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `6 5 2 1 2 7 4 9 6`
  - `func_1` will process the array `[1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]` and find the pairs:
    - Pair `<1, 5>`: `a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10` (divisible by 5) and `a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8` (divisible by 2).
    - Pair `<4, 6>`: `a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10` (divisible by 5) and `a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2` (divisible by 2).
  - Result: 2 beautiful pairs.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `7 9 5 1 10 15 3 8 12 15`
  - No pairs meet the criteria.
  - Result: 0 beautiful pairs.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `9 4 10 14 10 2 2 11 11 13 5 6`
  - Only one pair `<4, 6>`: `a_4 + a_6 = 2 + 2 = 4` (divisible by 4) and `a_4 - a_6 = 2 - 2 = 0` (divisible by 10).
  - Result: 1 beautiful pair.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. The annotations and the detailed analysis confirm that the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct.
