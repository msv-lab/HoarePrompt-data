### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program against the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the number of pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) in an array \(a\) such that:
  - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\)
  - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\)

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` iterates through the array and uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of the remainders of the elements when divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
- For each element \(a\), it calculates the required remainders:
  - \(r_x = (-a \% x + x) \% x\) which ensures \(r_x\) is non-negative.
  - \(r_y = a \% y\)
- It checks if these remainders exist in the frequency dictionary. If they do, it increments the count by the frequency of those remainders.
- This approach ensures that both conditions for a beautiful pair are met.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function `func_2` reads the input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- It then prints the results for each test case.

#### Function Summaries:
- The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases and calls `func_1` with the collected test cases.
- It prints the results returned by `func_1`.

#### Correctness Verification:
1. **Remainder Calculation**:
   - The calculation of remainders \(r_x\) and \(r_y\) is correct and ensures that the conditions are checked properly.
2. **Frequency Dictionary Usage**:
   - The use of a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of remainders is appropriate and ensures that the pairs meeting the conditions are counted correctly.
3. **Input Handling**:
   - The input handling in `func_2` is correct and processes the test cases as expected.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array according to the given problem description. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description, function summaries, and the provided examples.
