Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are not yet defined, `arr` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` assigns the function `sys.stdin.read` to the variable `input`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or `arr`. Therefore, the only change is that `input` now refers to the `sys.stdin.read` method. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain undefined until further input is provided.
