The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \), followed by \( t \) sets of inputs. Each set includes integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), and a list \( arr \) of \( n \) integers. It calls another function `func_1` with the collected test cases and prints the results returned by `func_1`. The final state of the program includes the console output of the results for all test cases.
