Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input along line breaks, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `n` is not yet defined, `x` is not yet defined, `y` is not yet defined, `arr` is not yet defined, `input` is not yet defined, `idx` is 1.**

The code simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `idx`. No other variables are affected, and the initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.
