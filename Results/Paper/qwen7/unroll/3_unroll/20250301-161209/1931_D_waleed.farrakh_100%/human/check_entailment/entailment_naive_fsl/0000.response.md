Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array according to the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function iterates through the array and uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of the remainders of the elements when divided by `x` and `y`. For each element, it calculates the required remainders and checks if these remainders exist in the frequency dictionary. If they do, it increments the count by the frequency of those remainders. This ensures that both conditions for a beautiful pair are met.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It then prints the results for each test case.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly identifies all pairs `(i, j)` such that:
- `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`
- `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`

Since the program handles all the described conditions and the provided examples work correctly, there are no identified cases where the program fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
