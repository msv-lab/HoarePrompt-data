Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input along line breaks, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are not yet defined, `arr` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**

The code `data = input().splitlines()` reads a single line of input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings based on line breaks. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) are not defined or affected by this operation.
