Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter t, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each test case, it accepts three integers n, x, and y, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9. Additionally, it accepts a list arr of n integers, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the given constraints and relationships.**

Note: The specific return value is not detailed in the provided information, so the focus is on the parameters accepted by the function.
