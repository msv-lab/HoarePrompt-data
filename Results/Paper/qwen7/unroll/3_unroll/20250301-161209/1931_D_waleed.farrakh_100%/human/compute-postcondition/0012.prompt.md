You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9. arr is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    t = int(data[0])
    test_cases = []
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))
        
        test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
        
        idx += 2
        
    #State: Output State: `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input along line breaks, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `test_cases` is a list containing tuples of integers where each tuple consists of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, `n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `input` is not yet defined, `idx` is equal to `t * 2 + 1`.
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: data is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input along line breaks, t is the first element of data converted to an integer, test_cases is a list containing tuples of integers where each tuple consists of n, x, y, and arr, results is the return value of func_1(test_cases), idx is equal to t * 2 + 1, the console has printed each result in the results list once.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter t, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each test case, it accepts three integers n, x, and y, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9. Additionally, it accepts a list arr of n integers, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the given constraints and relationships.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
