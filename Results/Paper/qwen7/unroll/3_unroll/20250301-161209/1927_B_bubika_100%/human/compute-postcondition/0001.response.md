Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for t in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the given state, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run as long as `int(input())` provides a value within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). 

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on the input value, the state must include the condition that the input value must be within the specified range for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that will be used in `int(input())` to determine the number of iterations of the loop.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- The input value must be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) for the loop to execute

So, the final state is:
**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the input value must be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
