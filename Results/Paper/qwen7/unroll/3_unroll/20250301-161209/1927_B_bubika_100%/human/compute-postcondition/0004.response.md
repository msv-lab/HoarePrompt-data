Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined by three inputs: a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i < n). It returns information based on these inputs.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return value are not described here as per the given instruction.
