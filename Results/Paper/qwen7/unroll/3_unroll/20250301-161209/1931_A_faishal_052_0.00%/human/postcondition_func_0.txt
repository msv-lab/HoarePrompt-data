The function processes a series of test cases, where for each case, it reads an integer `lex` and transforms it based on certain conditions. Specifically, if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it replaces `lex` with 1; otherwise, it replaces `lex` with 26. After processing, it sorts the transformed values and prints the first three characters corresponding to these values, converted to lowercase letters. The function does not return any value but outputs the processed characters for each test case.
