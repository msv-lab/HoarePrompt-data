You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())
        
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        
        arr.append(lex)
        
        arr.sort()
        
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of characters printed for each iteration of the outer loop. For each iteration, three characters will be printed based on the value of `lex` after processing through the inner loops. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it will be replaced by 1, otherwise, it will be replaced by 26, and then sorted before converting to characters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`. The exact characters depend on the initial value of `lex` for each case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes two values, `t` and `n`, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `n` is an integer between 3 and 78. The function does not return any value explicitly but implies that it should handle these constraints and possibly perform some operations based on these values.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
