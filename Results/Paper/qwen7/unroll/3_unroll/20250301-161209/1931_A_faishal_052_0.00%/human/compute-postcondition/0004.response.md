Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two values, `t` and `n`, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `n` is an integer between 3 and 78. The function does not return any value explicitly but implies that it should handle these constraints and possibly perform some operations based on these values.**

However, since the function definition itself does not accept any parameters, the description should reflect that the parameters are part of the problem constraints rather than function inputs.
