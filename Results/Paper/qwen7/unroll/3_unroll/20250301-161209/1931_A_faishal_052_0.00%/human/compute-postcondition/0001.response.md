State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(cases):` will execute as long as `cases` is greater than 0.
2. The variable `i` starts from 0 in the `range` function, so before the first iteration, `i` should be set to 1.
3. Since `cases` is an input integer and must be such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, we only need to ensure that `cases` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
4. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should be: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**.
