### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Filling `arr`:**
   - The program tries to fill `arr` with values based on the conditions `lex <= 26` and `lex < 52`, but these conditions do not correctly represent the possible values for the letters in the word. For example, if `lex` is 24, the program will incorrectly set the first two elements of `arr` to 1 (for 'a'), and the third element to 24, which is incorrect because it should be 22 (for 'v').

2. **Sorting and Printing:**
   - The program sorts the elements of `arr` and prints the corresponding characters. However, since the sorting and filling logic are flawed, the output is not correct. For instance, for `lex = 24`, the program might output something like "aaa" instead of "aav".

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the input `lex = 24`. The correct lexicographically smallest word is "aav". However, the program will incorrectly handle this case. Here's a detailed breakdown:
     - If `lex = 24`, the program will:
       - Set the first two elements of `arr` to 1 (for 'a').
       - Set the third element to 24.
       - Sort `arr` to get `[1, 1, 24]`.
       - Print the characters corresponding to these values, which are "aaa" (incorrect).

4. **Other Test Cases:**
   - For `lex = 70`, the correct answer is "rzz". The program will incorrectly handle this case as well. For example, it might output "zzz" instead of "rzz".

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for all test cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect and does not produce the correct output for all test cases.
