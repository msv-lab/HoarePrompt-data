Output State: The output state will consist of a series of characters printed for each iteration of the outer loop. For each iteration, three characters will be printed based on the value of `lex` after processing through the inner loops. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it will be replaced by 1, otherwise, it will be replaced by 26, and then sorted before converting to characters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`. The exact characters depend on the initial value of `lex` for each case.
