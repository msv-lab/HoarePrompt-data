You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of characters printed for each iteration of the outer loop. For each iteration, three characters will be printed based on the value of `lex` after processing through the inner loops. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it will be replaced by 1, otherwise, it will be replaced by 26, and then sorted before converting to characters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`. The exact characters depend on the initial value of `lex` for each case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded for all potential cases. Specifically, the program logic is flawed in how it constructs the word based on the encoded value.

For instance, consider the input `lex = 24`. The correct lexicographically smallest word that encodes to 24 is "aav". However, the program will incorrectly handle this case. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The program initializes an empty list `arr` and reads the encoded value `lex`.
2. It then attempts to fill `arr` with values based on the encoded value, but the logic for determining these values is incorrect. For example, it assumes that the first two letters are either 'a' or 'z', which is not always true.
3. The final step sorts `arr` and prints the characters corresponding to the sorted values.

Let's take the example of `lex = 24`:
- The correct approach would be to start with 'a' (1), 'a' (1), and 'v' (22), resulting in "aav".
- However, the program's logic does not correctly account for the distribution of the remaining value after assigning the first two 'a's.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly distribute the remaining value among the three letters while ensuring the word remains lexicographically smallest. The current implementation fails to do this accurately for many cases, leading to incorrect results.
