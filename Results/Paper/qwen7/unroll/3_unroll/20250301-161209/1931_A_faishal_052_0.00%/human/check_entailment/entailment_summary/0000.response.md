Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that could have been encoded to a given integer.
2. The given program attempts to decode the integer back into a word by setting specific conditions:
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it sets the character to 'a' (index 1).
   - Otherwise, it sets the character to 'z' (index 26).
3. However, the logic in the program is flawed:
   - It incorrectly handles the transformation of `lex` to the corresponding character indices.
   - It does not correctly account for the sum of character positions.
   - It does not ensure the smallest possible word is generated.
4. The execution summary indicates that the program sorts the transformed values and prints the first three characters, which is not the correct approach for decoding the sum of character positions.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
