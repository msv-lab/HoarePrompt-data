Output State: The output state depends on the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` for each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if the conditions in the loop body are met, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The final output state is a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the evaluations of the conditions for each iteration.
