Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The program checks the conditions for `x` relative to `k - 1`:
     - If `x < k - 1`:
       - It checks if `a >= x + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
     - If `x == k - 1`:
       - It checks if `a >= x + 3`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
     - Otherwise (`x > k - 1`):
       - It calculates `z` as the sum of the series where each term is incremented by 1 after being divided by `(k - 1)` up to `x + 1` terms.
       - It checks if `a >= z`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

3. **Calculation of `z`:**
   - The calculation of `z` seems to be an attempt to determine the minimum number of coins required to ensure that Sasha can keep winning even if he loses up to `x` times in a row.
   - However, the logic for calculating `z` might be flawed because the series sum calculation does not directly translate to the required condition for Sasha to win any number of coins.

### Detailed Explanation

- **Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \)**
  - If Sasha can lose up to `x` times in a row, and `x < k - 1`, then Sasha can always win the next bet after losing up to `x` times. This is because the gain from a win (which is `y \cdot k`) is greater than the loss from a single bet (which is `y`). Hence, if Sasha starts with enough coins to cover the worst-case scenario of losing up to `x` times, he can always recover and win back more coins.
  - The condition `a >= x + 1` is correct because Sasha needs at least `x + 1` coins to cover the worst-case scenario of losing up to `x` times and still have at least one coin to win back.

- **Case 2: \( x == k - 1 \)**
  - If Sasha can lose exactly `k - 1` times in a row, then Sasha needs to have enough coins to cover the worst-case scenario of losing `k - 1` times and still have at least 3 coins left to win back.
  - The condition `a >= x + 3` is correct because Sasha needs at least `x + 3` coins to cover the worst-case scenario of losing `k - 1` times and still have at least 3 coins to win back.

- **Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \)**
  - If Sasha can lose more than `k - 1` times in a row, the logic for calculating `z` is incorrect. The series sum calculation does not accurately represent the required condition.
  - The correct approach would be to check if Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario of losing up to `x` times and still have enough coins to win back. This requires a different calculation or a different approach.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program is correct for the cases where `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1`. However, the logic for the case where `x > k - 1` is incorrect. Therefore, the overall program is not fully correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
