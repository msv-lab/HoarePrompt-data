Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.
3. The logic inside the loop checks different conditions based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`:
   - If `x < k - 1`, it checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. This condition ensures that Sasha can always win enough coins to exceed `n` coins.
   - If `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`. This condition is derived from the fact that Sasha needs to win at least twice in a row after losing once to ensure he can accumulate enough coins.
   - If `x > k - 1`, it calculates the minimum number of coins required to ensure Sasha can win enough coins to exceed `n` coins using a geometric progression approach. The variable `z` is calculated as the sum of a series where each term is the result of dividing the previous term by `(k - 1)` and adding 1. This calculation ensures that Sasha can always win enough coins to exceed `n` coins given the constraints.
4. The program prints 'YES' if Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins and 'NO' otherwise.
5. The logic appears to cover all possible scenarios based on the problem statement and examples provided.

Given the analysis, the program logic matches the requirements of the problem and handles all edge cases appropriately.
