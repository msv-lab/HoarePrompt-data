You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

    4 88 1000000000
    
    25 69 231
    
    13 97 18806

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 3:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = 0
            for i in range(x + 1):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of inputs, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \). For each input, it checks specific conditions involving these integers and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether those conditions are satisfied. After processing all inputs, it outputs a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' values corresponding to each input's evaluation.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The program checks the conditions for `x` relative to `k - 1`:
     - If `x < k - 1`:
       - It checks if `a >= x + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
     - If `x == k - 1`:
       - It checks if `a >= x + 3`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
     - Otherwise (`x > k - 1`):
       - It calculates `z` as the sum of the series where each term is incremented by 1 after being divided by `(k - 1)` up to `x + 1` terms.
       - It checks if `a >= z`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

3. **Calculation of `z`:**
   - The calculation of `z` seems to be an attempt to determine the minimum number of coins required to ensure that Sasha can keep winning even if he loses up to `x` times in a row.
   - However, the logic for calculating `z` might be flawed because the series sum calculation does not directly translate to the required condition for Sasha to win any number of coins.

### Detailed Explanation

- **Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \)**
  - If Sasha can lose up to `x` times in a row, and `x < k - 1`, then Sasha can always win the next bet after losing up to `x` times. This is because the gain from a win (which is `y \cdot k`) is greater than the loss from a single bet (which is `y`). Hence, if Sasha starts with enough coins to cover the worst-case scenario of losing up to `x` times, he can always recover and win back more coins.
  - The condition `a >= x + 1` is correct because Sasha needs at least `x + 1` coins to cover the worst-case scenario of losing up to `x` times and still have at least one coin to win back.

- **Case 2: \( x == k - 1 \)**
  - If Sasha can lose exactly `k - 1` times in a row, then Sasha needs to have enough coins to cover the worst-case scenario of losing `k - 1` times and still have at least 3 coins left to win back.
  - The condition `a >= x + 3` is correct because Sasha needs at least `x + 3` coins to cover the worst-case scenario of losing `k - 1` times and still have at least 3 coins to win back.

- **Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \)**
  - If Sasha can lose more than `k - 1` times in a row, the logic for calculating `z` is incorrect. The series sum calculation does not accurately represent the required condition.
  - The correct approach would be to check if Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario of losing up to `x` times and still have enough coins to win back. This requires a different calculation or a different approach.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program is correct for the cases where `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1`. However, the logic for the case where `x > k - 1` is incorrect. Therefore, the overall program is not fully correct.
