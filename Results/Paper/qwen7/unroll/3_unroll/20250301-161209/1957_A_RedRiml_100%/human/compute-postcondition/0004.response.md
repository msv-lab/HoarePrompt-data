Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an unspecified number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). It returns information based on the given inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes a value `t`, another value `n`, and a list of `n` integers `a_i`. The function processes these inputs and provides a specific output for each test case, though the exact nature of the output is not specified in the given information.
