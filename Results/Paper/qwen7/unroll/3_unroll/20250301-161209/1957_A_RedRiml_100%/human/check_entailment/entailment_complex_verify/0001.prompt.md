You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the lengths of the sticks, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an integer representing the number of iterations of the loop, and after executing all iterations, `shapes` is an integer representing the total number of shapes calculated from the input data.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths. It then calculates the total number of shapes that can be formed using these sticks, where each shape requires three sticks of the same length. The function outputs the total number of such shapes for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `w` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` representing the number of sticks.
   - It then reads a list of stick lengths `palka`.

2. **Counting Stick Frequencies:**
   - A dictionary `d` is used to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - A list `pl` is used to store unique stick lengths.

3. **Calculating Maximum Polygons:**
   - The program iterates over the unique stick lengths in `pl`.
   - For each unique stick length `j`, it checks if there are at least 3 sticks of that length (`d[j] >= 3`).
   - If so, it adds the number of complete polygons that can be formed using those sticks (`d[j] // 3`) to the variable `shapes`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the total number of polygons for each test case.

### Checking Against Problem Description

- **Sticks and Polygons:** The program correctly counts the number of complete polygons that can be formed using the sticks. It ensures that no stick is reused by checking the frequency of each stick length and only counting complete sets of 3 or more sticks.
- **Test Cases:** The program processes multiple test cases as expected, reading the number of sticks, their lengths, and then calculating the maximum number of polygons.

### Edge Cases and Examples

1. **Single Stick (Example 1):**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - The program correctly outputs `0` because a single stick cannot form any polygon.

2. **Two Identical Sticks (Example 2):**
   - Input: `2 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - The program correctly outputs `0` because two sticks are insufficient to form any polygon.

3. **Multiple Sticks of Same Length (Example 3):**
   - Input: `6 2 2 3 3 3 3`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program correctly outputs `1` because four sticks of length 3 can form one square.

4. **Mixed Stick Lengths (Example 4):**
   - Input: `9 4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - The program correctly outputs `2` because two sets of sticks can form one pentagon (side length 2) and one square (side length 4).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks. It handles all edge cases and examples provided in the problem statement.
