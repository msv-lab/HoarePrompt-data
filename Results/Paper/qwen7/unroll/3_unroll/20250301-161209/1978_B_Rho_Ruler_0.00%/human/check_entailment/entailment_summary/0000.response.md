Reasoning:
1. The given program attempts to find the optimal value of \( k \) using binary search, which is not necessary for solving this problem.
2. The goal is to maximize profit, and the profit calculation is straightforward without needing binary search.
3. The function `func_1` incorrectly checks if the calculated profit (`ans`) is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which is not relevant to finding the maximum profit.
4. The correct approach would be to directly calculate the profit for all possible values of \( k \) from 0 to \( n \) and keep track of the maximum profit.

Given these points, the provided program is incorrect because it uses an unnecessary and inappropriate method (binary search) and has a flawed logic check in the helper function.

Correctness: **False**
