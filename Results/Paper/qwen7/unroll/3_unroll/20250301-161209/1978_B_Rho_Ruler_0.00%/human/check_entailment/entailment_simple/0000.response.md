Reasoning:
1. The given program aims to find the maximum profit Bob can obtain by choosing an optimal `k` for the promotion.
2. The binary search approach is used to find the best `k` within the range `[0, n]`.
3. The `func_1` function calculates the total profit for a given `k` and checks if it is within the constraints.
4. However, there is a logical error in the `func_1` function. The condition `return ans <= n * max(a, b)` should be `return ans >= n * max(a, b)` to ensure that the function returns `True` when the calculated profit is greater than or equal to the maximum possible profit.

Given the logical error in the `func_1` function, the program will not correctly determine the maximum profit.

Correctness: **False**
