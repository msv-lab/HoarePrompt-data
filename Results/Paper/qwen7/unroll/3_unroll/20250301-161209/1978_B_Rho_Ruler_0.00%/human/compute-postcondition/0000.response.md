Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `ans` is 0, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other changes are made to the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain as they were in the initial state, while `ans` is explicitly set to 0.
