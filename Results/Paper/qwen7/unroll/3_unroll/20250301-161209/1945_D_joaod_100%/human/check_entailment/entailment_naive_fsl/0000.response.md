Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the scenario where Kirill needs to pay both `a_i` and `b_i` costs to move to a new position.

Consider the following test case:

```
Input:
2
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
6 2
6 9 7 1 8 3
5 8 8 1 4 1
```

The program's output for the first test case is `14`, which is incorrect. The correct minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first 2 positions is `10`. Here's the breakdown:

- Initially, Kirill is at position 4.
- He can move to position 3 for a cost of `a_3 = 3`.
- From position 3, he can move to position 2 for a cost of `a_2 = 6`.
- Total cost: `3 + 6 = 9`.

However, the program calculates the cost incorrectly. It does not properly account for the cumulative cost of moving through intermediate positions. For instance, the program might incorrectly calculate the cost of moving directly from position 4 to position 1, which would involve paying `a_1` and `b_2`, leading to an incorrect total cost.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly accumulate the costs while ensuring that the final position is within the allowed limit. The current implementation does not handle this logic correctly, leading to incorrect results.
