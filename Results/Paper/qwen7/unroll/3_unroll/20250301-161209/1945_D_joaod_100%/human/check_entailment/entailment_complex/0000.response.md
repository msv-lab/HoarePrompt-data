Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`), and for each test case, it reads the number of people in front of Kirill (`na_frente`) and the maximum allowable final position (`pos_final`). This part is handled correctly.

2. **Cost Lists**: The program correctly reads and stores the costs for swapping (`custo_pra_trocar_a`) and passing (`custo_pra_passar_b`) into lists.

3. **Adjusting Indices**: The program correctly adjusts the indices for `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1, which is necessary because indexing in Python starts from 0.

4. **Dynamic Calculation**: The program iterates backward through the positions from `na_frente` to 0. It correctly calculates the minimum cost to reach `pos_final` by considering both swapping and passing costs. The logic inside the loop is sound and handles the conditions appropriately.

5. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is stored in the variable `best`.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. There are no apparent logical errors or misinterpretations of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
