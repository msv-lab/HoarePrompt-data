The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it calculates the minimum cost to move from position `na_frente` to position `pos_final` using either swapping or passing, based on given costs. The function updates a variable `best` to store the minimum cost for each case and prints the result for each case. After processing all cases, the function does not return any value but ensures that the minimum cost is printed for each test case.
