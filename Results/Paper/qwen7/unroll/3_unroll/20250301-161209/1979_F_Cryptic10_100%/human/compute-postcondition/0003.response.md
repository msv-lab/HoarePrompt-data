Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers, t and n, where t is an integer between 1 and 1000, and n is an integer between 2 and 10^5. The function ensures that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. Based on these inputs, the function returns a specific output for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by a pair of integers (t, n) within specified ranges, and it processes these inputs without needing them as explicit function parameters.
