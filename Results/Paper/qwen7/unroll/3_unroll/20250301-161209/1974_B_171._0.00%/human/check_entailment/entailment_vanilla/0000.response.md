Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num_cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string.
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `mapping` to store the reverse mapping of characters.
   - It also initializes an empty list `decoded` to store the decoded characters.

3. **Mapping Characters:**
   - For each character in the encoded string:
     - If the character is already in the `mapping`, it appends the corresponding mapped character to `decoded`.
     - If the character is not in the `mapping`, it tries to find the next available character in the alphabet that hasn't been used yet.
       - It iterates through the alphabet from 'a' to 'z'.
       - When it finds a character that is not already in the values of `mapping`, it maps this character to the current encoded character and appends the mapped character to `decoded`.

4. **Returning the Decoded String:**
   - Finally, it joins the list `decoded` into a string and returns it.

### Issues in the Given Program

1. **Incorrect Mapping Logic:**
   - The logic for finding the next available character in the alphabet is flawed. It should map the characters in such a way that the first character of the encoded string maps to the last character of the unique characters string `r`, the second character of the encoded string maps to the second last character of `r`, and so on.
   - The current implementation simply assigns the next available character in the alphabet without considering the structure of `r`.

2. **Incorrect Decoding Process:**
   - The program does not correctly reverse the encoding process. Instead of mapping the characters based on their positions in `r`, it maps them based on the next available character in the alphabet.

### Correct Approach

To correctly decode the string, we need to follow these steps:

1. Construct the string `r` from the unique characters of the encoded string in sorted order.
2. Create a reverse mapping from `r` to the original characters.
3. Use this reverse mapping to decode the encoded string.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        
        # Step 1: Construct the string r
        unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
        r = ''.join(unique_chars)
        
        # Step 2: Create the reverse mapping
        mapping = {char: r[-i-1] for i, char in enumerate(unique_chars)}
        
        # Step 3: Decode the string
        decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
        
        print(decoded)
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the decoding process. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
