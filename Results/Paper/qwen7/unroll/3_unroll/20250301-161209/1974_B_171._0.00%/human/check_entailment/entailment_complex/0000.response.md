Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` aims to decode the `encoded` string back to the original string `s`.
2. The function creates a mapping from each character in the alphabet ('a' to 'z') to a character in the `encoded` string.
3. For each character in the `encoded` string, it checks if there is an existing mapping. If there is, it appends the mapped character to the `decoded` list. If not, it finds the next available character in the alphabet that hasn't been used yet and maps it to the current character in the `encoded` string.
4. After processing all characters in the `encoded` string, it constructs the `decoded` string by joining the characters in the `decoded` list.
5. The logic correctly handles the encoding algorithm's reverse process, ensuring that each character in the `encoded` string is mapped back to its original character in the `s` string.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
