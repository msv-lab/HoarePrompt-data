#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of encoded is at most 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s using the specified algorithm.
def func_1(encoded):
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break
            decoded.append(chr(c))
        
    #State: Output State: `mapping` is a dictionary where each key from 'a' to 'z' maps to a unique character from the `encoded` string, and `decoded` is a list containing each character from `encoded` in the order they appear.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string that is formed by concatenating all characters in the `decoded` list in the order they appear.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `encoded` which is the result of encoding some original string using a specific algorithm. It then decodes the `encoded` string by mapping each character back to its original form and constructs a new string `decoded`. Finally, it returns this decoded string.
