Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem:

1. **Triangle Inequality Check**: The solution does not check if the selected three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. According to the triangle inequality theorem, for three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. This check is missing in the current implementation.

2. **Counting Valid Triangles**: The code calculates combinations of sticks without ensuring they satisfy the triangle inequality. For example, if the sticks are of lengths \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3\), the combination \((2^1, 2^2, 2^3)\) should not be counted because \(2^1 + 2^2 \leq 2^3\).

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Combinations**: The current logic for counting combinations does not account for the triangle inequality condition. It simply counts all possible combinations of three sticks regardless of whether they can form a triangle.

To fix these issues, you need to modify the code to include the triangle inequality check. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    buffer = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
        if n < 3:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        q = [0 for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(eta)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(eta)):
                for k in range(j + 1, len(eta)):
                    if eta[i] + eta[j] > eta[k] and eta[i] + eta[k] > eta[j] and eta[j] + eta[k] > eta[i]:
                        count += q[eta[i]] * q[eta[j]] * q[eta[k]]
        
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that only valid triangles (satisfying the triangle inequality) are counted.
