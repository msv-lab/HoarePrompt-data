Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `t`.
   - `i` is the loop counter.
   - `t` is the upper limit of the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because the `range(t)` function will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`. Since `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we know `t` must be at least 1.
   - The value of `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `t-1`.

3. **Consider the Given State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `buffer` is an empty list.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `i` should be 0 since the loop starts with `i = 0`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:
- `t` must be at least 1 (since \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), this condition is already satisfied).
- `i` should be 0.

So, the final state is:
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list.**

However, since the only variable that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is `i`, the simplified answer is:
**`i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list.**

But to fully capture the requirement, we include `t` as well:
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list.**
