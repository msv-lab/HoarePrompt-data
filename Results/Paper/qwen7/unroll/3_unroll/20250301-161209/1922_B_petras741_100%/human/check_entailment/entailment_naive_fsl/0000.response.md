Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The logic in the program does not account for the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
2 3 3 4
```

The program will output `12`, but the correct output should be `4`. Here are the valid combinations:
- (2, 3, 3)
- (2, 3, 4)
- (3, 3, 4)
- (3, 4, 4)

The program fails to check if the sum of the two smaller sides is greater than the largest side. This oversight leads to incorrect results for inputs where valid triangles exist.
