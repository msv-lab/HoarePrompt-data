Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is one of "CDHS"; an input is taken and stored in a variable.**

The code `input()` reads an input from the user and stores it in a variable (usually named `input()` by default), but since no specific variable name is given, we assume it is stored in a variable (let's call it `input_var`). However, the exact value of this input is not specified, so we keep the initial conditions intact except for noting that an input has been taken.
