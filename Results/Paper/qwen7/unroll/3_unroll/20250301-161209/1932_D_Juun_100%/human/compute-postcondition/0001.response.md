Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and `trump` is the input string entered by the user.**

The code assigns the value of the input string to the variable `trump`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The input string can be any valid string, but it will be stored in the variable `trump`.
