Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to determine how many values of \( k \) satisfy the given conditions for each test case. The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and we need to find \( k \) such that the position \( x \) and the number Vasya received match the settling pattern.

2. **Key Points from the Program**:
   - The program iterates over test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates possible values of \( k \) using the divisors of certain expressions involving \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It uses a helper function `func_1` to get divisors of numbers.

3. **Analysis of the Program**:
   - The expression `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` checks if the length of the segment where the settling pattern fits into \( n \) positions is even.
   - The expression `(n - x) % 2 == 0` checks if the length of another segment is even.
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of a number, including those less than or equal to the square root and their corresponding quotients.
   - The logic to filter valid \( k \) values seems correct, as it ensures \( k \geq 2 \) and matches the position and number Vasya received.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The program handles edge cases like \( k = 1 \) by ensuring \( k > 1 \).
   - The logic to find and filter \( k \) values is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

Given the execution summary and the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
