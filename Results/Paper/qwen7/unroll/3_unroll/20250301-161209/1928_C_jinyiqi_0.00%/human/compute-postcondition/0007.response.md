Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `x`, which is an integer. It returns a list that is the concatenation of `output2` (containing the corresponding quotients for each divisor) and `output1` (containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, but in reverse order).**
