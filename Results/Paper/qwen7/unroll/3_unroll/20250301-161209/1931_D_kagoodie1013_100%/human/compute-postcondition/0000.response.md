Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), x and y (integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9), and a list of n integers a (such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9); `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The initial state of `test_cases` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated information about the `results` list being initialized as an empty list, while the `test_cases` list retains its original structure and values.
