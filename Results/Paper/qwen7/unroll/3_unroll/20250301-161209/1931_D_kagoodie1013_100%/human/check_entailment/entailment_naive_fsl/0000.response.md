Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. It reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the number of pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\). The program uses a dictionary to keep track of the residues of the array elements modulo \(x\) and \(y\), which helps in efficiently counting the pairs. The implementation handles all the constraints and examples provided in the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
