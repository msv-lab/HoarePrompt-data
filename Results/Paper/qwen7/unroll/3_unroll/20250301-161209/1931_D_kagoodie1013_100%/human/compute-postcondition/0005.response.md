Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5), `x` and `y` (integers between 1 and 10^9), and a list of `n` integers `a` (each between 1 and 10^9). The function returns a list of integers named `results`, where each integer represents the count of unique residue pairs (r_x, r_y) for each corresponding test case in `test_cases`.**

This means the function processes each test case by iterating through the list `a`, calculating the residues of each element with respect to `x` and `y`, and counting the number of unique pairs (r_x, r_y) encountered. The results for each test case are then compiled into a list and returned.
