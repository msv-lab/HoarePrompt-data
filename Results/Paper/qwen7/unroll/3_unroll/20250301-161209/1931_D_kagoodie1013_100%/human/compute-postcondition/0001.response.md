Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head `(n, x, y, arr)` indicates that the loop will iterate over each tuple in `test_cases`. Therefore, the variables involved are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: 
   - `n`: An integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `x`: An integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\).
   - `y`: An integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 10^9\).
   - `arr`: A list of \(n\) integers, each such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

3. **Ensure the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, there must be at least one tuple in `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop head involves `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and the loop will only execute if `test_cases` is not empty, we need to ensure that `test_cases` is non-empty. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` within each tuple can vary, but they must meet their respective constraints.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `test_cases` must be a non-empty list.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples, where each tuple contains integers `n` (such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)), `x` (such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\)), `y` (such that \(1 \leq y \leq 10^9\)), and a list `arr` of \(n\) integers (each such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\))**.
