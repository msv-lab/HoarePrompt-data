Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding pairs of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) in an array \(a\) such that both conditions are satisfied:
   - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\)
   - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\)

2. The provided solution uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the occurrences of residue pairs \((r_x, r_y)\) where:
   - \(r_x = -a_i \mod x\)
   - \(r_y = a_i \mod y\)

3. For each element \(a_i\) in the array, the code calculates its residues \(r_x\) and \(r_y\), and checks how many times this pair has been seen before in the dictionary. This count is added to the overall count of beautiful pairs.

4. The logic for calculating residues and updating the count is correct. The use of negative residue for \(r_x\) ensures that the condition \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \mod x\) is met when the residues add up to zero.

5. The approach correctly iterates through the array once per test case, making efficient use of a hash map to store and look up residue pairs.

6. The final result is a list of counts for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
