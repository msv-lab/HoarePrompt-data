Output State: **The program returns a list of integers named `results` where each integer represents the count of unique residue pairs (r_x, r_y) for each corresponding test case in `test_cases`. Each test case involves iterating through the list `arr`, calculating the residues of each element with respect to `x` and `y`, and counting the number of such unique pairs encountered.**

This output state describes the final state of the `results` list after processing each test case in `test_cases`, where each element in `results` is the count of unique residue pairs `(r_x, r_y)` observed during the iteration through `arr` for that particular test case.
