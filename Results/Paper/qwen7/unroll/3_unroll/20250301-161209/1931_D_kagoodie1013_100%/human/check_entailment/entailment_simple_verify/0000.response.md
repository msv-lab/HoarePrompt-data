### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`.
   - It then splits the input into individual components and parses the test cases.
   - This part of the code correctly handles reading and parsing the input as described in the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates over each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs.
   - For each test case, it initializes a counter `count` to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to store the counts of residues.
   - It then iterates over each element in the array `arr` and calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y` for each element.
   - The key insight here is that a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful if and only if there exist residues \(r_x\) and \(r_y\) such that:
     - \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\)
     - \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\)
   - These conditions can be rewritten as:
     - \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\)
     - \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\)
   - By storing the residues in `residue_map`, the program efficiently counts how many times each pair of residues has occurred, which directly corresponds to the number of beautiful pairs.

3. **Residue Calculation and Pair Counting:**
   - The calculation of residues `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y` ensures that the conditions for a beautiful pair are met.
   - The use of the dictionary `residue_map` to count occurrences of these residues allows the program to efficiently determine the number of beautiful pairs without having to explicitly check every pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\).

4. **Output Generation:**
   - The program correctly generates the output by appending the count of beautiful pairs for each test case to the `results` list and then printing the results.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. The annotations and the structure of the code align with the problem description and the requirements specified.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct for all potential cases as it accurately implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array, as described in the problem statement.
