Output State: `results` is a list of integers where each integer represents the value of `count` calculated for each corresponding test case in `test_cases`. For each test case, `count` is determined by iterating through the list `arr`, calculating the residues of each element with respect to `x` and `y`, and counting the number of pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` that have been seen before.
