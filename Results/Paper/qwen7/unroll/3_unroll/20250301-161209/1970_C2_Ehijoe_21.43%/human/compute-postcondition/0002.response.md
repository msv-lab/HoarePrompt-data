Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `empty` is True.**

Explanation: The code assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `empty`. This changes the value of `empty` from its initial state (which was undefined) to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged.
