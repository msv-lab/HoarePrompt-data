Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing (u, v) pairs for each edge entered during the loop, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and each key in `nodes` corresponds to a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes based on the edges provided.

This output state describes how the `nodes` dictionary will represent the graph after reading `n-1` edges from the input. Each node will have a list of its adjacent nodes.
