Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n.**

The code initializes an empty list named `edges`. This does not change the values of `n`, `t`, or `start`, but it sets `edges` to an empty list. The constraints and initial values of `n`, `t`, and `start` remain unchanged.
