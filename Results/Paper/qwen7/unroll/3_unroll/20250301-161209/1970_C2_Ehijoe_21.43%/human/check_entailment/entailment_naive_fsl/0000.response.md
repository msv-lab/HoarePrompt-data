Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules for determining the winner. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to calculate the distances from the starting node to all other nodes, but it does not account for the game's alternating moves between Ron and Hermione. The logic in `func_2` checks if any of the calculated distances are odd, which is not a correct strategy for determining the winner.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the game rounds, considering the optimal moves for both players. The current implementation does not simulate the game rounds and only checks the distances, which is insufficient for determining the winner based on the game rules.
