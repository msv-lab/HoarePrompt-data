Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Range of the Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1` (inclusive).

3. **Initial Value of `i`:**
   - At the start of the loop, `i` should be `1` because the loop starts iterating from `1`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.
   - Since `n` is given as an input integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 24`, `n + 1` will be between `3` and `25`.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` is set to `1` at the start of the loop.
   - The value of `n` does not need to be adjusted because it is already within the valid range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 1**
