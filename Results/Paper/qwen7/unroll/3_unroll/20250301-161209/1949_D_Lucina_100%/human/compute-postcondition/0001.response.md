Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the new list `a` is created with its length determined by `n + 1`.
