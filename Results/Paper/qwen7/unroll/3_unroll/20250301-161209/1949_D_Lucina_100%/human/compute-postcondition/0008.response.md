Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the number of times the character 'F' was encountered at the corresponding index across all inputs; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the number of times the character 'S' was encountered at the corresponding index across all inputs; `xx` is a list containing `n` elements, each being a string input from the loop; `sa` is an empty list; `sb` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `sb`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
