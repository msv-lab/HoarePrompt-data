Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Transition Video Decisions**: The logic for deciding whether a transition video should be 'F' or 'S' is flawed. The current implementation does not ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type appear consecutively for any permutation of the scenarios.

2. **Incorrect Array Initialization and Usage**: Arrays `a` and `b` are initialized with size `n+1`, but they are not used correctly to count the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions. Instead, the code uses these arrays to store indices of undecided transitions, which is unnecessary and complicates the logic.

3. **Incomplete Logic for Decision Making**: The logic for deciding 'F' or 'S' for undecided transitions (`?`) is incomplete and does not cover all necessary cases. The current approach only considers a small subset of scenarios and does not ensure the constraint is met for all permutations.

4. **Missing Key Constraints**: The solution does not handle the constraint that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type should appear for any permutation of the scenarios. This is a critical requirement that the current implementation fails to address.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to implement a more sophisticated algorithm that ensures the constraint is met for all possible permutations of the scenarios. This typically involves using a backtracking or greedy approach to assign 'F' or 'S' values to undecided transitions while checking the constraint after each assignment.

Here's a high-level outline of a potential correct solution:

1. **Count Decided Transitions**: Count the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each pair of scenarios.
2. **Identify Undecided Transitions**: Identify all undecided ('?') transitions.
3. **Assign Values Greedily**: Assign 'F' or 'S' to undecided transitions while ensuring the constraint is met. This can be done by trying both 'F' and 'S' and backtracking if the constraint is violated.
4. **Check All Permutations**: Ensure that the solution works for all permutations of the scenarios.

Given the complexity of the problem, a complete and correct implementation would be significantly more involved than the provided solution.
