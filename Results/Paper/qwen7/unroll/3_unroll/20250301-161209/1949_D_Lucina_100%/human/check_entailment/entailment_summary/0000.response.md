Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by determining the type of transition videos for undecided cells based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' for each scenario. However, the logic in the program is flawed and does not fully adhere to the problem's requirements. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Undecided Cells**: The program tries to decide the type of transition video for undecided cells ('?') based on the counts of 'F' and 'S'. However, it does not correctly handle the constraint that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type should appear consecutively for any permutation of scenarios.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Deciding Video Types**: The program uses a simple comparison of counts of 'F' and 'S' for each scenario to decide the type of transition videos for undecided cells. This approach does not ensure that the constraint about consecutive videos is met for all permutations of scenarios.

3. **Incomplete Implementation**: The program does not fully implement the required logic to ensure the constraint is met. Specifically, it does not consider the impact of the permutation of scenarios on the sequence of transition videos.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is False.

Correctness: **False**
