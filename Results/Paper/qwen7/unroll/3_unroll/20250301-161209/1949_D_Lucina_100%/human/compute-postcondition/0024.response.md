Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the loop head.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i` reaches `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` should start at `1`.

3. **Determine the Range of `n`:**
   - The value of `n` is given as an input integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 24`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` starts at `1` and the loop runs up to `n + 1`, we need to ensure that `i` starts at `1` and `n` is within the valid range.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` starting at `1` and `n` being within the valid range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1**
