Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is initialized to 1 and incremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` set to 1 (as per the `range(1, n + 1)`), we need to ensure that `i` is initially 1.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `1 <= i < n + 1`. This means the loop will run as long as `i` is within this range. Given that `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `i` is set to 1 at the start of the loop. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, and `sb`) do not affect the loop's ability to execute based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1**
