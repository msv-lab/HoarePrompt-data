Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The program handles the different conditions specified in the problem statement:
   - If `b <= a`, it calculates the profit as `n * a`.
   - If `b - a >= n`, it calculates the profit using the formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `2b - n + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit as the sum of the first `(b - a)` natural numbers plus `a * n`.

Given the problem description and the provided conditions, the logic in the program appears to be correct. The formulas used for calculating the profit in each condition match the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
