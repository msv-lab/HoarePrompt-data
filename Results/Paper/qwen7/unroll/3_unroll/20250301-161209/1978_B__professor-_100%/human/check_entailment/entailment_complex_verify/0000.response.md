### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Case 1: \( b \leq a \)**
   - The program correctly calculates the profit as \( n \times a \).
   - This is correct because selling all buns at the usual price \( a \) is the best option when \( b \leq a \).

2. **Case 2: \( b - a \geq n \)**
   - The program correctly calculates the profit using the formula \( \frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2} \).
   - This is correct because selling the first \( n \) buns at the modified prices \( b, b-1, \ldots, b-n+1 \) and the remaining buns at \( a \) is the best option when \( b - a \geq n \).

3. **Case 3: \( a < b < n \)**
   - The program uses the formula \( (b - a) \times (b - a + 1) / 2 + a \times n \).
   - We need to verify if this is indeed the optimal strategy.

To determine the optimal strategy for \( a < b < n \), we should compare the profit obtained by selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified prices and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \), for \( 0 \leq k \leq n \).

Let's derive the general formula for the profit when \( a < b < n \):

- The profit from selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified prices is:
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) = \sum_{j=b-k+1}^{b} j = \frac{k(2b - k + 1)}{2}
  \]
- The profit from selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \) is:
  \[
  a \times (n - k)
  \]
- Therefore, the total profit is:
  \[
  \frac{k(2b - k + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - k)
  \]

We need to find the value of \( k \) that maximizes this expression. To do this, we can take the derivative with respect to \( k \) and set it to zero:

\[
\frac{d}{dk} \left( \frac{k(2b - k + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - k) \right) = \frac{2b - 2k + 1}{2} - a = 0
\]

Solving for \( k \):

\[
2b - 2k + 1 = 2a \implies 2k = 2b - 2a + 1 \implies k = b - a + \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since \( k \) must be an integer, we round \( k \) to the nearest integer. This confirms that the formula used in the program is indeed correct for the optimal strategy.

Given the analysis, the program correctly handles all cases, including the case \( a < b < n \).

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct and handles all cases as required by the problem statement.
