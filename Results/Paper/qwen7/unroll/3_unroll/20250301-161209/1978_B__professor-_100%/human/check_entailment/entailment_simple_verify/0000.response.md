### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the given problem description.

1. **Initial Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: \( b \leq a \)**
     - The program correctly prints `n * a`, which means selling all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - **Case 2: \( b - a \geq n \)**
     - The program correctly prints the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `2b - n + 1`. This is derived from the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - **Case 3: \( a < b < n \)**
     - The program uses the formula \( (b - a) \times (b - a + 1) / 2 + a \times n \). We need to verify if this is the correct approach.

Let's derive the correct formula for the general case where \( a < b < n \):

- The optimal strategy is to sell the first `k` buns at the modified prices, where the price of the `i`-th bun is \( b - i + 1 \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \).
- The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

To maximize the profit, we need to find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit. The profit from selling the first `k` buns is the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from `b` with a common difference of `-1`.

The sum of the first `k` terms of this sequence is:
\[ S_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - (i - 1)) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - (i - 1)) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - (i - 1)) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - (i - 1)) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - (i - 1)) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - (i - 1)) \]

Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
\[ S_k = \frac{k(2b - k + 1)}{2} \]

The profit from selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price `a` is:
\[ P_{\text{remaining}} = a \times (n - k) \]

Thus, the total profit is:
\[ P = \frac{k(2b - k + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - k) \]

We need to find the value of `k` that maximizes this expression. By analyzing the expression, we can see that the program's current formula \( (b - a) \times (b - a + 1) / 2 + a \times n \) is indeed correct for the optimal `k`.

Given the analysis, the program correctly handles all cases and uses the correct formula for the optimal strategy.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the given test cases.
