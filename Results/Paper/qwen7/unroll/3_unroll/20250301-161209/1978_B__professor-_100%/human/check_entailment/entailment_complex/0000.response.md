Reasoning:
1. The problem statement describes a specific strategy for calculating the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling buns under a promotional offer.
2. The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - It handles the case where \( b \leq a \), which means no promotional offer is beneficial, and the profit is simply \( n \times a \).
   - It handles the case where \( b - a \geq n \), which means selling all buns at the modified price starting from \( b \) down to \( b - (n-1) \) maximizes the profit.
   - It handles the general case where \( b - a < n \), which involves selling the first \( b - a + 1 \) buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price \( a \).

Given the provided logic and the annotations, the program correctly calculates the maximum profit for each test case according to the rules specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
