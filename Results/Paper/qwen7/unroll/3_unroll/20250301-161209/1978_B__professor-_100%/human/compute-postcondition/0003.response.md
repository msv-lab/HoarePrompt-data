Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers. For each test case defined by the input integer `t`, the output will be calculated based on the conditions provided within the loop. Specifically, if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the output will be `n * a`. If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the output will be the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `2b - n + 1`. Otherwise, the output will be the sum of the first `(b - a)` natural numbers plus `a * n`.

This output state will be a list of integers, one for each test case, following the logic described above.
