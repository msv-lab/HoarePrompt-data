Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used to iterate over the range returned by `int(input())`.
   - The value of `int(input())` determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - The variable `_` is a placeholder and doesn't hold any specific value within the loop. It is used to control the number of iterations.
   - The value of `int(input())` is what controls the number of iterations, but since we don't know the exact input from the user, we need to ensure that the loop can potentially run at least once.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is a positive integer (since it's specified that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`).

3. **State Adjustment**:
   - We need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is a valid positive integer within the specified range.

Given these considerations, the state adjustments needed are:

- Ensure that the input to `int(input())` is a positive integer within the range `[1, 10^4]`.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.
