### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made of identical elements by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Key Observation**: For an array to be beautiful, there must be at least one position `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`) such that `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`. This means that adjacent pairs of elements must be equal at some points in the array.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided function `func()` iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments where elements are the same.
   - It initializes `same` to count the length of consecutive segments and `minn` to store the minimum length found.
   - The loop iterates through the array, updating `num` and `same` as it encounters different elements.
   - After the loop, `minn` is checked to determine if any segment was found, and the result is printed accordingly.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for finding the minimum length of consecutive segments is correct.
   - The condition to check if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements is also correctly implemented.
   - The handling of the case where no such segment exists (i.e., printing `-1`) is appropriate.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where the entire array is identical (`minn` remains `inf`), correctly printing `-1`.
   - The code correctly identifies and prints the minimum number of elements to remove for arrays that are not entirely identical.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided function `func()` correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
