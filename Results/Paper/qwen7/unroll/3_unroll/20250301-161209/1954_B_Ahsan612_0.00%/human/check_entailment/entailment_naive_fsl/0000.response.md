Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the array can be reduced to a non-beautiful state by removing fewer elements than the minimum calculated.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
3
6
1 2 1 2 1 2
4
3 3 3 3
2
2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
1
-1
1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
1
-1
1
```

For the third test case `[2, 1]`, the program incorrectly outputs `1` because it does not consider that removing the first element (`2`) would result in the array `[1]`, which is not beautiful and requires only one removal. The program should output `-1` because it is already impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing fewer elements.

The program's logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed and does not account for all possible scenarios where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing fewer elements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
