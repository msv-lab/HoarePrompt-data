### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. It also correctly reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`ar`).

2. **Initialization**: The variables `same`, `num`, and `minn` are initialized appropriately. `same` keeps track of the current streak of the same number, `num` stores the current number being tracked, and `minn` stores the minimum length of any streak of the same number found.

3. **Loop Through Array**: The loop iterates through the array starting from the second element (index 1) to the last element. It checks if the current element is the same as the previous one (`ar[i-1]`). If they are the same, it increments the `same` counter. If they are different, it updates `num` to the new number and resets `same` to 1. This ensures that `same` always represents the length of the current streak of the same number.

4. **Finding Minimum Streak Length**: After processing the entire array, the program finds the minimum length of any streak of the same number using `minn`. If no such streak exists (i.e., `minn` remains `inf`), it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the value of `minn`.

5. **Output**: The output is correct according to the problem statement. If the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the beauty condition.

Given the above analysis, the program logic aligns with the problem requirements and produces the correct output for the given examples.

### Correctness:
