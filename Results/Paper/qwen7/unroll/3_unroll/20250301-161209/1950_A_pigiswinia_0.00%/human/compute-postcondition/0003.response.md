Output State: The output state will consist of 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided. Specifically, for each input triplet (a, b, c), if \(a < b < c\), it prints 'STAIRS'; if \(a < b > c\), it prints 'PEAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. The exact sequence of these outputs depends on the user's input during each iteration.
