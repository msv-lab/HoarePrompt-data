Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- Either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is greater than 0.

The print statement simply outputs the integer `0`.

Since the problem does not specify any particular values for `x` and `y` other than the conditions mentioned, the print statement will always output `0`.

Output: **0**
