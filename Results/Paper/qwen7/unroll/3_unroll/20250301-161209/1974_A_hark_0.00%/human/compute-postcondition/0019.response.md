Functionality: **The function processes two non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \), representing the number of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, respectively. It adjusts \( x \) based on the value of \( y \) and prints the sum of \( bxsfory \) and \( bxsfory1 \). If \( x \) is 0 and \( y \) is greater than 0, it prints \( bxsfory \). If \( x \) is greater than 0 and \( y \) is 0, it prints \( bxsfory1 \). In all other cases, it prints 0.**
