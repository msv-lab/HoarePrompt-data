Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the minimum number of screens needed to place all the icons given the constraints of the grid size (5x3) and the sizes of the icons (1x1 and 2x2).
- The provided code consists of three functions:
  1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function returns the smaller of two values, which is not directly used in the main logic but might be part of a larger algorithm.
  2. `func_2()`: This function calculates the minimum number of screens needed based on the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. It correctly handles different scenarios:
     - If both \( x \) and \( y \) are positive, it calculates the number of screens needed after adjusting \( x \) based on \( y \).
     - If only \( y \) is positive, it calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
     - If only \( x \) is positive, it calculates the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons.
     - If neither \( x \) nor \( y \) is positive, it prints 0, indicating no screens are needed.
  3. `func_3()`: This function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_2()`.

Given that `func_2()` correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for each test case and `func_3()` properly handles multiple test cases, the overall program meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
