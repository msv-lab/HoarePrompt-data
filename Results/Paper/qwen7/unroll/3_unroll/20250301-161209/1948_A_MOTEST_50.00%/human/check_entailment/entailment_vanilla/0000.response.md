Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program clears the console using `os.system('cls')`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Special Character Count Check:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string.
   - Otherwise, it proceeds to construct a string with `n` special characters.

3. **String Construction Logic:**
   - The program uses the uppercase Latin alphabet (`string.ascii_uppercase`).
   - It initializes an empty string `ans` and a counter `x` to keep track of the current character index.
   - Depending on whether `n` is even or odd, it constructs the string:
     - If `n` is even, it alternates between two different characters, repeating each pair twice.
     - If `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA' and then alternates similarly.

4. **Verification of Special Characters:**
   - The constructed string will have special characters at positions where a character differs from its neighbors.
   - For even `n`, the string will have special characters at every other position.
   - For odd `n`, the string will start with three identical characters, followed by alternating pairs, ensuring the required number of special characters.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints "YES" followed by the constructed string.
   - If `n` is 1, it prints "NO".

### Testing Examples:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 6`
  - Expected Output: 
    ```
    YES
    AAABAACC
    ```
  - The string "AAABAACC" has 6 special characters (positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8).

- **Test Case 2:** `n = 1`
  - Expected Output: 
    ```
    NO
    ```

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 2`
  - Expected Output: 
    ```
    YES
    MM
    ```

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all test cases as per the problem statement. It checks for the special condition when `n` is 1 and constructs a valid string for other values of `n`. The logic ensures that the constructed string meets the requirement of having exactly `n` special characters.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
