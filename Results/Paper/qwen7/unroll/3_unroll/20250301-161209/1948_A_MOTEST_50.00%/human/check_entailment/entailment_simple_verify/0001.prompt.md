You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                (ans, x) = ('AAA', 1)
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program clears the console using `os.system('cls')`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Special Character Count Check:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string.
   - Otherwise, it proceeds to construct a string with `n` special characters.

3. **String Construction Logic:**
   - The program uses the uppercase Latin alphabet (`string.ascii_uppercase`).
   - It initializes an empty string `ans` and a counter `x` to keep track of the current character index.
   - Depending on whether `n` is even or odd, it constructs the string:
     - If `n` is even, it alternates between two different characters, repeating each pair twice.
     - If `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA' and then alternates similarly.

4. **Verification of Special Characters:**
   - The constructed string will have special characters at positions where a character differs from its neighbors.
   - For even `n`, the string will have special characters at every other position.
   - For odd `n`, the string will start with three identical characters, followed by alternating pairs, ensuring the required number of special characters.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints "YES" followed by the constructed string.
   - If `n` is 1, it prints "NO".

### Testing Examples:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 6`
  - Expected Output: 
    ```
    YES
    AAABAACC
    ```
  - The string "AAABAACC" has 6 special characters (positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8).

- **Test Case 2:** `n = 1`
  - Expected Output: 
    ```
    NO
    ```

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 2`
  - Expected Output: 
    ```
    YES
    MM
    ```

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all test cases as per the problem statement. It checks for the special condition when `n` is 1 and constructs a valid string for other values of `n`. The logic ensures that the constructed string meets the requirement of having exactly `n` special characters.

Correctness: **True**
