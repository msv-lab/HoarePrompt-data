The `os.system('cls')` command is used to clear the terminal or command prompt screen. However, this command does not affect the values of variables. The initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.**
