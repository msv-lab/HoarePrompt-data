Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic inside the loop does not properly handle the calculation of penalties for subsequences `s` and `t`.

Here's an example to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the input:
```
5
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The program attempts to find the minimum possible penalty by tracking two variables `x` and `y`, but it does not correctly compute the penalties for the two subsequences `s` and `t`. The logic for updating `x` and `y` and incrementing `ans` is flawed and does not ensure that the subsequences `s` and `t` are formed in a way that minimizes the penalty.

A correct approach would involve sorting the array and then splitting it into two subsequences to minimize the number of increasing pairs across the split. However, the current implementation does not achieve this.

For instance, in the given example, the correct minimum penalty should be calculated by splitting the array optimally, which results in a penalty of 3, as explained in the problem statement. The provided program does not achieve this optimal result.
