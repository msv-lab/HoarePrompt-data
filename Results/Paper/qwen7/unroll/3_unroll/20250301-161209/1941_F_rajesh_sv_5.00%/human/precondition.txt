t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. The list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 \cdot 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}. The list d contains m integers such that 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9. The list f contains k integers such that 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9.
