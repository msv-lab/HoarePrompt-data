Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found between consecutive elements in the list `A` starting from index 1 to `n-1`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found under the same conditions, and `index` is the index `i` where `max_diff` was last updated; `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the values of `A[index - 1]` to the variable `left` and `A[index]` to the variable `right`. The values of `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` remain unchanged from their initial state.
