Functionality: **The function determines and prints the minimum difference between the sum of a problem complexity and a function complexity, and the sum of a model complexity and a function complexity. Specifically, it finds the maximum difference between consecutive problem complexities, then iterates through each function complexity to find the smallest possible difference by comparing the sums involving problems, models, and functions. Finally, it outputs the larger of the maximum difference or the second maximum difference.**
