n, m, and k are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2 * 10^5; A is a list of n integers where A[i] represents the complexity of the i-th prepared problem and A[i] < A[i + 1]; D is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models; F is a list of k integers representing the complexities of the functions; the maximum value of A[i] does not exceed 2 * 10^9.
