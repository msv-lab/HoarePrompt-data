Output State: **`testcases` is a list of test cases generated by `func_3()`, and all other variables (t, n, m, k, a, d, f) retain their initial values.**

Explanation: The line `testcases = func_3()` assigns the result of the function `func_3()` to the variable `testcases`. However, since the function `func_3()` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact output. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `d`, `f`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
