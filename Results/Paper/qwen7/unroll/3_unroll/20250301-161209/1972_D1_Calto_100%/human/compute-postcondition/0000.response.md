The only variable in the loop head is `b`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero (i.e., `b` is truthy), the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\). Since `b` is a positive integer, it is guaranteed to be non-zero. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `b`.

However, to ensure the loop can execute, `b` must be non-zero. Given that `b` is a positive integer, it is already non-zero.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\)**
