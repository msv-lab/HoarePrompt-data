Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now set to the integer input value; no other variables are defined or changed.**

This means that the variable `t` has been updated to the integer value entered by the user, while the initial conditions for `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unaltered and will be read in the next lines of the code.
