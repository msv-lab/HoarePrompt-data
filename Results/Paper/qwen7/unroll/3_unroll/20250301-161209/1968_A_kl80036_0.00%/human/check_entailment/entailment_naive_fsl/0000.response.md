Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly find an integer \( y \) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. Instead, it simply sets \( y \) to be half of \( x \), which does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

For example, consider the input \( x = 10 \). The program outputs \( y = 5 \), but \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10\). However, if we choose \( y = 9 \), then \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 10\), which is the same value but choosing \( y = 9 \) might be a better solution depending on the definition of "maximum possible" in the context of \(\gcd\).

A correct approach would involve iterating through all possible values of \( y \) from 1 to \( x-1 \) and calculating \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) to find the maximum value.
