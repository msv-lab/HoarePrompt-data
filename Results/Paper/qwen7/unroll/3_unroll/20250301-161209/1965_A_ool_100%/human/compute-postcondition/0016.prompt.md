You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, and the length of arr (n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Each element in arr (a_i) satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    if (set_[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns the string 'Alice'
    #State: `A` is False; `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order. The first element of `set_` is 1
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: Output State: `A` is True; `not_c` is False; `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order. The first element of `set_` is 1.
    #
    #Explanation: 
    #- The loop iterates over the elements of `set_` starting from the second element (index 1) and checks the difference between consecutive elements.
    #- If the difference is greater than 1, `not_c` is set to False and the loop breaks.
    #- The variable `A` is toggled (flipped) between True and False with each iteration of the loop.
    #- Since the loop starts from index 1, it will check the difference between `set_[1]` and `set_[0]`. If the difference is greater than 1, the loop will break immediately, setting `not_c` to False.
    #- If the difference is not greater than 1 for any pair of consecutive elements, `A` will toggle between True and False based on the number of iterations, which will result in `A` being True after an even number of iterations or False after an odd number of iterations. Given the loop starts from index 1 and iterates up to `len(set_) - 1`, if `set_` has an even number of elements, `A` will end up as True (since it starts as False and toggles an even number of times). If `set_` has an odd number of elements, `A` would end up as False, but since we don't know the exact number of elements in `set_`, we can only say it ends as True based on the provided information.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: `A` is True, `not_c` is False, and `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with the first element being 1. If the difference between any two consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1, `not_c` remains False. Otherwise, `A` toggles between True and False based on the number of iterations.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice' if the condition A is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. Given that A is initially True, the program returns 'Alice'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The length of arr (n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and each element in arr (a_i) satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The function returns 'Alice' if the condition A is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. Given that A is initially True, the function returns 'Alice'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string 'Alice'

Case_2: The program returns 'Alice' if the condition A is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. Given that A is initially True, the program returns 'Alice'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
