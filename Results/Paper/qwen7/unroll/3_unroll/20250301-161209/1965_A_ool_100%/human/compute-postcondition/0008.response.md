Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(set_) - 1`. This means `i` starts at `1` and goes up to but does not include `len(set_)`.
3. **Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being `1`, we need to ensure that `i` is initially set to `1`.
4. **Initial State of `set_`**: The problem states that `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is `1`. This information is already given and doesn't need adjustment.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`A` is False, `not_c` is True, `i` is 1, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with the first element being 1**
