Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a list `a` containing `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). Each integer in the list appears at most twice, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. The function returns the result for each test case, which could be a specific outcome or a list of outcomes based on the processing of the integers in the list `a`.**
