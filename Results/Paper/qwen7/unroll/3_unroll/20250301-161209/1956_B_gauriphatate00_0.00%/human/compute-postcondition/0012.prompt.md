You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, representing the number of cards you and Nene receive initially. The list a contains n integers, where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the list a at most 2 times, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input on whitespace, `idx` is `2 + 2*t`, `results` is a list of length `t` where each element is the result of calling `func_1(n, a)` with appropriate parameters.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: t is the integer value of data[0], n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, data is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input on whitespace, idx is 2 + 2*t, results is a list of length t where each element is the result of calling func_1(n, a), and the loop has printed each element in the results list once.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a list `a` containing `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). Each integer in the list appears at most twice, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. The function returns the result for each test case, which could be a specific outcome or a list of outcomes based on the processing of the integers in the list `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
