Output State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input on whitespace, `idx` is `2 + 2*t`, `results` is a list of length `t` where each element is the result of calling `func_1(n, a)` with `n` being the integer at `data[idx-2+i]` and `a` being a list of integers obtained from `data[idx-1+i:idx-1+n+i]` for `i` in range `t`.
