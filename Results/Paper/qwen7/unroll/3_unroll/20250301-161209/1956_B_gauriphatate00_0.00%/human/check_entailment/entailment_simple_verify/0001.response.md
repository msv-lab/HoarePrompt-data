### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.
   - Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score.
   - You start the game and take turns with Nene.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the minimum between the number of pairs of identical numbers in your hand (`pairs`) and half the number of your cards (`n // 2`).
   - `Counter(a)` counts the occurrences of each number in your hand.
   - `sum((1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2))` counts how many numbers appear exactly twice in your hand.
   - `min(pairs, n // 2)` ensures that you do not score more points than the number of pairs of identical numbers in your hand, which is the best you can achieve against Nene's optimal play.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles reading multiple test cases and processing each one individually.
   - The logic for parsing input and calling `func_1` is correct.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Given Nene's strategy, you should avoid scoring points when possible. This means you should only play a card if it matches a card already on the table.
   - The function correctly identifies the maximum number of such matches you can make, which aligns with the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases like duplicate numbers and different numbers correctly.
   - It ensures that you do not score more points than the number of pairs of identical numbers in your hand.

However, upon closer inspection of the logic in `func_1`, there is a critical flaw in the reasoning. The function `func_1` incorrectly assumes that the number of pairs of identical numbers in your hand directly translates to the maximum number of points you can get. This is not true because Nene's strategy involves minimizing your score while maximizing hers. 

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- Suppose you have the cards `[1, 1, 2, 3]`.
- `func_1` would calculate `pairs = 1` (since there is one pair of 1s) and return `min(1, 2) = 1`. However, this is incorrect because Nene can strategically place cards on the table to prevent you from scoring any points.

In this example, if Nene places the card with the number 1 on the table first, you cannot score any points even though there is a pair of 1s in your hand. Thus, the correct answer should be 0, not 1.

Therefore, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against Nene. The function `func_1` fails to account for Nene's strategic placement of cards, leading to incorrect results.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
