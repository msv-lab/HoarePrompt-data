The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing half the number of cards, and `a`, a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and n, inclusive, and appears at most twice in the list. It calculates the number of elements in the list `a` that appear exactly twice and returns the minimum value between this count and `n // 2`.
