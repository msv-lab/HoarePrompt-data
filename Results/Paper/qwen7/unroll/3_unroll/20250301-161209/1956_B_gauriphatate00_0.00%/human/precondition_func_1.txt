t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, representing the number of cards you and Nene receive initially. The list a contains n integers, where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the list a at most 2 times, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
