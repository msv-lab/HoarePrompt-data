You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: Output State: The output state will depend on the input integer `t` and the strings provided as input within each iteration of the loop. For each input string, the program checks specific conditions and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional details if applicable. If the string meets certain criteria, it may also print indices or substrings. After all iterations, the final output consists of all printed statements from each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each string `s`, it checks specific conditions related to the characters in the string. Based on these conditions, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO', and in some cases, it may also print additional details such as indices or substrings. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness according to the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It also correctly reads each string `string`.

2. **Single Character String Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the string length is 1, printing 'NO' because a single character cannot be split into non-palindromic substrings.

3. **Non-Palindromic First and Last Characters:**
   - If the first and last characters are different, the program prints 'YES' and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring. This is correct because a string with different first and last characters is itself non-palindromic.

4. **All Characters Same:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same, the program prints 'NO'. This is correct because splitting such a string into non-palindromic substrings is impossible.

5. **Single Non-Same Character:**
   - If only one character is different from the rest, the program checks if the string length is odd and the middle character is the same as the other character. If so, it prints 'NO', which is correct. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring. This is correct because the string can be split into non-palindromic substrings if the middle character is different.

6. **General Case:**
   - The program iterates through the string to find the first pair of differing characters. If found, it prints 'YES' and the string as a single non-palindromic substring, which is correct.
   - If no such pair is found, it further checks for specific patterns (like consecutive non-matching characters) and tries to split the string into two non-palindromic substrings. However, this logic seems overly complex and may not cover all edge cases correctly.

### Edge Cases and Specific Scenarios:

- **String with Multiple Non-Same Characters:**
  - The program should handle cases where the string has multiple non-same characters and can be split into multiple non-palindromic substrings. The current implementation may fail to identify such cases correctly.

- **Strings with Repeated Patterns:**
  - The program should ensure that it can handle strings with repeated patterns that do not form palindromes when split. The current implementation may not cover all such cases.

### Conclusion:

The program has several issues and does not fully cover all edge cases and scenarios required by the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is not fully correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
