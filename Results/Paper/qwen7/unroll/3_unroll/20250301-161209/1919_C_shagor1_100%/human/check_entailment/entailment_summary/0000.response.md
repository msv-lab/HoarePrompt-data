Reasoning:
1. The problem requires splitting an array into two subsequences \(s\) and \(t\) to minimize the total penalty, where the penalty is defined as the number of indices \(i\) such that \(b_i < b_{i+1}\).
2. The provided program iterates through the array and uses two variables `la` and `lb` to keep track of the last smaller and larger elements encountered so far.
3. If the current element is less than or equal to `la`, it updates `la`.
4. If the current element is greater than `la` but less than or equal to `lb`, it updates `lb`.
5. If the current element is greater than both `la` and `lb`, it increments the answer `ans` and updates both `la` and `lb`.
6. This logic ensures that we are counting the number of times an element is out of order with respect to the previous elements in the optimal split.

Given the logic, the program correctly implements the strategy to minimize the penalty by ensuring that elements are placed in a way that maximizes the number of increasing sequences in both subsequences.

Correctness: **True**
