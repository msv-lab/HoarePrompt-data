#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i; the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1():
    pass
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `a` of length `n` for `t` test cases, where each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and `n`. It returns a value based on the given conditions, though the specific value is not detailed in the provided information.
