You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of houses, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident wants to live on the right side.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    S = [[0, 0]]
    for s in a:
        x, y = S[-1]
        
        if s == '0':
            x += 1
        else:
            y += 1
        
        S.append([x, y])
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and `S` is a list containing `n+1` sublists, where the first element of each sublist is the count of '0's encountered up to that point in the string `a`, and the second element is the count of '1's encountered up to that point.
    ans = -1
    for i in range(n + 1):
        left = S[i][0]
        
        lsum = i
        
        right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
        
        rsum = n - i
        
        if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
            continue
        elif abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans):
            ans = i
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is the index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `i` and `n/2` while satisfying the condition `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`, where `left` is the count of '0's up to index `i`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is the count of '1's from index `i` to the end, and `rsum` is `n - i`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 3
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` containing only '0' and '1'. It returns a value based on the distribution of '0's (indicating left side) and '1's (indicating right side) in the string `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
