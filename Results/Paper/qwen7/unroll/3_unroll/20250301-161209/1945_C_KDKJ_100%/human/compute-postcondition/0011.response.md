The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the number of houses, and `a`, which is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The string `a` indicates the side each resident wants to live on, where '0' means left and '1' means right. The function returns a value based on the distribution of '0's and '1's in the string `a`.
