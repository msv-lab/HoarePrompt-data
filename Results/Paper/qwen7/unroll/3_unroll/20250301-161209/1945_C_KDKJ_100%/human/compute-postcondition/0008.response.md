Output State: `ans` is the index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `i` and `n/2` while satisfying the condition `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`, where `left` is the count of '0's up to index `i`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is the count of '1's from index `i` to the end, and `rsum` is `n - i`.
