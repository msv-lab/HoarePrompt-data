Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to check if the robot can reach the last column (2, n) when the arrows in the first row do not allow the robot to move down to the second row in the required manner.

Consider the following test case:
```
4
>>><
><>>
```
In this case, the robot starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, 4). The path would be:
1. From (1, 1) to (1, 2) (right arrow in the first row).
2. From (1, 2) to (1, 3) (right arrow in the first row).
3. From (1, 3) to (1, 4) (right arrow in the first row).

Since there is no way for the robot to move down to the second row, the robot cannot reach (2, 4). However, the program incorrectly prints 'YES' because it only checks the last character of the second row and the value of `n`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the robot can reach the last column by checking if there is a valid path from the first row to the second row at each step. This can be done by ensuring that there is at least one sequence of arrows that allows the robot to move down to the second row and then proceed to the last column.
