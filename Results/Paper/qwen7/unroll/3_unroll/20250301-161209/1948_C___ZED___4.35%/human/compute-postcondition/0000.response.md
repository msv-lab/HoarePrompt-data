Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is used to iterate over the range specified by `input()`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `range(int(input()))`. This means that the number of iterations of the loop is determined by the integer value read from the input.

3. **Determine the Initial State**: We are given the following initial state:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `n` is even.
   - Each test case consists of two strings of length `n`, where each character is either `<` or `>`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` provides a positive integer value.
   - Since `t` is the integer value read from the input, it directly determines the number of iterations of the loop.
   - Therefore, the state `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring that it is a positive integer (since `int(input())` will always return a positive integer if the input is valid).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be a positive integer**
