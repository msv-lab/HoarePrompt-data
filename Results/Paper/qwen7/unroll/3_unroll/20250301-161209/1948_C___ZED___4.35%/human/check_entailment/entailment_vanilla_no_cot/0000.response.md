Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `n == 1`:**
   - The code checks if `n == 1` and prints 'YES' immediately. However, this is not always correct. If the only cell is (1, 1) and the arrow points down, the robot should still be able to reach (2, 1).

2. **Incorrect Logic for Even Columns:**
   - The logic for checking if the path exists by examining every other column is flawed. It assumes that if the last but one character in the second row is not '>', the path cannot exist, which is not always true.
   - The logic also incorrectly prints 'NO' without checking all conditions properly.

3. **Handling of Arrow Movements:**
   - The code does not correctly simulate the robot's movement through the grid. It does not account for the robot moving according to the arrows in each cell.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly:**
   - The code does not handle all edge cases, such as when the robot can only move in a specific pattern that allows it to reach (2, n).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the robot's movement through the grid and check if it can reach (2, n). Hereâ€™s a more accurate approach:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Check if the last but one cell in the second row is not '>'
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Simulate the robot's movement
        x, y = 0, 0  # Start at (1, 1)
        while True:
            if x == 1 and y == n - 1 and b[y] == '<':
                break
            elif x == 0 and y == n - 1 and a[y] == '>':
                break
            elif x == 0 and y == 0 and a[y] == '<':
                break
            elif x == 1 and y == 0 and b[y] == '>':
                break
            
            if a[y] == '<':
                x = 0
                y -= 1
            elif a[y] == '>':
                x = 0
                y += 1
            elif b[y] == '<':
                x = 1
                y -= 1
            elif b[y] == '>':
                x = 1
                y += 1
            
            if y < 0 or y >= n:
                break
        
        if x == 1 and y == n - 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This approach correctly simulates the robot's movement and checks if it can reach (2, n).
