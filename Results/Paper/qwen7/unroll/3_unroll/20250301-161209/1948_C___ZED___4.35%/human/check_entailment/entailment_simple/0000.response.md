### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n`, the first row of arrows (`a`), and the second row of arrows (`b`).

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The code checks if `b[-2] != '>'`. If this condition is true, it immediately prints 'NO'. This check ensures that the last but one column in the second row must point right for the robot to potentially reach the last column. However, this check alone is insufficient because it does not consider the entire path.

3. **Special Case for `n == 1`:**
   - The code handles the special case when `n == 1` by printing 'YES'. This is correct because with only one column, the robot can always move to the next row.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The code then enters a loop to check if the robot can reach the last column `(2, n)` by ensuring:
     - The second row has at least one right-pointing arrow in every pair of columns.
     - The first row has at least one right-pointing arrow in every other column between the first and the second-to-last column.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The logic seems to handle the case where the robot needs to move up and down between rows correctly.
   - However, the code does not explicitly handle the scenario where the robot might get stuck in a loop or where the path is blocked due to consecutive left-pointing arrows.

6. **Correctness:**
   - The main issue with the code is that it does not fully account for all possible paths and scenarios. Specifically, it does not ensure that the robot can navigate through the grid without getting stuck or blocked.
   - The code assumes that if the conditions are met, the robot can always find a path, which is not necessarily true. For example, if the first row has a sequence of left-pointing arrows that block the robot from moving right, the robot cannot reach the last column.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem in all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

### Correctness:
**False**
