Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the values of `x` for each test case.
   - This part is correct.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1(t, test_cases)` is defined to process each test case.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - It iterates over each `x` in `test_cases`.

3. **Finding the Best `y`:**
   - For each `x`, it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - It then iterates over all possible `y` from `x-1` down to 1.
   - For each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using `math.gcd(x, y)`.
   - It computes the sum `current_sum = gcd_val + y`.
   - If this sum is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to `y`, then breaks out of the loop to avoid unnecessary checks.

4. **Appending Results:**
   - After finding the best `y` for each `x`, it appends `best_y` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list.

5. **Output Handling:**
   - The program prints each element of the `results` list, which is correct.

### Verification:

- The logic for finding the best `y` is sound. It correctly maximizes the sum `gcd(x, y) + y` by checking all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 1.
- The use of `break` ensures that the first `y` that gives the maximum sum is chosen, which is sufficient as per the problem statement.
- The program handles multiple test cases correctly by processing them sequentially.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the required `y` for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
