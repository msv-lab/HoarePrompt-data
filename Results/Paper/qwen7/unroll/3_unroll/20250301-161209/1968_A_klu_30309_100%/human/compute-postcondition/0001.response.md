Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains three objects - `x`, `test_cases`, and implicitly the loop variable `i` (which is not explicitly named but is used to iterate over `test_cases`).

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `t`: This variable is not directly involved in the loop, so its value does not need to be adjusted.
   - `test_cases`: This is a list of positive integers where each integer `x` satisfies \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\).
   - `results`: This is an empty list.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `test_cases` to iterate over. Therefore, `test_cases` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `test_cases` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `test_cases` is not empty.
   - The loop variable `x` will take the values from `test_cases` one by one, starting from the first element.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `test_cases` must contain at least one element.
- `x` will be set to the first element of `test_cases`.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `test_cases` is a non-empty list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each x in test_cases, and `results` is an empty list.**
