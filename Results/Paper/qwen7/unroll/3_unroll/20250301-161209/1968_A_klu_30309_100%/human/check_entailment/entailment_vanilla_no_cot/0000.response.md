Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers from the input. This part is handled correctly.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to process each test case and find the appropriate `y` value.
3. **Logic for Finding `y`**:
   - It initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - It iterates over all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 1.
   - For each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`.
   - It computes the sum of the GCD and `y`.
   - If this sum is greater than the current `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to `y`, then breaks out of the loop.
   - After processing all possible `y` values, it appends `best_y` to the results list.
4. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work as expected for the provided problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **True**.
