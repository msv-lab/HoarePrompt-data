Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers from the input.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1(t, test_cases)` is defined to process each test case.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

3. **Loop Through Test Cases:**
   - For each test case `x`, it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - It then iterates over all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 1.
   - For each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`.
   - It computes the sum `gcd_val + y` and checks if this sum is greater than the current `max_sum`.
   - If it is, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to `y`, then breaks out of the loop to avoid unnecessary calculations.
   - After processing all `y` values for a given `x`, it appends `best_y` to the `results` list.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints each element of the `results` list, which contains the value of `y` for each test case.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The logic inside the function `func_1` is correct. It correctly finds the `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` for each test case.
  - The loop starts from `x-1` and goes down to 1, ensuring that we check all possible values of `y` that satisfy the condition \(1 \leq y < x\).
  - The use of `break` ensures that once a better `y` is found, no further unnecessary calculations are done, which optimizes the solution.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases well. For example, if `x` is 2, the only possible `y` is 1, and the GCD is 1, so the sum is 2, which is the maximum possible.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
