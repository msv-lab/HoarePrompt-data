You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        results.append(best_y)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers between 2 and 1000. For each `x` in `test_cases`, it calculates the integer `best_y` (where 1 < `y` < `x`) that maximizes the sum of `gcd(x, y) + y`, and returns a list of these `best_y` values corresponding to each `x` in `test_cases`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the values for each test case.
2. **Logic Implementation**: For each test case \( x \), the program iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 1 to find the value of \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). It uses the `math.gcd` function to compute the greatest common divisor.
3. **Break Condition**: Once a suitable \( y \) is found that maximizes the sum, the loop breaks early, ensuring efficiency.
4. **Output**: The program outputs the correct \( y \) for each test case.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the provided description and examples.
