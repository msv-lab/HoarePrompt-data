Reasoning:
1. The program is supposed to handle multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, which represent the number of moves and the desired number of cubes respectively.
3. The logic in `func_1()` checks if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is determined by checking if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`. 
   - If the condition is met, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".
4. The provided code correctly implements the logic for determining whether it's possible to achieve the desired number of cubes after a given number of moves.
5. There are no logical errors or missing parts in the code that would cause it to fail according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
