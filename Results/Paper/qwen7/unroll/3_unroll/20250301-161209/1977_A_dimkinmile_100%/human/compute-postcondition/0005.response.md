Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- The condition \((n - m) \% 2 \neq 0\) or \(n - m < 0\) is true.

The print statement is `print('No')`.

Given the condition \((n - m) \% 2 \neq 0\) or \(n - m < 0\), it means that either the difference between `n` and `m` is odd or the difference is negative. In both cases, the condition evaluates to `True`.

Therefore, the print statement will execute and print the string `'No'`.

Output: **'No'**
