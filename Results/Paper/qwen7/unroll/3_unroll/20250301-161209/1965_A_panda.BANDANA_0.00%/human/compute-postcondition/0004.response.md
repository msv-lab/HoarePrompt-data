Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) indicating the number of test cases, followed by \( t \) groups of data. For each group, it reads a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. It checks if the number 1 is present in the list. If 1 is found in any list, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice' for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
