Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `satisfy` is 0, `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and `S` is a list containing `n+1` sublists. The first sublist is `[0, 0]`, and each subsequent sublist contains two integers where the first integer is the count of '0's encountered up to that point in the string `a`, and the second integer is the count of '1's encountered up to that point.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    left = S[i][0]
    lsum = S[i][0] + S[i][1]
    right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
    rsum = n - lsum
    if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
        continue
    elif abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans):
        ans = i


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
