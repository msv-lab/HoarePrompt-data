### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the optimal position `i` to place a road such that at least half of the residents on both sides of the road are satisfied. This involves checking the counts of '0's and '1's on both sides of each potential position `i`.

2. **Key Steps in the Code**:
   - **Function `func_1`**:
     - Reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a`.
     - Constructs a list `S` where `S[i]` contains the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to the `i-th` house.
     - Iterates through each possible position `i` to check if placing the road at `i` satisfies the condition.
     - If the condition is met (`left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`), it updates the answer `ans` if the current position is closer to the center of the village.
   - **Function `func_2`**:
     - Reads the number of test cases.
     - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Execution States**:
   - The code correctly constructs the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's.
   - It iterates through each position `i` and checks the conditions.
   - The logic to update `ans` when the conditions are met and the position is closer to the center is correct.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where the road can be placed before the first house (`ans = 0`).
   - It correctly identifies the optimal position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference from `n/2`.

5. **Output**:
   - The code prints the correct index `ans` for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position `i` for placing the road. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
