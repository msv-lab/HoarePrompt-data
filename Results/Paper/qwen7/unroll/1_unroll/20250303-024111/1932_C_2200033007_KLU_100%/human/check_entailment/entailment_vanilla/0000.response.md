Reasoning:
1. The program iterates over the test cases using a loop.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.
3. It calls the function `func_1(n, m, a, s)` to process the commands and compute the required remainders.
4. In `func_1`, it initializes an empty list `b` to store intermediate results and sets up pointers `l` and `r` to traverse the array `a` from both ends.
5. It processes each command in the string `s`:
   - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` to `b` and increments the left pointer `l`.
   - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` to `b` and decrements the right pointer `r`.
6. After processing all commands, it computes the product of the elements in `b` modulo `m` and stores the results in reverse order in the list `ans`.
7. The function returns the reversed list `ans`.

The logic in the program matches the problem description accurately. It correctly processes each command, updates the array `a`, and calculates the required remainders. There are no logical errors or missing steps in the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
