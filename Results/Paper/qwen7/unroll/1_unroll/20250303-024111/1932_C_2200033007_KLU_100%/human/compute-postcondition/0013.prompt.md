You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers, a is a list of integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^4], and s is a string consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `l` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^4], `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list where elements are appended based on the direction specified in `s`, `r` is -1.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `l` remains 0 because it is only incremented when the character in `s` is 'L', and there are no 'L' characters at the start of the string `s` (since we are iterating from the beginning). The variable `r` is decremented until it reaches -1, as it starts from `n-1` and is decremented in each iteration corresponding to the 'R' characters in `s`. The list `b` will contain elements from `a` based on the direction specified in `s`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `l` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^4], `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of integers from `a` based on the direction specified in `s`, `r` is -1, `ans` is a list of integers where each integer is the product of all elements in `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`, `p` is -1.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is the product of all elements in list `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`, with the list reversed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^4]), and `s` (a string consisting of `n` characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a list of integers where each integer is the product of all elements in a reversed list `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of integers where each integer is the product of all elements in list `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`, with the list reversed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
