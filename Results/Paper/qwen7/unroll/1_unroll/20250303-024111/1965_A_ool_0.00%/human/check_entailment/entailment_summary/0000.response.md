Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initial Check**: The function checks if the first element of the array is not 1. If true, it returns 'Alice', which aligns with the problem statement where Alice wins if the smallest pile has more than one stone.
   - **Processing Unique Elements**: The function converts the array to a set to get unique values and sorts them. This step is unnecessary because the original array is already processed sequentially.
   - **Gap Check**: The function iterates through the sorted unique elements to check for gaps greater than 1. If such a gap exists, it sets `not_c` to False. This logic is correct as per the problem statement.
   - **Final Decision**: The function returns 'Alice' if `not_c` is False (indicating no gaps greater than 1), otherwise it returns 'Bob'. This is consistent with the problem statement where Alice wins if the piles can be reduced to all having exactly one stone without any gaps.

Based on the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
