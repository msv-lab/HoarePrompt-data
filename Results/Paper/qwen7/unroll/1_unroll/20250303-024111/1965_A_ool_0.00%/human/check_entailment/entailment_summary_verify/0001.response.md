### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles into an array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It checks if the smallest pile has more than one stone. If so, it immediately returns 'Alice' because Alice can always remove one stone from each pile, making the smallest pile size 1, and then Bob will be forced to remove one stone from each pile, eventually leading to Alice winning.
   - If the smallest pile has exactly one stone, it proceeds to check the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes.
   - It uses a loop to iterate through the sorted unique pile sizes and checks if the difference between any two consecutive sizes is greater than 1. If such a difference exists, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - The boolean variable `A` toggles its value in each iteration of the loop.
   - Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' if `A` is `False`.

3. **Optimal Play Consideration**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the winning condition based on the differences between the sizes of the piles.
   - However, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. The current implementation only considers the presence of gaps greater than 1 between consecutive unique pile sizes. This is not sufficient to determine the winner in all cases.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like multiple piles of the same size and different sizes appropriately.
   - The logic correctly identifies when Alice can force a win by making the smallest pile size 1, but it fails to handle other winning conditions.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correct Logic for Winning Condition**:
  - In the Nim game, the key is to ensure that the XOR of the pile sizes is non-zero for a winning position.
  - The current implementation does not use the XOR operation, which is crucial for determining the winner.

- **Example to Illustrate Flaw**:
  - Consider the test case: `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - According to the current logic, `func_1` would return 'Alice' because there are no gaps greater than 1 between the unique pile sizes.
  - However, the correct winner should be determined using the XOR of the pile sizes: `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0`, indicating a losing position for Alice.

### Conclusion:
The given program incorrectly determines the winner based on the differences between the sizes of the piles without considering the XOR operation, which is essential for the correct solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it fails to use the correct logic for determining the winner in the Nim game.
