### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Initial Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case one by one.
   - It reads the number of piles (`n`) and the sizes of the piles (`arr`).
   
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if the smallest pile has more than one stone. If it does, Alice can immediately reduce all piles by the same amount, making them all equal and smaller, leading to Alice's win. This logic is correct.
   - If the smallest pile has exactly one stone, the function proceeds to check if the piles can be reduced to a state where they all have the same value or differ by exactly one. This is done using a set to find unique values and sorting them to check differences.
   - The logic within the loop to check differences between consecutive elements in the sorted unique set is correct. If any difference is greater than 1, the condition `not_c` is set to `False`, indicating that the piles cannot be reduced to a uniform state where all piles have the same value or differ by exactly one.
   - The boolean `A` is toggled based on whether `not_c` is `True` or `False`. Finally, the function returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' if `A` is `False`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the smallest pile has exactly one stone correctly by checking the differences between unique values.
   - The logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the number of piles that can be reduced to a uniform state is sound.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given rules. The function `func_1` accurately determines the winner for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
