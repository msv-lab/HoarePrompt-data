### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles into an array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It checks if the smallest pile has more than one stone. If so, it immediately returns 'Alice' because Alice can always remove one stone from each pile, making the smallest pile size 1, and then Bob will be forced to remove one stone from each pile, eventually leading to Alice winning.
   - This part of the logic is correct and aligns with the game rules.

3. **Checking Differences Between Consecutive Unique Pile Sizes**:
   - The function creates a sorted list of unique elements from `arr` and iterates through them to check if the difference between any two consecutive sizes is greater than 1.
   - If such a difference exists, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - The boolean variable `A` toggles its value in each iteration of the loop.
   - However, the logic here is flawed. The function incorrectly assumes that the presence of any gap greater than 1 between consecutive unique elements means that Bob will win. This is not necessarily true. The correct approach should involve checking the XOR of the unique pile sizes, which is a standard strategy for determining the winner in such games.

4. **Final Return Statement**:
   - The function returns 'Alice' if `not_c` is `False`, and 'Bob' otherwise.
   - Since `not_c` is only set to `False` if there is a gap greater than 1, and this does not correctly reflect the game's strategy, the function's logic is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy. The function `func_1` incorrectly determines the winner based on the presence of gaps in the sorted unique pile sizes, rather than using the XOR strategy.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
