### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads from standard input using `[*open(0)][1:]`, which is equivalent to reading lines from stdin starting from the second line (skipping the first line).

2. **Parsing Input:**
   - For each line, it splits the string into three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

3. **Adjusting Extroverts and Universals:**
   - The line `(a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())` parses the input.
   - The line `b += c` adds the number of universals to the number of extroverts. This adjustment is done because each extrovert requires a full tent of 3 people, and universals can fill any remaining spots.

4. **Calculating Tents:**
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` calculates the number of tents needed:
     - `-b // 3` computes the integer division of \(b\) by 3, which gives the maximum number of full tents that can be filled by extroverts and universals.
     - `a - -b // 3` subtracts this value from the number of introverts, giving the remaining number of introverts who need individual tents.
   - The expression `(-1, -1)[c < b % 3]` checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the last tent:
     - `b % 3` gives the remainder when \(b\) is divided by 3, indicating how many spots are left in the last tent.
     - `c < b % 3` checks if there are enough universals to fill these remaining spots.
     - If there are enough universals, it returns 0; otherwise, it returns -1.

5. **Output:**
   - The result is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Check

- **Handling Introverts:**
  - Each introvert needs a separate tent, so the number of introverts directly contributes to the number of tents needed.

- **Handling Extroverts and Universals:**
  - Each extrovert and universal together can fill a tent of 3 people. By adding the number of universals to the number of extroverts, we ensure that we can maximize the use of tents.
  - The logic correctly handles the distribution of remaining spots in the last tent.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If the number of universals is less than the remainder when the adjusted number of extroverts is divided by 3, it is impossible to fully accommodate everyone, and the program correctly outputs -1.

However, there is a critical issue in the calculation of the number of tents. Specifically, the expression `a - -b // 3` is incorrect. The double negative `- -b // 3` should simply be `b // 3`.

Here is the corrected version of the calculation:
```python
print((a + b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
```

### Detailed Explanation

- **Correct Calculation:**
  - `b // 3` gives the number of full tents that can be filled by extroverts and universals.
  - Adding `a` to `b // 3` ensures that we account for the introverts who need individual tents.

- **Checking Remaining Spots:**
  - `c < b % 3` checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the last tent.
  - If there are enough universals, it returns 0; otherwise, it returns -1.

### Conclusion

The original assessment was incorrect because the expression `a - -b // 3` is not correct. The correct expression should be `a + b // 3`. With this correction, the program will correctly calculate the minimum number of tents needed.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect due to the misinterpretation of the calculation for the number of tents.
