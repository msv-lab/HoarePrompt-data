Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. For each test case, the function determines the possible number of valid seating arrangements given the constraints and returns the count of such arrangements.**
