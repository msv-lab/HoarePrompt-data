Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into tokens.
   - It then processes this input to extract the number of test cases (`t`) and the pairs of integers `(n, k)` for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program creates a sequence of length 25 consisting of powers of 2: `[2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^24]`.
   - This sequence is then added to the results list as a tuple `(25, sequence)`.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - The program iterates through the results and prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself for each test case.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

1. **Sequence Length:**
   - The problem specifies that the sequence should have a size at most 25. The generated sequence has exactly 25 elements, which satisfies this condition.

2. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - The sequence `[2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^24]` does not contain any subsequence that sums to `k`. This is because the sum of any subset of these powers of 2 will be a unique binary number, and none of these sums will equal `k` due to the nature of binary representation.

3. **Subsequences Summing to All Other Values:**
   - For any value `v` where `1 ≤ v ≤ n` and `v ≠ k`, there exists a subsequence of the sequence that sums to `v`. This is because the sequence contains all necessary powers of 2 to form any sum up to \(2^{25} - 1\). Since `n` is at most \(10^6\), and the maximum possible sum of the sequence is \(2^{25} - 1\), any value `v` within the specified range can be formed by selecting appropriate subsets of the sequence.

4. **Correctness of Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` generates the same sequence for each test case, which is correct since the sequence does not depend on the specific values of `n` and `k`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence that meets the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
