Reasoning:

The annotated program describes a function `func_1` that generates a fixed sequence of 25 powers of 2 and returns it for each test case. However, the problem statement requires a sequence `a` that meets specific criteria:
1. There should be no subsequence of `a` that sums to `k`.
2. For all `1 \le v \le n` where `v \ne k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

The proposed solution generates a sequence of 25 powers of 2, which does not necessarily meet these requirements. Specifically:
- The generated sequence will always include the number `1`, meaning there will always be a subsequence that sums to `1` (which is `1` itself).
- The sequence includes many large numbers, making it highly likely that there will be subsequences that sum to `k` for certain values of `k`.

Given that the function always returns the same sequence regardless of the input values `n` and `k`, it fails to meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, the provided function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
