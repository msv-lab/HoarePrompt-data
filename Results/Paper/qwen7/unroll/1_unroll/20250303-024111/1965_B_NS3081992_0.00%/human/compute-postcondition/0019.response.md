Output State: **lk is the length of bk, b is the binary representation of n without the '0b' prefix, k is the second return value of func_7, l is the length of bk, bk is the binary representation of k without the '0b' prefix, and ans is a list containing [1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2)].**

This means that after the loop executes all its iterations, `ans` will contain a list of powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{lk-2}\), where `lk` is the length of `bk`. The other variables (`b`, `k`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
