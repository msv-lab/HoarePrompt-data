    #A list containing the result of func_3() called `rows_number` times
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `rows_number` (1 ≤ `rows_number` ≤ 25) and returns a list containing the result of calling `func_3()` exactly `rows_number` times.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are provided, and the function does not take any arguments.

The `processing` list and `rank` list remain unchanged except for the temporary modifications within the loop.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the value of `rank[da - 1]`, which is `tmp + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` processes a dictionary `d` and modifies a `processing` list based on the values in `d`. If the length of `d[da]` is 1, it returns 1 immediately. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the minimum value of a temporary variable `tmp` by setting elements in the `processing` list to 1 and checking the results. Finally, it updates the `rank` list with `tmp + 1` and returns this updated value.

    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns y, x - a // b * y, and g, where x, y, and g are the results of the function call func_13(b, a % b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers with `b` being greater than 0 and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b` being 1. Depending on the value of `b`, it either directly returns `x` as 1, `y` as 0, and `a` unchanged (with `b` becoming 0), or it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b` to compute `x`, `y`, and `g`. Finally, it returns `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`. In both cases, the function ensures that the gcd of `a` and `b` remains 1.
