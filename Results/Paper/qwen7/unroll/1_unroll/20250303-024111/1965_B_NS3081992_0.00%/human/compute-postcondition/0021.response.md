Output State: **`lk` is the length of `bk`, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `bk`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2)], and `ans` now includes `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(k + 1)` appends the value of `k + 1` to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
