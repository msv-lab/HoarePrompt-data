Output State: **The program returns a space-separated string of integers based on the value of `k`. If `k` is 1, the list is [2, 3, 4, 8]. Otherwise, the list contains [1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2^(lk), 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^l], where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix).**

This output state describes the final result after executing the given Python code snippet. The exact string returned will depend on the value of `k` and its binary representation length (`lk`).
