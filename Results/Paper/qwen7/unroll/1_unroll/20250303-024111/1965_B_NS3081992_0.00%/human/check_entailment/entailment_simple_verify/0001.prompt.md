You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - No subsequence of `a` should have a sum equal to `k`.
   - For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there must be a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The sequence needs to cover all sums from 1 to `n` except `k`.
   - The sequence can be of maximum length 25.

3. **Review of Functions:**
   - Most functions defined in the code are not used in the final solution (`func_1` to `func_14`).
   - `func_15` is the main function that processes the input and outputs the result.

4. **Analysis of `func_15`:**
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_14` to generate the sequence.
   - `func_14` generates the sequence based on the values of `n` and `k`.

5. **Analysis of `func_14`:**
   - Converts `n` to its binary representation.
   - If `k` is 1, it handles a special case.
   - Otherwise, it constructs the sequence by:
     - Adding powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
     - Adjusting the sequence to ensure no subsequence sums to `k`.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_14`:
- **Case `k == 1`:**
  - If `n == 2`, the sequence is `[2]`.
  - Otherwise, the sequence is `[2, 3, 2^i for i in range(2, l)]`.
  - This ensures that no subsequence sums to 1 and covers all sums up to `n`.

- **Case `k > 1`:**
  - Constructs the sequence by adding powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
  - Adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure no subsequence sums to `k`.
  - Adds `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to further ensure no subsequence sums to `k`.
  - Completes the sequence with additional powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

### Verification:
- The logic in `func_14` ensures that:
  - No subsequence sums to `k`.
  - All sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) are covered by some subsequence.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
