#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, edges is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, and start is an integer representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves, and 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: `tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes, with each edge from the `edges` list added bidirectionally. The `n` variable remains an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, and the `start` variable remains an integer representing the starting node for the round.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 1 or dist2 % 2 == 1) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns 'Ron'
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree), and `start` (an integer representing the starting node for the round). It constructs a tree representation using the given edges, identifies the two leaves of the tree, calculates the shortest distances from the starting node to each leaf using breadth-first search (BFS), and returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on whether these distances are odd or even. If both distances are odd, it returns 'Ron'; otherwise, it returns 'Hermione'.
