Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing a tuple (`start`, 0), `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `tree` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring nodes, `visited` is a set containing the element `start`.**

The code initializes a set called `visited` and adds the starting node (`start`) to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
