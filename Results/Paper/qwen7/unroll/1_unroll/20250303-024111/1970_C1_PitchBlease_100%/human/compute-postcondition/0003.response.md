Output State: `tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes, with each edge from the `edges` list added bidirectionally. The `n` variable remains an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, and the `start` variable remains an integer representing the starting node for the round.
