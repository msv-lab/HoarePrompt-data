Postcondition: **`tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes, `leaves` is a list of nodes that have exactly one adjacent node (i.e., leaf nodes), the `n` variable remains an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, the `start` variable remains an integer representing the starting node for the round, `dist1` is the distance from the starting node to the first leaf node using BFS, `dist2` is the distance from the starting node to the second leaf node using BFS, and both `dist1` and `dist2` are even numbers**
