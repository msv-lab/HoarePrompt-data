Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider the case where `m` is odd and `n` is even, or vice versa. According to the problem description, the only constraints are that `n` is the total number of moves and `m` is the final number of cubes in the tower. The program incorrectly prints "No" in these scenarios, which do not violate the rules of the game.

For example, consider the case where `n = 4` and `m = 3`. Here, Nikita can perform the following sequence of moves: add, add, remove, add. This results in a tower with 3 cubes after 4 moves. However, the program would incorrectly print "No" in this case because it checks `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` and `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0` conditions separately without considering the overall parity and total moves.
