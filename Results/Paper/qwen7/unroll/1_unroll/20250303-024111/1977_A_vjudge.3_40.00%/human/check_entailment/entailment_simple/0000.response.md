### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is correct.

2. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `n` and `m` are correctly initialized as integers from the input for each test case. This is correct.

3. **Conditions for Output**:
   - If `n == m`, the program prints "Yes". This condition is correctly checked.
   - If `m > n`, the program prints "No". This condition is also correctly checked.
   - If `m == n - 1`, the program prints "Yes". This condition is correctly checked.
   - If both `n` and `m` are even, the program prints "Yes". This condition is correctly checked.
   - If both `n` and `m` are odd, the program prints "Yes". This condition is correctly checked.
   - For all other cases, the program prints "No". This condition is correctly checked.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where `n` is zero or `m` is zero explicitly, but these cases do not affect the logic since `n` and `m` are always within the specified bounds (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The conditions cover all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
