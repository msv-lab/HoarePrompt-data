Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n, representing the trace of the string. The function returns a result based on the given parameters.**
