Output State: The output state is a series of characters where each character is determined by the count of the current element in the reversed array within the original array. Specifically, for each element in the reversed array, the corresponding character in the alphabet list (`alp`) is chosen based on the count of that element in the original array minus one. The result is printed as a concatenated string for each test case after processing all elements in the array.
