### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the field.
   - It initializes dictionaries to store the positions of players and goals.
   - It correctly identifies the initial positions of the Quaffle and the Bludger.
   - The program initializes the middle of the field and the initial state of the Quaffle.

2. **Movement and Action Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles player movements and updates their positions.
   - It checks for collisions with the Bludger and eliminates the player if they are in the same position.
   - The program correctly updates the Quaffle's position when a player moves with it.
   - It correctly handles the catching of the Quaffle and throwing it into a goal.

3. **Scoring and Elimination**:
   - The program correctly identifies when a player scores a goal and prints the appropriate message.
   - It correctly handles the elimination of players and updates the Quaffle's position accordingly.
   - The program sorts the eliminated players alphabetically before printing them.

4. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the final score and prints it in the required format.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the new position of an entity given a direction.

However, upon closer inspection, there are some issues with the implementation that need to be addressed:

- **Incorrect Function `func_1`**:
  - The function `func_1` is supposed to return the new position of an entity given a direction. However, the function is incorrectly implemented. Instead of returning a tuple containing the updated coordinates, it returns the sum of the first row of the 2D list `a` and the first element of `b`, and the sum of the second row of the 2D list `a` and the second element of `b`. This is incorrect because `a` is a dictionary and not a 2D list, and `b` is a direction, not indices.

- **Incorrect Handling of Bludger Collisions**:
  - When a player collides with a Bludger, the player is eliminated, but the Quaffle is not handled correctly. The Quaffle should remain at the position where the player and Bludger were, but the code does not update the Quaffle's position in this case.

- **Incorrect Handling of Player Elimination**:
  - The code correctly prints the eliminated players, but it does not handle the case where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle. The Quaffle should remain at the position where the player and Bludger were, but the code does not update the Quaffle's position in this case.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate due to the following reasons:
- The function `func_1` is incorrectly implemented.
- The handling of Bludger collisions and player eliminations is incomplete.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
