Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**: 
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to update the position of an entity on the field based on the direction specified. However, the implementation provided in the annotated program is incorrect. The function should take a position `(x, y)` and a direction `(dx, dy)` and return the new position `(x + dx, y + dy)`. Instead, the provided function sums the first row of the 2D list `a` with `dx` and the second row of the 2D list `a` with `dy`, which is not relevant to the problem context and will lead to incorrect results.

2. **Field Representation and Movement**:
   - The field is represented correctly using a 2D list `a`, and the movements are handled appropriately using the `mouvements` dictionary. The logic for moving players and the Quaffle is correct, and the conditions for eliminating players due to collision with Bludgers are also handled correctly.

3. **Scoring Logic**:
   - The scoring logic is implemented correctly. When a player scores in the opponent's goal, the corresponding team's score is incremented, and the appropriate message is printed. The Quaffle is reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

4. **Elimination Logic**:
   - The elimination logic is also implemented correctly. When a player collides with a Bludger, the player is eliminated, and the appropriate message is printed. The remaining players are updated accordingly.

5. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The final score is calculated and printed correctly after the game ends.

Given the above points, the primary issue lies in the implementation of the `func_1` function, which is incorrectly defined. However, the rest of the logic in the program is correct and would work as intended if `func_1` were implemented correctly.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, the `func_1` function should be corrected to properly handle the movement of entities on the field. Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(position, direction):
    x, y = position
    dx, dy = direction
    return x + dx, y + dy
```

With this correction, the program should work as intended.
