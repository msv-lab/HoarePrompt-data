The function processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), and a list of \( x \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \). It calculates a value \( ans \) based on the given conditions and prints the minimum of \( ans \) and \( n-2 \). After processing all test cases, it outputs the results.
