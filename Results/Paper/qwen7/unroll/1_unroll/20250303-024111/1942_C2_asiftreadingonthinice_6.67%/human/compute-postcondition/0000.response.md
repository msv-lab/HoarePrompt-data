Output State: **`tt` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4; all other variables retain their initial conditions.**

This means that `tt` is now set to the integer value entered by the user, which falls within the range of 1 to 10^4. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices remain undefined until further input is provided for each test case.
