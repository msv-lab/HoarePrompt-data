Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers n, x, and y where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. It then reads x distinct integers from 1 to n and returns different outputs based on the conditions provided.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing specific integers n, x, and y, along with x distinct integers representing vertices. The function does not return a single value but handles each test case independently according to the given constraints and input format.
