Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements. Specifically, the function `func_1` and the overall approach do not ensure that the array is filled with the smallest possible values that maximize the sum while adhering to the MEX constraint.

For instance, consider the input:
```
3
1 3 9
```

The expected output is:
```
13 0
```

However, the provided solution might not handle this case correctly. The function `func_1` and the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` do not ensure that the array is filled with the smallest possible values that maximize the sum. In this case, the array remains `[1, 3, 9]`, which is already the optimal configuration, but the program might still perform unnecessary operations.

To verify, let's consider another example:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```

The expected output is:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```

The program should fill the subarray from index 3 to 3 with the value 2 and then fill the subarray from index 3 to 4 with the value 2. However, the provided solution might not correctly identify these operations.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
