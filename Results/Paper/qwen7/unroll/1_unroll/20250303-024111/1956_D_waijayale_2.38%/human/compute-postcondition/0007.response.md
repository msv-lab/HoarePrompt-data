Functionality: **The function reads a list of integers `a` of length `n` (where `1 <= n <= 18`) and calls another function `func_2` to compute the sum `s` of the elements in `a`, the maximum value `m` in `a`, and a list `ops` of operations. It then prints the sum `s` and the maximum value `m`, followed by the indices `(l+1, r+1)` for each operation in `ops`. The function does not return any value.**
