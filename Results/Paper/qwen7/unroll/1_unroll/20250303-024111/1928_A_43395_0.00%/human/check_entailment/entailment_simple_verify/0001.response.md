### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaws in the given program. Let's break down the issues and verify the logic step by step using the annotated code and the problem description.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:

1. **Incorrect Conditions for "Yes":**
   - The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` is correct because if both dimensions are even, you can always cut the rectangle into smaller even-sized rectangles and rearrange them to form another rectangle.
   - The condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` is incorrect. This condition checks if `a` and `b` are equal, but it is not sufficient to determine if another rectangle can be formed. For example, a 3x2 rectangle can be cut into 3x1 rectangles and rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, even though `a` and `b` are not equal.
   - The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is incorrect because it always evaluates to true (since `(a - b) % 2` will never be exactly 0 unless `a == b`). This means it incorrectly marks all cases where `a != b` as 'yes', which is not always correct.

2. **Conditions for "No":**
   - The program incorrectly handles the remaining cases. It should handle cases where at least one dimension is 1, and check if the other dimension can be split into smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. However, the current logic does not correctly implement this.

#### Correct Logic:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
- If either `a` or `b` is 1, the rectangle cannot be split further into smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are greater than 1, the rectangle can always be split into smaller rectangles and rearranged to form a new rectangle, except when `a == b`.

#### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1 and b == 1:
            print('No')
        elif a == b:
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')

func()
```

### Final Evaluation:
The revised logic correctly identifies the cases where no new rectangle can be formed:
- If both dimensions are 1, the rectangle cannot be split further.
- If the dimensions are equal, the rectangle cannot be split into smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle.
- In all other cases, a new rectangle can be formed.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the given program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
