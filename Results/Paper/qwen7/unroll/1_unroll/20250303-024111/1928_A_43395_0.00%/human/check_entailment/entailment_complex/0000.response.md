Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**: 
   - The program correctly identifies that if both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, it should print 'yes', as Bob can always cut the rectangle into smaller even-sized rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - The condition `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is incorrectly written and should be checked directly without the tuple assignment. It should check if the absolute difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is equal to the minimum of \(a\) and \(b\), which would mean one dimension is exactly double the other, leading to no possible rearrangement into a different rectangle.
   - The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is redundant since the modulus operation will always return an integer, and the condition will always evaluate to true. This part of the code should be removed.
   - The final else statement is unnecessary and should be replaced with the correct logic.

2. **Correct Logic**:
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, print 'yes'.
   - If the absolute difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is equal to the minimum of \(a\) and \(b\), print 'no'.
   - Otherwise, print 'yes'.

3. **Given Code**:
   ```python
   def func():
       for i in range(int(input())):
           a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
           
           if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
               print('yes')
           elif abs(a - b) == min(a, b):
               print('no')
           else:
               print('yes')
   ```

Based on the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the condition checking for the absolute difference being equal to the minimum of \(a\) and \(b\) is incorrectly implemented.

Correctness: **False**
