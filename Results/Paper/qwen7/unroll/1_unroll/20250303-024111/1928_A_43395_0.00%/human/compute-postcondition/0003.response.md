Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it does not return a specific value but rather processes the input values `t`, `a`, and `b` according to some unspecified logic.**

Note: The exact logic for processing `t`, `a`, and `b` is not detailed in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the input constraints and the fact that the function processes these inputs without specifying the outcome of the processing.
