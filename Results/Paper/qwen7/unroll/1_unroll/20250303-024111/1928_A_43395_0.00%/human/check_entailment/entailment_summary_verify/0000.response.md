Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Loop through Test Cases**:
   ```python
   for i in range(int(input())):
       (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
   ```
   This part correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Conditions and Outputs**:
   ```python
   if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
       print('yes')
   elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
       print('no')
   elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
       print('yes')
   else:
       print('no')
   ```

   Let's break down each condition:
   - **Condition 1**: `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`
     - This checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are even. According to the problem, if both dimensions are even, we can always form another rectangle by cutting them into smaller even-sized rectangles and recombining them. This condition is correct.
   - **Condition 2**: `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`
     - This condition is incorrect. It checks if the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) equals \(-a\) or \(-b\), which doesn't make sense in the context of forming another rectangle.
   - **Condition 3**: `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`
     - This condition is also incorrect. It checks if the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd, which doesn't help in determining if another rectangle can be formed.
   - **Default Condition**: `else: print('no')`
     - This condition is used when none of the above conditions are met, and it prints 'no'.

### Correct Approach

To correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle, we need to check if either dimension is divisible by the other. This ensures that the rectangle can be split and recombined into another valid rectangle.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a % b == 0 or b % a == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Evaluation

Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the flawed conditions. The corrected program checks if either dimension is divisible by the other, which correctly determines if another rectangle can be formed.

Final: **False**
