Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the cost of bribing multiple people between Kirill's current position and his desired position. 

Consider the following test case:

```
3 2
4 3 2
2 3 1
```

- For the first person (position 0), the cost to bribe them is 4.
- For the second person (position 1), the cost to bribe them is 3.
- For the third person (position 2), the cost to bribe them is 2.

The program logic incorrectly accumulates costs without properly considering the cumulative effect of bribing multiple people. It should consider the total cost of bribing all intermediate people, but the current implementation only considers the cost of the last person bribed.

A correct approach would involve maintaining a running total of the minimum cost to reach each position and ensuring that the total cost is minimized when moving to a position within the first `m` positions. The current implementation fails to do this, leading to incorrect results.
