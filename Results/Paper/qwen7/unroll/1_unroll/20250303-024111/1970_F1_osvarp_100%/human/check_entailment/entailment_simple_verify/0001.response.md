### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly initializes the grid, reads the input, and populates the necessary data structures such as `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, and `points`.
   - The grid is parsed correctly, and the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle are stored in the `elements` dictionary.

2. **Action Processing:**
   - The function processes each action in the game. It correctly handles movement, catching, and throwing actions.
     - **Movement (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`):**
       - The function updates the position of the player in the `elements` dictionary correctly.
     - **Catching (`C`):**
       - The function correctly updates the state of the player and prints the appropriate message.
     - **Throwing (`T`):**
       - The function correctly updates the state of the player and checks if the Quaffle is placed in a goal, updating the score accordingly.
         - However, there is a critical issue in the handling of the throwing action. When a player throws the Quaffle, the Quaffle should be placed at the current position of the player, but the code does not update the Quaffle's position in the `grid`. This means the Quaffle's position remains unchanged, leading to potential incorrect scoring.
   - **Goal Checking:**
     - The function `goalIn` correctly identifies whether a given position is in a goal for either team.
   - **isPlayer:**
     - The function `isPlayer` correctly identifies whether a given element is a player.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the correct messages for scoring and elimination.
   - The final score is printed correctly after processing all actions, but due to the issue with the throwing action, the score might be incorrect.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided code and the problem description, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for processing the game actions and determining the score. However, there is a critical issue with the handling of the throwing action, which leads to incorrect scoring. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
