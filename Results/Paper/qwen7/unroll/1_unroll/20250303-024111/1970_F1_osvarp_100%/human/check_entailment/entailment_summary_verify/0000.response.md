### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function Summaries:
1. **`isPlayer(el)`**: Checks if the entity `el` is a player by verifying if it starts with 'B' or 'R' and does not end with 'G'.
2. **`goalIn(pos)`**: Determines which team's goal a position belongs to by checking if the position is in the list of goals for the red or blue team.

#### Key Points to Evaluate:
1. **Scoring Logic**: The program should correctly handle the scoring when a player scores in their own goal, resulting in the opposing team scoring a point.
2. **Action Handling**: The program should correctly handle player movements, catching, and throwing the Quaffle.

#### Analysis:
1. **Scoring Logic**:
   - The `goalIn(pos)` function correctly identifies which team's goal a position belongs to.
   - The `print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))` statement is used to print the scoring event, where `team` is determined by `goalIn(pos)`.
   - The `points[team] += 1` statement updates the score for the correct team.
   
2. **Handling Own Goal**:
   - The `goalIn(pos)` function returns `-1` if the position is not in any goal, `0` if it is a red goal, and `1` if it is a blue goal.
   - When a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, the `goalIn(pos)` function will return `-1`, indicating that the position is not a goal. However, the program does not explicitly handle the case where a player scores in their own goal.

Given the function summaries and the logic in the program, the program does not explicitly check if a player has scored in their own goal. However, the logic for scoring and updating the points is correctly implemented. The original assessment suggests that the program does not handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal, but upon closer inspection, the program does handle this correctly through the `goalIn(pos)` function.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the program does correctly handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal. The `goalIn(pos)` function ensures that the correct team scores a point when a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
