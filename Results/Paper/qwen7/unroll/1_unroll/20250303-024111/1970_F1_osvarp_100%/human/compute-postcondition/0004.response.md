Functionality: The function `goalIn` accepts a parameter `pos`, which is a string representing a position on the field ('RG' or 'BG'), and a parameter `goal`, which is a list of two sets containing the positions of the goals for the red and blue teams respectively. It checks whether `pos` is in the set of red team goals (`goal[0]`) or the set of blue team goals (`goal[1]`). If `pos` is in the set of red team goals, it returns 0; if `pos` is in the set of blue team goals, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.
