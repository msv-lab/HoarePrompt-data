Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues:

1. **Initialization of `cnt_b`**: The array `cnt_b` is initialized with a fixed size of `max_val + 1` (where `max_val = 1000000`). This is unnecessarily large and could lead to memory issues if the actual values in `b` are much smaller than this limit. It should be dynamically sized based on the maximum value present in `b`.

2. **Counting Matches**: The logic for counting matches in the sliding window is flawed. Specifically, when shifting the window, the code does not correctly update the count of elements in the current window. The decrement and increment operations should be adjusted to ensure the counts are accurate.

3. **Set Usage**: The use of `set(b)` to track `b_values` is unnecessary and inefficient. Instead, you can directly check membership in the list `b`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    from collections import Counter

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Count occurrences of elements in b
        cnt_b = Counter(b)

        ans = 0
        curr = 0

        # Initialize the first window
        for i in range(m):
            if a[i] in cnt_b:
                curr += 1
                cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1

        if curr >= k:
            ans += 1

        # Slide the window across the array
        for i in range(n - m):
            if a[i] in cnt_b:
                cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] <= 0:
                    curr -= 1
            if a[i + m] in cnt_b:
                cnt_b[a[i + m]] += 1
                if cnt_b[a[i + m]] <= 0:
                    curr += 1

            if curr >= k:
                ans += 1

        print(ans)
```

This corrected version properly handles the sliding window and updates the counts accurately.
