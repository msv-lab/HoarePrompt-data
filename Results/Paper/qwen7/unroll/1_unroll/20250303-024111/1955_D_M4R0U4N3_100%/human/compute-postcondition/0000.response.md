Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, max_val is 1000000**.

Explanation: The code sets the variable `max_val` to the integer `1000000`. This assignment does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the only change is that `max_val` is now explicitly set to `1000000`.
