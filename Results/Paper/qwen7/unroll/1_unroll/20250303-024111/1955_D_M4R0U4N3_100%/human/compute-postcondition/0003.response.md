Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros.

Explanation: The loop processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it updates the `cnt_b` list based on the input values but resets `cnt_b` to a list of 1000001 zeros after processing each test case. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, the `cnt_b` list remains unchanged as a list of 1000001 zeros.
