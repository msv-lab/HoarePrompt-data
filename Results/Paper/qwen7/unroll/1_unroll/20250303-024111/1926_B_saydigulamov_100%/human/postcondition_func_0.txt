The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of '0's and '1's. For each test case, it checks if the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, with the size of the shape being greater than 1. Based on the configuration of '1's, it prints either 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
