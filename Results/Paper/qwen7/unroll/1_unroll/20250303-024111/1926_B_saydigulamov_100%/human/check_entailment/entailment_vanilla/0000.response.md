### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to determine whether the grid contains a square or a triangle.
   - A square consists of `k` consecutive rows, each having `k` consecutive `1`s positioned equally from the left edge.
   - A triangle consists of `k` consecutive rows, where the `i`-th row has `2*i - 1` consecutive `1`s centered in one column.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`a`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid (`n`) and then reads `n` lines of the grid.
   - It counts the number of `1`s in each row and stores these counts in the list `k`.
   - If all counts in `k` are the same, it prints "SQUARE".
   - Otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - **Square Check**: For a square, all rows should have the same number of `1`s. This logic is correct.
   - **Triangle Check**: The program does not check for the triangle condition. It only checks if all rows have the same number of `1`s, which is insufficient to determine a triangle.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the following grid:
     ```
     000
     011
     011
     ```
     - The counts of `1`s in each row are `[0, 2, 2]`. Since they are not all the same, the program correctly identifies this as a triangle.
   - Consider the following grid:
     ```
     0000
     0000
     0100
     1110
     ```
     - The counts of `1`s in each row are `[0, 0, 2, 3]`. Since they are not all the same, the program correctly identifies this as a triangle.
   - Consider the following grid:
     ```
     00111
     00010
     00000
     00000
     00000
     ```
     - The counts of `1`s in each row are `[3, 1, 0, 0, 0]`. Since they are not all the same, the program correctly identifies this as a triangle.
   - Consider the following grid:
     ```
     1111111110
     0111111100
     0011111000
     0001110000
     0000100000
     ```
     - The counts of `1`s in each row are `[9, 8, 7, 6, 1]`. Since they are not all the same, the program correctly identifies this as a triangle.
   - Consider the following grid:
     ```
     111
     111
     111
     ```
     - The counts of `1`s in each row are `[3, 3, 3]`. Since they are all the same, the program correctly identifies this as a square.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly identifies squares and triangles based on the number of `1`s in each row. However, it does not check for the specific pattern required for a triangle (centered `1`s).

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the program correctly identifies squares and triangles based on the number of `1`s in each row but does not fully implement the triangle detection logic. Therefore, the program is **not** fully correct as per the problem statement.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**
