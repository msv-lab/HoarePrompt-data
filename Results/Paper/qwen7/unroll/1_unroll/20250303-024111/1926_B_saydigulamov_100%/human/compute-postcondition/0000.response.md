Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is the integer input followed by the number of test cases.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. This input represents the number of test cases (`t`). The initial values of `t` and the conditions for `n` and the grid structure remain unchanged but are now known to be part of the input for the subsequent test cases.
