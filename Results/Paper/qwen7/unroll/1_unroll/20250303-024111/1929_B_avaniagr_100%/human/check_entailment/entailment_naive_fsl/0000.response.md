Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where `k` is exactly `4 * n - 3`. According to the problem description, when `k` is `4 * n - 3`, the minimum number of cells that need to be colored is `2 * n - 1`. However, the program prints `2 * n` in this case, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input `(n, k) = (3, 9)`. The correct output should be `6` because we need to color `6` cells to ensure that all `9` diagonals have at least one colored cell. However, the program incorrectly outputs `6` for this case, but it also incorrectly outputs `6` for other cases where `k` is not `4 * n - 3`.

To fix this, the program needs to specifically handle the case where `k` is `4 * n - 3` by printing `2 * n - 1` instead of `2 * n`.
