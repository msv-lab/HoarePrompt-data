Output State: The output state consists of a series of lines, each containing an integer result based on the value of `k` relative to `n`. For each test case, if `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, the output is `math.ceil(k / 2)`. If `k` equals `4 * n - 3`, the output is `2 * n - 1`. If `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, the output is `2 * n`. The number of lines in the output state is equal to the number of test cases provided in the input.
