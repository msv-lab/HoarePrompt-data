Output State: The output state consists of a series of integers printed based on the conditions provided within the loop. For each test case, if \( k \leq 4n - 4 \), the output is \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\). If \( k = 4n - 3 \), the output is \(2n - 1\). If \( k = 4n - 2 \), the output is \(2n\). The specific sequence of these integers depends on the input values of \(n\) and \(k\) for each test case.
