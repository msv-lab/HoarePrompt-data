Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (number of test cases) and a string `s` (of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters). For each test case, it checks if the number of unique characters in `s` is 2. If true, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by either the lexicographically sorted version or the reverse sorted version of `s`, whichever comes first.**
