The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value \( y \) based on the given conditions involving \( n \) and \( k \). If \( k \) is greater than half of \( n + 1 \), it computes \( y \) using a specific formula involving binary operations and arithmetic. Otherwise, it simply prints \( 2k - 1 \).
