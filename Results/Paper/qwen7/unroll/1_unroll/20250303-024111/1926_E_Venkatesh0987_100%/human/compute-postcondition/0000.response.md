Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will run.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: The problem statement mentions that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\). This means that `t` represents the number of test cases, and this value will be used as the input to the `range` function.

3. **Understand the loop execution condition**: The loop will execute as long as the input value (which is `t`) is a positive integer. Since `t` is given as an integer in the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute if `t` is within this range.

4. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set `t` to a value within the specified range. Since the loop will run based on the input from `input()`, we need to ensure that the input value is valid.

Given these points, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `t` is a valid integer within the specified range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\)**
