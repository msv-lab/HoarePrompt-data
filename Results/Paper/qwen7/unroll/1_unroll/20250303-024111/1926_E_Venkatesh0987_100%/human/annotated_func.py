    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. After all the loop executions, the value of `y` is printed for each test case based on the conditions given in the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value \( y \) based on the given conditions involving \( n \) and \( k \). If \( k \) is greater than half of \( n + 1 \), it computes \( y \) using a specific formula involving binary operations and arithmetic. Otherwise, it simply prints \( 2k - 1 \).
