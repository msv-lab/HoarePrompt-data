Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case separately.
2. It initializes necessary variables and data structures, including prefix XOR arrays and a dictionary to store the positions of prefix XOR values.
3. For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray from index `l` to `r-1` using the prefix XOR values.
4. It checks if the XOR value is zero, which directly indicates the subarray is interesting.
5. If the XOR value is non-zero, it uses binary search (`bisect.bisect_left`) to find potential split points that could make the subarray interesting.
6. The logic for checking split points ensures that the subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR values.
7. The final output is formatted correctly, printing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query and separating them with newlines.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem's requirements accurately and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
