Output State: **`t` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `data`, or `idx`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and a new variable `results` is introduced as an empty list.
