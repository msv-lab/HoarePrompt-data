Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the solution for determining if a subarray is interesting based on the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and then processes it, which is efficient for handling large inputs.
2. **Data Structures**: It uses prefix XOR arrays (`pf`) and a dictionary (`mp`) to store indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
3. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: It calculates the prefix XOR values for the array and stores them in `pf`.
4. **Query Processing**: For each query, it calculates the XOR value for the subarray and checks if this value can be achieved by splitting the subarray into two or more parts with equal XOR values.
5. **Binary Search**: It uses binary search (`bisect.bisect_left`) to find relevant indices in the dictionary, ensuring efficient checking of conditions.
6. **Output**: The program correctly formats and prints the results for each query.

Given the structure and logic of the program, it accurately solves the problem as described.
