Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop execution directly. We can ignore it.
   - The variable `t` is an integer value from `data[idx]`.
   - The variable `idx` is initially set to 1.
   - The variable `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
   - The variable `results` is an empty list.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `t` is derived from `data[idx]` and `idx` is 1, we need to ensure that `data[1]` is a positive integer. If `data[1]` is not a positive integer, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `data[1]` must be a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`data[1]` must be a positive integer, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
