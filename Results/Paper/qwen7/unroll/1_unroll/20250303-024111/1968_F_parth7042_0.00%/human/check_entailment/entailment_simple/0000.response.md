Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates through the test cases, parsing `n`, `q`, and the array `a` for each test case.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The prefix XOR array `pf` is calculated correctly, which helps in determining the XOR of any subarray efficiently using the property `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]` giving the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]`.

3. **Mapping XOR Values to Indices**: The program maintains a mapping `mp` where keys are XOR values and values are lists of indices where these XOR values occur. This is used to quickly find potential split points for the subarray.

4. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program calculates the required XOR value (`x`) for the subarray and checks if there exist indices that can form valid splits. The use of binary search (`bisect_left`) ensures efficient checking of the existence of such indices.

5. **Output Generation**: The results are stored in a list `results` and finally printed as a single string with each result separated by a newline.

Given the detailed steps and the correctness of the logic implemented, the annotated program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
