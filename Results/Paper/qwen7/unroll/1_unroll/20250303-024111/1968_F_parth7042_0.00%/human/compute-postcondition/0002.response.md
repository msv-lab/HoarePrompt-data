Output State: **`t` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is 0**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t` by converting the string at index `idx` of the list `data` into an integer. The value of `idx` remains unchanged, and the list `data` and its content also remain unchanged.
