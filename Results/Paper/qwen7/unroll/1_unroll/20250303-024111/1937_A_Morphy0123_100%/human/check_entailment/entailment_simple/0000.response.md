Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the position of the number 1 in the array after performing a series of swap operations.
2. The provided solution does not correctly implement the required logic for the swap operations. Instead, it attempts to determine the next power of 2 for the input `n` and prints it, which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.
3. The solution does not involve any swapping of elements in the array as specified in the problem statement.
4. The solution does not handle the array initialization or the swap operations as described in the problem.

Given these points, the provided code does not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
