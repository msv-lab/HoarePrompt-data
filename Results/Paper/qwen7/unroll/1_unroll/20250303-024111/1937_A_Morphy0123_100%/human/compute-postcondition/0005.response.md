Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). For each `n`, if `n` is 1, it prints 1. If `n` is a power of 2, it prints the next power of 2. Otherwise, it prints the highest power of 2 less than `n`. The function reads the number of test cases from user input and repeats the above process for each test case. After processing all test cases, it concludes without returning any value.**
