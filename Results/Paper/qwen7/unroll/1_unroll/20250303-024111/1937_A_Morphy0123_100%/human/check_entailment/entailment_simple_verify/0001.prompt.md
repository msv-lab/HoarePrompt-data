You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:

            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of numbers printed based on the input values for each case. For each input `n`, if `n` is 1, it will print 1. If `n` is a power of 2, it will print the next power of 2. Otherwise, it will print the current highest power of 2 less than `n`. The number of outputs will be equal to the value of `n_cases`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Initial Array**: The array starts with `a[i] = i` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.
2. **Swap Operation**: For each `i` from 2 to `n`, we need to swap `a[d]` and `a[i]` where `d` is the largest proper divisor of `i`.
3. **Objective**: Find the position of `1` in the array after performing all swaps.

### Program Analysis
The given program attempts to solve the problem using logarithmic calculations, which does not align with the actual requirements of the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   
2. **Single Test Case Handling**:
   - If `n == 1`, it prints `1` immediately, which is correct since the array is `[1]` and no swaps are needed.
   - For `n > 1`, it uses `log2(n)` to calculate something, but this is not relevant to finding the largest proper divisor.

3. **Finding Largest Proper Divisor**:
   - The program does not actually find the largest proper divisor of `i` and perform the swap. Instead, it calculates powers of 2, which is unrelated to the problem.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we should:
1. Identify the largest proper divisor of each `i` from 2 to `n`.
2. Perform the swap operation accordingly.
3. Track the position of `1` after all swaps.

### Correct Solution
Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_largest_proper_divisor(k):
    for d in range(k // 2, 0, -1):
        if k % d == 0:
            return d
    return 1  # This should never happen for k > 1

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            position_of_one = 1
            for i in range(2, n + 1):
                d = find_largest_proper_divisor(i)
                a_d = position_of_one
                position_of_one = i
                a_i = d
                # Swap positions
                if a_d != a_i:
                    position_of_one = d
            print(position_of_one)

func()
```
