Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the percentage of satisfied residents on each side of the road. Specifically, the program uses `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` to calculate the percentages, which is incorrect because it does not account for rounding up as required by the problem description.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
011
```

The program will output `2`, but the correct output should be `1`. Hereâ€™s why:

- If the road is laid after the first house, there will be 1 house on the left (`0`) and 2 houses on the right (`11`). 
  - Left side: 1 out of 1 resident is satisfied (100%).
  - Right side: 2 out of 2 residents are satisfied (100%).

- If the road is laid after the second house, there will be 2 houses on the left (`01`) and 1 house on the right (`1`).
  - Left side: 1 out of 2 residents is satisfied (50%).
  - Right side: 1 out of 1 resident is satisfied (100%).

Since the left side does not meet the requirement of having at least 50% of residents satisfied, the road should be laid after the first house, which gives a valid solution.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the percentages and does not ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. This can be seen in the given test case, where the program fails to correctly determine the optimal position for the road.
