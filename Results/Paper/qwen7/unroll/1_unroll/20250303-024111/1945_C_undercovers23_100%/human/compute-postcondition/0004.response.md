Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \), an integer \( n \), and a binary string \( s \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the index of the first position in the string \( s \) where the percentage of zeros and ones is at least 50%. If no such position exists, it returns either 0 or \( n \) based on whether the overall percentage of ones in the string is at least 50%. The function prints the calculated index for each test case.**
