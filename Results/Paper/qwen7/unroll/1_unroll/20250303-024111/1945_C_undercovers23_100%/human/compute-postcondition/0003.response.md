Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a string a of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. For each test case, it returns information based on the values of t, n, and the string a.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters t, n, and a string a. It processes these parameters and returns output relevant to the given test case without accepting any parameters directly within its definition.
