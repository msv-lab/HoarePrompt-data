Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to implement the balanced shuffle operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence.
2. The provided code correctly implements the required steps:
   - It computes the balance and position for each character in the input sequence.
   - It sorts these balances and positions to form the new sequence.
   - It constructs and prints the resulting balanced shuffle sequence.
3. The `func_1` and `func_2` functions are not directly used in the main logic but are part of the provided code structure. However, they are not necessary for the implementation of the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.
4. The `BalanceInfo` class is correctly used to store the balance, position, and character information for each position in the input sequence.
5. The sorting key in `balance_info.sort()` is correctly set to sort by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order for equal balances, which aligns with the definition of the balanced shuffle operation.

Given the provided annotated program and the explanation of the logic, the implementation appears to be correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
