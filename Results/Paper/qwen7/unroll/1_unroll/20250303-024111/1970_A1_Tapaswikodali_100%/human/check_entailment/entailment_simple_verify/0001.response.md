### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to implement a function `func_2` that performs the "balanced shuffle" operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence. The balanced shuffle operation involves calculating the balance of each prefix, sorting based on this balance, and then reconstructing the sequence.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function is not used in the main logic but seems to be a helper function for sorting. It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position. However, the function name suggests it might be used elsewhere, but it is not referenced in the main logic.
   - **Function `func_2`**:
     - **Initialization**: 
       - `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
       - `balance_info` is initialized as an empty list to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
       - `balance` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the current balance.
     - **Building Balance Info**:
       - A loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
       - For each character, a `BalanceInfo` object is created and appended to `balance_info`.
       - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented; if it's ')', the balance is decremented.
     - **Sorting**:
       - `balance_info` is sorted using a lambda function that sorts based on the balance and position in descending order for tie-breaking. This is correct and aligns with the problem statement.
     - **Reconstructing the Result**:
       - The sorted `balance_info` is used to construct the result string by joining the characters from the `BalanceInfo` objects.
       - The result is printed.

3. **Validation**:
   - The code correctly calculates the balance of each prefix and stores it along with the position and character.
   - The sorting logic ensures that the sequence is sorted based on the specified criteria.
   - The reconstruction of the result sequence is done correctly by joining the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects.

However, there is one potential issue to consider:
- The lambda function used for sorting should prioritize non-negative balances first. The current implementation sorts by balance in ascending order and then by position in descending order for ties. This means that if two prefixes have the same balance, they will be sorted by position in descending order, which might not always produce the correct result. Specifically, if two prefixes have the same balance, the one with the higher position should come first, not the one with the lower position.

To ensure correctness, the lambda function should be adjusted to prioritize non-negative balances first and then by position in descending order for ties. Here is the corrected lambda function:

```python
balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance >= 0, -x.position))
```

This ensures that prefixes with non-negative balances are prioritized, and for those with the same balance, the one with the higher position comes first.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is almost correct, but the lambda function used for sorting needs a small adjustment to ensure that prefixes with non-negative balances are prioritized correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
