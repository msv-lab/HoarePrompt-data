### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to implement a function `func_2` that performs the "balanced shuffle" operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence. The balanced shuffle operation involves calculating the balance of each prefix, sorting based on this balance, and then reconstructing the sequence.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function is not used in the main logic but seems to be a helper function for sorting. It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position.
   - **Function `func_2`**:
     - **Initialization**: 
       - `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
       - `balance_info` is initialized as an empty list to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
       - `balance` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the current balance.
     - **Building Balance Info**:
       - A loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
       - For each character, a `BalanceInfo` object is created and appended to `balance_info`.
       - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented; if it's ')', the balance is decremented.
     - **Sorting**:
       - `balance_info` is sorted using a lambda function that sorts based on the balance and position in descending order for tie-breaking.
     - **Reconstructing the Result**:
       - The sorted `balance_info` is used to construct the result string by joining the characters from the `BalanceInfo` objects.
       - The result is printed.

3. **Validation**:
   - The code correctly calculates the balance of each prefix and stores it along with the position and character.
   - The sorting logic ensures that the sequence is sorted based on the specified criteria.
   - The reconstruction of the result sequence is done correctly by joining the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects.

However, there is a critical issue in the sorting step. The lambda function used for sorting should sort based on the balance in ascending order and then by position in descending order for tie-breaking. The current implementation sorts the balance in descending order, which will lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input `(()(()))`:
- The balance values are: 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3.
- The positions are: 1, 8, 4, 2, 7, 5, 3, 6.
- Sorting with the current lambda function would give: (3, 6), (2, 5), (2, 7), (1, 4), (1, 2), (1, 8), (0, 1).
- This would incorrectly reconstruct the sequence as `()(()())`.

To fix this, the lambda function should be updated to:
```python
balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
```
This ensures that the balance is sorted in ascending order and the positions are sorted in descending order for tie-breaking.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is almost correct, but the sorting logic needs to be adjusted to ensure the balance is sorted in ascending order and positions are sorted in descending order for tie-breaking.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
