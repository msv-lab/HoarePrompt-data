The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")", verifies that it forms a valid balanced parentheses sequence, and prints a new string where the characters from `s` are rearranged according to their balance value and position. Specifically, the characters are sorted first by their balance value in ascending order and then by their original positions in descending order among those with the same balance value.
