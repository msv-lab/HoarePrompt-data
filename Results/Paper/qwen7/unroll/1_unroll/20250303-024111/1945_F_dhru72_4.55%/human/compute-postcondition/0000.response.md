Output State: **`T` is a type variable, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `v` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9, and `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. Additionally, the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**

Explanation: The line `T = TypeVar('T')` defines a type variable named `T`, but it does not assign any specific value to any of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `v`, `p`). Therefore, the values and conditions of these variables remain unchanged.
