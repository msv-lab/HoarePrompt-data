State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is determined by the user input, and it is given that `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000.
- The variable `_` is a placeholder used in the `for` loop and is automatically incremented with each iteration. Initially, it is set to 0.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range.
- The variable `_` is not something we need to explicitly adjust because it is initialized to 0 and will be incremented during the loop iterations.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, and `_` starting at 0.
