### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided examples.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `4 * n - 2` equals `k`. This condition is used to handle a specific case where the number of diagonals `k` is exactly equal to the total number of diagonals in the grid.
   - If this condition is true, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`.

3. **Mathematical Justification**:
   - For a grid of size \( n \times n \), there are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.
   - Each colored cell can cover up to 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal).
   - To minimize the number of colored cells while ensuring at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell, we need to distribute the cells such that they cover the required diagonals.

4. **Special Case**:
   - When \( k = 4n - 2 \), every diagonal must have at least one colored cell. In this case, the minimum number of cells needed is \( \frac{4n - 2}{2} + 1 = 2n - 1 \). The `+1` accounts for the fact that some cells might cover both diagonals simultaneously.
   - The program correctly handles this special case by printing `k // 2 + 1`.

5. **General Case**:
   - For other values of \( k \), the minimum number of cells required is approximately \( \frac{k}{2} \), rounded up to ensure at least \( k \) diagonals are covered.
   - The program uses `ceil(k / 2)` to achieve this.

However, upon closer inspection, the program's logic does not fully account for the distribution of diagonals. Specifically, the program assumes that each cell covers exactly 2 diagonals, but this is not always the case. For example, in a \(3 \times 3\) grid, the diagonals are distributed as follows:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

The diagonals are:
- Main diagonals: 1, 5, 9 (3 diagonals)
- Anti-diagonals: 3, 5, 7 (3 diagonals)

To cover all 10 diagonals, we need to ensure that the cells are placed optimally. The program's approach of simply using `ceil(k / 2)` or `k // 2 + 1` may not always yield the minimum number of cells required.

#### Example Analysis

- **Test Case 1**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 4 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - Minimum cells needed: 2 (as shown in the example)
  - Program output: 2 (correct)

- **Test Case 2**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - Minimum cells needed: 2 (as shown in the example)
  - Program output: 2 (correct)

- **Test Case 3**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 10 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - Minimum cells needed: 6 (as shown in the example)
  - Program output: 6 (correct)

- **Test Case 4**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 9 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - Minimum cells needed: 5 (as shown in the example)
  - Program output: 5 (correct)

- **Test Case 5**: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 7 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 4 - 2 = 14 \)
  - Minimum cells needed: 4 (as shown in the example)
  - Program output: 4 (correct)

- **Test Case 6**: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 11 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 7 - 2 = 26 \)
  - Minimum cells needed: 6 (as shown in the example)
  - Program output: 6 (correct)

- **Test Case 7**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 2 - 2 = 6 \)
  - Minimum cells needed: 2 (as shown in the example)
  - Program output: 2 (correct)

Upon reviewing the examples, the program seems to produce the correct outputs for the given test cases. However, the logic does not guarantee the minimum number of cells in all scenarios due to the assumption that each cell covers exactly 2 diagonals.

### Conclusion

While the program produces the correct outputs for the given examples, it does not guarantee the minimum number of cells in all scenarios due to the assumption that each cell covers exactly 2 diagonals. Therefore, the original assessment is not entirely accurate.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
