### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal in an array by adding a permutation to the array.
   - A permutation is a rearrangement of the array indices such that each index maps to a unique index in the original array.

2. **Given Program Analysis:**
   - The program iterates over each test case using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It then removes duplicates from the array and sorts it.
   - It calculates the maximum value in the sorted array.
   - It then iterates through the sorted array and uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the position where the current element plus `n` would fit in the sorted array.
   - It calculates the difference between this position and the current index, which gives the count of elements that can be made equal to the current element after adding the permutation.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum count obtained.

3. **Key Points to Verify:**
   - The program should handle all possible test cases correctly.
   - The logic for finding the maximum number of equal elements should be accurate.
   - The use of `bisect_left` is appropriate for finding the insertion point in the sorted array.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - Removing duplicates and sorting the array ensures that we consider unique values and their frequencies.
   - Using `bisect_left` to find the insertion point is a valid approach to count the number of elements that can be made equal.
   - The logic for updating the maximum count is correct.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all the necessary steps and uses appropriate data structures and algorithms.

### Correctness:
**True**
