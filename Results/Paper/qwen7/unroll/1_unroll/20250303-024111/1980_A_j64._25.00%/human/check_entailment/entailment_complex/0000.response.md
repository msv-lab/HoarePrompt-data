Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly initializes the input parameters and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it calculates the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') using an array `freq`.
3. It then determines how many additional problems are needed for each difficulty level by comparing the required number of rounds (`m`) with the current frequency (`f`). If the frequency is less than `m`, the difference is added to the `missing` count.
4. The `missing` count for each test case is correctly calculated and appended to the `results` list.
5. The function returns the `results` list, which contains the minimum number of problems needed for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps outlined in the annotated program, the function appears to be correct and matches the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
