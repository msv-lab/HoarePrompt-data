Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three elements: `n` (an integer between 1 and 50), `m` (an integer between 1 and 5), and `a` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'). The function returns a list `results` containing the number of missing characters for each test case. For each test case, if the frequency of any character in the string `a` is less than `m`, the difference is added to the `missing` count, and this count is appended to the `results` list.**
