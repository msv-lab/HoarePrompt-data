Reasoning:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples containing the number of problems in the bank, the number of rounds, and the string of problem difficulties).

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The function iterates through each test case, extracting the necessary values (`n`, `m`, and `a`).

3. **Frequency Calculation**: It initializes a list `freq` of size 7 (corresponding to the difficulty levels 'A' to 'G') and increments the appropriate index for each character in the string `a`.

4. **Missing Problems Calculation**: For each difficulty level, it calculates how many more problems are needed by taking the maximum of 0 and `m - f` (where `f` is the frequency of the current difficulty level). This ensures that only difficulties that have fewer than `m` problems are considered.

5. **Summing Missing Problems**: The total number of missing problems is summed up and appended to the `results` list.

6. **Return Results**: Finally, the function returns the list of results.

Given the execution summary and the provided example, the program seems to correctly calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
