Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the possibility that the array might contain elements that cannot be reduced to zero through the specified operations. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the array `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`. According to the problem description, we need to check if it's possible to make all elements zero. However, the current implementation only checks the first and last elements for specific conditions and prints 'NO' if they do not meet those conditions. This approach is insufficient because it does not account for the entire array and the interactions between elements during the operations.

A correct solution would involve checking if the sum of the array is divisible by 3, as each operation reduces three consecutive elements by a total of 4. If the sum is not divisible by 3, it is impossible to make all elements zero. Additionally, the initial values of the first and last elements need to be checked more thoroughly to ensure they can be reduced to zero through valid operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is divisible by 3
        if sum(a) % 3 != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Check if the first and last elements can be reduced to zero
            if a[0] % 2 == 1 or a[-1] % 2 == 1:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles all potential cases correctly.
