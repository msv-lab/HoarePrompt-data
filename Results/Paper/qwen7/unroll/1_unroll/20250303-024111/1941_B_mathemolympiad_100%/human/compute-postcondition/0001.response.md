Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `numTest`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `numTest` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop depends on `numTest`, we need to ensure that `numTest` is greater than 0. The other variables (`_` and `a`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their initial states do not affect the loop execution.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `numTest` to ensure it is greater than 0.

**State:**
**`numTest` must be greater than 0**
