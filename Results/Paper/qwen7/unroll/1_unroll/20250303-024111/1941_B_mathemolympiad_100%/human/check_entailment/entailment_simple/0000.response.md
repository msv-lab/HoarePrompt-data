Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numTest`) and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`a`).
3. It then iterates through the array from index 0 to `n-3` (inclusive), applying the specified operation as long as the current element (`a[i]`) is non-negative.
4. During each iteration, it reduces the elements `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, and `a[i+2]` by `opNum`, `2*opNum`, and `opNum` respectively.
5. If at any point during this process, an element becomes negative, the program prints 'NO' and stops further processing for that test case.
6. After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
7. The logic ensures that the program only prints 'YES' if it's possible to make all elements zero by the described operations, and it correctly identifies cases where making all elements zero is impossible.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to implement the required logic correctly.

Correctness: **True**
