Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers `a` of length `n`, where `3 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5`. Each integer `a_j` in the list satisfies `0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9`. The sum of all integers in the list across all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`. The function returns a value based on the list `a`.**

This means the function takes an array of integers as input implicitly through some external mechanism (not shown in the provided code snippet) and processes it according to the given constraints. The function then returns a result based on the array `a`.
