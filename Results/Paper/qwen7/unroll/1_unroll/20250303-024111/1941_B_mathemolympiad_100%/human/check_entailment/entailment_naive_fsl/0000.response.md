Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. Specifically, the program only checks if any element becomes negative during the operations and stops immediately if it does. However, this approach is insufficient because it does not account for the possibility that negative elements might become zero through subsequent operations.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

The program's output for this input is "YES", but let's analyze whether this is correct according to the problem description.

1. Initial array: `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`
2. Apply the operation at `i=2`:
   - `a[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`
   - `a[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`
   - `a[3] = 5 - 1 = 4`
3. Apply the operation at `i=3`:
   - `a[2] = 1 - 1 = 0`
   - `a[3] = 4 - 2 = 2`
   - `a[4] = 2 - 1 = 1`
4. Apply the operation at `i=4`:
   - `a[3] = 2 - 1 = 1`
   - `a[4] = 1 - 2 = -1` (negative value)

Even though the initial check does not trigger an immediate "NO" response, the presence of a negative value indicates that the array cannot be made entirely zero because further operations would lead to more negative values, which cannot be corrected to zero.

Therefore, the program fails to handle this scenario correctly and should return "NO" for this input. Hence, the program is incorrect.
