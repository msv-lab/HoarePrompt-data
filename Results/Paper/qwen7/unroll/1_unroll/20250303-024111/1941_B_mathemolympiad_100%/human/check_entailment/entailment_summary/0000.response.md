Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and checking if any element becomes negative during the operations. However, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Operation Application**: The program subtracts `opNum` from `a[i]`, `2 * opNum` from `a[i+1]`, and `opNum` from `a[i+2]`. This is not the same as the described operation where `a[i-1]` should also be decreased by `1` when `a[i]` is decreased by `2`.

2. **Stopping Condition**: The program correctly stops and prints 'NO' if any element becomes negative. However, it continues to the next test case without resetting the array state, which might lead to incorrect results if the subsequent test cases depend on the modified array from the previous test case.

3. **Final Check**: The final check only considers the last two elements of the array. It should consider all elements to ensure they are zero.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
