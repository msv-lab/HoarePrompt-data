Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func()` correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
2. **Checking Parity**:
   - If either `a` or `b` is even, the function checks if splitting the rectangle into two equal halves results in a different rectangle.
   - Specifically, if `a` is even, it splits the rectangle into two rectangles of dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\).
   - Similarly, if `b` is even, it splits the rectangle into two rectangles of dimensions \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\).
3. **Validation**:
   - If the split dimensions do not match the original dimensions, it prints "Yes".
   - If the split dimensions match the original dimensions, it prints "No".
4. **Odd Dimensions**:
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, no valid split exists that results in a different rectangle, so it prints "No".

This logic aligns with the problem statement and examples provided. Therefore, the function is correct.
