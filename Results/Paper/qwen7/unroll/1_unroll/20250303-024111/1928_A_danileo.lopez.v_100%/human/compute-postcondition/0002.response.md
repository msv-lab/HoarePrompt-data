State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 0** 

Explanation:
- The variable `t` determines how many times the loop will run. It must be an integer within the specified range (1 to \(10^4\)) for the loop to execute.
- The variable `_` is a placeholder used as the loop variable in Python's `for` loop when you don't need to use the actual index value inside the loop. Before the loop starts, its value is set to 0 because the loop hasn't started yet.

Since the loop head only involves `t` and `_`, these are the only states that need adjustment.
