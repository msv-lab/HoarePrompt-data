The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers: `t`, `a`, and `b`. It checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If so, it further checks specific conditions involving division of `a` and `b` by 2. Based on these conditions, it prints 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs a series of 'Yes' or 'No' values corresponding to the given inputs.
