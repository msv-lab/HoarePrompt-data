Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.

2. **Even Dimensions Check**: The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If either dimension is even, it further checks if the halves can form a different rectangle:
   - If `a` is even, it splits `a` into two equal halves (`a1, a2 = a // 2, a // 2`) and checks if `a1` is not equal to `b`. If this condition is met, it prints "Yes".
   - Similarly, if `b` is even, it splits `b` into two equal halves (`b1, b2 = b // 2, b // 2`) and checks if `b1` is not equal to `a`. If this condition is met, it prints "Yes".

3. **Odd Dimensions Check**: If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program directly prints "No". This is correct because an odd-sized rectangle cannot be split into two smaller rectangles that can form a different rectangle when considering the constraints given.

4. **Output Consistency**: The program prints "Yes" if the conditions for forming a different rectangle are met and "No" otherwise. This matches the problem statement and the expected output format.

Given the above analysis, the program logic is consistent with the problem requirements and handles all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
