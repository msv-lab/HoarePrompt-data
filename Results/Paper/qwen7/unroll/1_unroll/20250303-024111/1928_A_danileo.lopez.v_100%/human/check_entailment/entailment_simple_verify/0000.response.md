### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            if a % 2 == 0:
                (a1, a2) = (a // 2, a // 2)
                if a1 != b:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            if b % 2 == 0:
                (b1, b2) = (b // 2, b // 2)
                if b1 != a:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            print('No')
        else:
            print('No')
```

#### Annotated Code:
The program iterates over `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If either is even, it attempts to split the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and checks if the resulting configuration allows forming another rectangle. If neither `a` nor `b` is even, it prints "No".

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where both `a` and `b` are odd but their sum is even, which should allow forming another rectangle. The suggested fix is to check if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Case When Either `a` or `b` is Even:**
   - If `a` is even, the program splits `a` into two equal parts (`a1` and `a2`) and checks if `a1` (or `a2`) is not equal to `b`. If `a1` (or `a2`) is not equal to `b`, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
   - Similarly, if `b` is even, the program splits `b` into two equal parts (`b1` and `b2`) and checks if `b1` (or `b2`) is not equal to `a`. If `b1` (or `b2`) is not equal to `a`, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
   - These checks are correct for the given logic.

2. **Case When Both `a` and `b` are Odd:**
   - The program currently prints "No" for this case, which is incorrect according to the problem statement. As mentioned, if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, it is possible to form another rectangle.
   - For example, a `3x5` rectangle can be split into two `3x2.5` rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a `6x2.5` rectangle. This is a valid case that the current program does not handle correctly.

3. **Suggested Fix:**
   - The suggested fix is to check if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, it means we can form another rectangle. This is correct and covers the missing cases.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not handle all cases correctly, specifically when both `a` and `b` are odd but their sum is even. The suggested fix is correct and should be implemented.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
