Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program counts the number of positions where the current character is greater than the next character, which is not relevant to the problem's requirement of cutting the string into pieces that can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

To solve this problem correctly, you should identify the points where the sequence changes from '0' to '1' because these points indicate where cuts can be made to form contiguous substrings that can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        last_zero_index = -1
        
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '1':
                if last_zero_index != -1:
                    count += 1
                last_zero_index = -1
            elif s[i] == '0':
                last_zero_index = i
        
        # If there was no '1' after the last '0', we need one more piece
        if last_zero_index != -1:
            count += 1
        
        print(count)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

This corrected program will correctly determine the minimum number of pieces needed to cut the string so that the pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.
