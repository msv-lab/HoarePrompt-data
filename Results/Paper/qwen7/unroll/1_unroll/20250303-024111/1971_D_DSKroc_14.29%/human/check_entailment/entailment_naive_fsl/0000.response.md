Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to count the number of places where the current character is greater than the next character, which is not the correct approach for solving the problem. This logic will not correctly determine the minimum number of cuts needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

For example, consider the input string "0101". According to the problem description, the correct output should be 2 because we can cut the string into "01" and "01" and rearrange them to form a sorted binary string. However, the program will incorrectly output 1 because it counts the number of places where the current character is greater than the next character, which is only once in this case.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to count the number of segments where the sequence changes from '0' to '1'. Each such segment indicates a place where we can make a cut. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        last_char = s[0]
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if last_char != s[i]:
                count += 1
                last_char = s[i]
        print(count + 1)

func()
```

This corrected program will correctly count the minimum number of cuts needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.
