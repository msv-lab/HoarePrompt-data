### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of pieces to cut a binary string into so that the pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string (i.e., all '0's come before all '1's).

2. **Key Insight**: The solution needs to identify the points where the string transitions from '0' to '1'. Each such transition indicates a natural place to split the string into pieces, because after the transition, all subsequent characters must be '1's to form a sorted string.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The code initializes `count` to 1, which represents the initial assumption that the entire string is one piece.
   - It iterates through the string, checking for transitions from '0' to '1'.
   - If such a transition is found, `count` is incremented, indicating an additional piece is needed.
   - After the loop, if a transition from '0' to '1' was detected (`flag` is true), `count` is decremented by 1. This adjustment accounts for the fact that the last piece does not need to be counted separately since it will naturally contain all '1's.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted (all '0's followed by all '1's), no cuts are needed, and `count` remains 1.
   - If the string consists entirely of '0's or '1's, only one piece is needed.
   - The logic correctly handles strings with multiple transitions from '0' to '1'.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic accurately identifies the necessary cuts based on transitions from '0' to '1'.
   - The decrement of `count` when a transition is found ensures that the final count reflects the minimum number of pieces required.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
