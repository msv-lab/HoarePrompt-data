Output State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and for each input string `s`, the output is the count of consecutive characters, with a special rule that if there is a '0' followed immediately by a '1', the count for that pair is not incremented. The final count value for each string is printed, and this process repeats for `t` strings.
