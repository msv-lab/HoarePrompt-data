Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of pieces to cut a binary string into so that the pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.
2. The provided function `func()` iterates over each test case, reads the binary string `s`, and calculates the number of cuts needed.
3. The logic in the function is as follows:
   - Initialize `count` to 1 because at least one piece is required.
   - Use a flag `flag` to check if there is a transition from '0' to '1'.
   - Iterate through the string and increment `count` whenever a transition from '0' to '1' is found.
   - If a transition from '0' to '1' is found, decrement `count` by 1 because the transition itself can be considered as the boundary between two pieces.
4. The logic correctly identifies the minimum number of cuts needed by counting transitions and adjusting for the final piece.
5. The function correctly handles all test cases provided in the example.

Correctness: **True**
