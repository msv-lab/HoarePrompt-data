Output State: **The output will depend on the input integers provided within the range of 1 to 10^4. For each input integer t, the program processes t lines of space-separated integers. It then checks the sorted unique list of these integers to determine if 'Alice' or 'Bob' should be printed based on specific conditions related to gaps between consecutive elements in the list.**

This description explains that the final state after the loop completes will vary based on the inputs given to the program, without specifying exact values since they can change with different inputs.
