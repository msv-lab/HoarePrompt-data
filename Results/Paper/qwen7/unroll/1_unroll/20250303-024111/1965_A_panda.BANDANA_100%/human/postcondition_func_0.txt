The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer t indicating the number of subsequent test cases, followed by t lines of input. Each line contains a positive integer n and a list of n integers. The function sorts and removes duplicate integers from the list, then checks the gaps between consecutive integers. Based on the presence of gaps greater than one and their positions, the function determines and prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
