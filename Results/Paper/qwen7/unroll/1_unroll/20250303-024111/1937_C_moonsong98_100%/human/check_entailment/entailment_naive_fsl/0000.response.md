Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not guarantee that it will find the optimal pair of indices (i, j) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized within the allowed 3n queries. Specifically, the logic in `func_3` does not ensure that the pair of indices found will always maximize the XOR value.

Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Initialization and First Query**: The program starts by querying three different pairs of indices to initialize `max_index`. However, this does not necessarily cover all possible pairs and might miss out on finding the optimal pair.

2. **Finding Minimum Indices**: After identifying `max_index`, the program tries to find the minimum indices that give the same result as `(p_0 | p_{max_index})`. This step is flawed because it only considers a subset of indices and does not guarantee that the optimal pair will be found.

3. **Final Pair Selection**: The final pair selected might not be the one that maximizes the XOR value. The program assumes that the minimum index found will lead to the optimal pair, but this is not always true.

Given these issues, the program does not guarantee that it will find the optimal pair of indices within the allowed 3n queries. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
