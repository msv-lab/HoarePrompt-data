Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly sends a query to the judge and waits for a response. The response is processed and returned correctly.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly sends the answer to the judge without returning any value, which is appropriate since the task requires printing the result directly.
3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - **Initialization**: Reads `n` and handles the base case where `n == 2` by directly providing the answer.
   - **Finding `max_index`**: Iterates through the array to find the index `max_index` where the bitwise OR of `0` and `max_index` is less than the bitwise OR of `0` and `i` for all `i` except `max_index`. This step ensures that `max_index` is the index that maximizes the left side of the comparison in the subsequent steps.
   - **Finding `min_indices`**: Iterates through the array again to find all indices `i` where the bitwise OR of `max_index` and `min_indices[0]` is equal to the bitwise OR of `max_index` and `i`. This step ensures that we have a set of indices that are likely to maximize the XOR with `max_index`.
   - **Finding `min_index`**: Iterates through the `min_indices` to find the smallest index that satisfies the condition in the previous step. This ensures that `min_index` is the best candidate to maximize the XOR with `max_index`.
   - **Final Answer**: Calls `func_2` with `max_index` and `min_index` as the final answer.

Given the logic and the way the functions interact, the program should correctly identify the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized using at most `3n` queries. The approach leverages the properties of bitwise operations to efficiently narrow down the potential candidates and select the optimal pair.

Correctness: **True**
