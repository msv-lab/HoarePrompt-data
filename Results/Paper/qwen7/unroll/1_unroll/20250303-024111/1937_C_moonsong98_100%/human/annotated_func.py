    #The program returns a string input by the user after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, each in the range [0, n). It prints these values and then waits for the user to input a string. After receiving the input, it strips any leading or trailing whitespace and returns the resulting string.

    #This is printed: ! [a] [b]

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` such that \(0 \leq a, b < n\), prints them to the console, and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program state includes the printed values of `a` and `b`.

Initially, `min_indices` contains only `max_index`.

If no such index exists, then `min_index` is equal to `max_index`.
    func_2(max_index, min_index)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` from the user, where `2 <= n <= 10^4`. It then calls `func_1` and `func_2` to determine two indices, `max_index` and `min_index`, based on certain conditions. Finally, it calls `func_2` with these two indices as arguments. The function does not return any value.
