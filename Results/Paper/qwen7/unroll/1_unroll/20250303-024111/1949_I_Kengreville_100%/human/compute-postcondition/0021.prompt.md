You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. x, y, and r are lists of length n, where for each 0 ≤ i < n, x[i], y[i] are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x[i], y[i] ≤ 10^9, and r[i] is an integer such that 1 ≤ r[i] ≤ 10^9. visited is a boolean list of length n initialized to False. coef is a list of length n initialized to None.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `visited` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to False, `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element is None.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: Output State: `bipartite` is True/False based on the result of all `dfs` calls, `n` is the same input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `visited` is a boolean list of length `n` with some elements possibly set to True, `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element is either 1 or None, `tot` is an integer that could be 0 or non-zero based on the sum of certain elements during the `dfs` calls, `ok` is True if any `dfs` call results in `bipartite` being True and `tot` not being 0, otherwise False.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `bipartite` is True if any `dfs` call results in `bipartite` being True and `tot` not being 0. Otherwise, `bipartite` is False.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but works with global variables n, x, y, r, visited, and coef, where n is an integer between 1 and 1000, x, y, and r are lists of length n with specific constraints on their elements, and visited and coef are boolean and None lists of length n respectively. The function does not return anything but modifies the global variables visited and coef based on certain conditions.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
