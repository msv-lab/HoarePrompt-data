Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `y` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is None, `visited` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to False, `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element is None.**

Explanation: The code initializes the `coef` list to a list of length `n` where each element is `None`. All other lists (`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition of the `coef` list being updated.
