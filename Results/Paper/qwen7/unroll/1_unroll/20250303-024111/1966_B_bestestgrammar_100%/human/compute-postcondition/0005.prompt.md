You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of n and m, both positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and the grid is represented by n lines, each containing m characters 'W' (white) and 'B' (black), with the guarantee that the total number of characters (n * m) across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        gr = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        
        ans = 'YES'
        
        if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
            impossible = True
            for j in range(m - 1):
                if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
            impossible = True
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an input integer, within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. After executing all iterations of the loop, the variable ans is set to 'YES' unless there is a condition where the first element of the first row does not match the last element of the last row, and it's impossible to make all corresponding elements equal by swapping columns or rows.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid represented by n lines, each containing m characters 'W' (white) and 'B' (black). It also accepts two positive integers t, n, and m, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and the total number of characters (n * m) does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The function returns information based on the grid configuration and the values of n, m, and t.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
