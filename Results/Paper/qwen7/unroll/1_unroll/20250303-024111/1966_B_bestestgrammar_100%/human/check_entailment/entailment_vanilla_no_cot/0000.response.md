Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it only checks the colors at the corners and edges of the grid, which is insufficient to determine whether all squares can be made the same color. The logic fails to consider more complex patterns within the grid.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if there exists a consistent color pattern across the entire grid. Specifically, we should verify if all rows or all columns are the same color. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if all rows are the same
        all_rows_same = all(gr[0] == gr[i] for i in range(1, n))
        
        # Check if all columns are the same
        all_columns_same = all(all(gr[i][0] == gr[i][j] for j in range(1, m)) for i in range(n))
        
        if all_rows_same or all_columns_same:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

This solution checks if all rows are identical or if all columns are identical. If either condition is true, it means all squares can be made the same color through the allowed operations.
