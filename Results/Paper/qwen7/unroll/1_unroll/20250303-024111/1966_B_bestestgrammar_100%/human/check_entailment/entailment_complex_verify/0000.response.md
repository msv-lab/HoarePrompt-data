### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated version step-by-step to evaluate its correctness.

#### Initial Analysis:
The program iterates over each test case and checks if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by ensuring that the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same color. If they are different, it further checks if the entire first row and the entire last column are the same color. If either of these conditions holds true, it concludes that it's impossible to make all squares the same color and sets `ans` to 'NO'. Otherwise, it sets `ans` to 'YES'.

#### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:
1. **Input Reading and Grid Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then reads the dimensions `n` and `m` for each test case.
   - The grid is correctly initialized with `n` rows and `m` columns.

2. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the top-left (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) corners are the same color.
     - If they are different, it proceeds to check if the entire first row and the entire last column are the same color.
       - If the first row or the last column are different, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
       - If both the first row and the last column are the same, it sets `ans` to 'YES'.

3. **Edge Cases and Scenarios:**
   - The program does not consider all possible ways to make all squares the same color. For example, it does not check if the entire grid can be made uniform by swapping rows or columns in a more complex manner.
   - The program only checks the first row and the last column, which is insufficient to cover all possible configurations where it might be possible to make all squares the same color.

#### Example Test Case:
Consider the test case:
```
3 3
BWW
WWB
BWW
```
- The top-left corner is 'B' and the bottom-right corner is 'B', so the initial check passes.
- The first row is 'BWW' and the last column is 'WBB', which are different, so the program sets `ans` to 'NO'.
- However, it is possible to make all squares the same color by performing the following operations:
  - Select (1, 1) and (3, 3) to make all squares 'B'.
  - Select (1, 2) and (3, 2) to make all squares 'W'.
- The program fails to recognize this possibility because it only checks the first row and the last column.

#### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible scenarios where it might be possible to make all squares the same color. It only checks specific conditions (first row and last column) and misses other valid configurations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect as it does not cover all possible scenarios where it might be possible to make all squares the same color.
