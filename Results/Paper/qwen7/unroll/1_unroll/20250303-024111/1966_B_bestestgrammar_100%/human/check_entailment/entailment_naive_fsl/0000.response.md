Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it checks only two conditions to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color, but it misses other scenarios where it might still be possible to achieve this goal.

Consider the following test case:
```
3 3
BWW
WWB
BWW
```

In this case, the program would incorrectly output "NO" because it only checks the top-left and bottom-right corners and the edges, but it doesn't consider the possibility of making all squares the same color through different operations. For instance, selecting (1, 1) and (3, 3) would make all squares 'B', and selecting (1, 2) and (3, 2) would make all squares 'W'. Therefore, the program fails to recognize that it is possible to make all squares the same color in this scenario.
