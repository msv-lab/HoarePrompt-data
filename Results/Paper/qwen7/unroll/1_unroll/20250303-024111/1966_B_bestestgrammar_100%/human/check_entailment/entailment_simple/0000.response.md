Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` and the grid representation.
3. The logic checks if the top-left (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) elements of the grid are the same. If they are different, it immediately sets `ans` to 'NO' because it's impossible to make all squares the same color due to the constraints of the operations.
4. If the top-left and bottom-right elements are the same, it further checks if all elements in the first row and the last column are the same. This is done by checking if all adjacent elements in the first row and the last column are the same.
5. If either of these checks fails, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
6. Otherwise, it sets `ans` to 'YES', indicating that it's possible to make all squares the same color.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the program logic aligns with the requirements. It correctly identifies whether it's possible to make all squares the same color based on the initial configuration of the grid.

Correctness: **True**
