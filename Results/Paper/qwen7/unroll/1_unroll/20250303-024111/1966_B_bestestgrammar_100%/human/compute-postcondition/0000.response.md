Output State: **t is an input integer, within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the only change is that `t` now holds the value entered as an integer. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
