Precondition: **cities is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, and n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. Each coordinate a_i satisfies 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9. Additionally, there are m queries, where each query consists of two distinct integers x_i and y_i representing the indices of the cities for which the minimum number of coins to travel between them needs to be calculated, and 1 <= m <= 10^5.**
