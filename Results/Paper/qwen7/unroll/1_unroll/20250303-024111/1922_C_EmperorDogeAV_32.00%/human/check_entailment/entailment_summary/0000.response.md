Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: The function `func_1` correctly identifies the closest city for each city by comparing the absolute differences with the previous and next cities. If the next city is closer, it assigns 1; otherwise, it assigns the absolute difference.
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) are calculated correctly for the forward and backward directions. These sums are used to quickly compute the sum of distances between any two cities in the respective directions.
3. **Query Processing**: The program processes each query correctly by using the appropriate prefix sum array based on the direction of travel (forward or backward). It calculates the minimum cost by subtracting the relevant prefix sums.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases where the queries might involve the start or end of the city list, as it uses the prefix sums appropriately.

Given the execution summary and the analysis above, the program appears to be correct and follows the logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
