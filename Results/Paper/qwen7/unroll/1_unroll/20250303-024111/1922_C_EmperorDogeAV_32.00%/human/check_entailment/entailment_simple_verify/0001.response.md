### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum cost to travel between two cities.
   - The cost includes traveling to the closest city (cost = 1) and traveling directly between any two cities (cost = distance).

2. **Key Components:**
   - `func_1` function is supposed to compute the cost to travel to the next closest city.
   - `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` arrays store these costs.
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are prefix sums of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`.

3. **Analysis of the Code:**
   - The code reads the input correctly and processes each test case.
   - `func_1` is intended to compute the cost to travel to the next closest city but is implemented incorrectly.
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed because:
     - It uses `-99999999` and `99999999` as placeholders, which might not work as expected.
     - It doesn't properly handle the closest city logic.
   - The prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) are computed correctly.
   - The queries are processed correctly using the prefix sums.

4. **Testing with Example:**
   - Let's test the `func_1` function with the example provided:
     - Cities: `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`
     - Expected output for `func_1` should be `[8, 4, 3, 5]` (costs to reach the next closest city).
     - The actual output is incorrect due to the flawed logic.

5. **Detailed Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates through the list of cities and tries to determine the closest city.
   - However, the logic inside the loop is incorrect:
     - `back` is set to `-99999999` and `forward` is set to `99999999`, which are not meaningful values for determining the closest city.
     - The condition `if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):` is flawed because `back` is always `-99999999` and `forward` is always `99999999`.
     - The correct logic should be to compare the distances to the previous and next city and choose the minimum.

6. **Correct Implementation of `func_1`:**
   - A correct implementation would be:
     ```python
     def func_1(cities, n):
         prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
         for i in range(n - 1):
             back = cities[i - 1] if i > 0 else float('inf')
             forward = cities[i + 1] if i < n - 1 else float('inf')
             prog_cities[i] = min(abs(forward - cities[i]), abs(cities[i] - back))
         return prog_cities
     ```

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The main issue lies in the `func_1` function, which does not correctly compute the closest city costs.
   - The rest of the code handles the queries correctly once the costs are computed.

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because the `func_1` function is flawed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of the `func_1` function.
