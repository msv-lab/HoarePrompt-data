Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line, where the cost depends on whether you move directly to another city or to the closest city. The closest city is defined as the city that minimizes the distance to the current city.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates an auxiliary list `prog_cities` where each element is either 1 (if moving to the next city is cheaper) or the absolute difference between the current city and the next city.
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the closest city for each city based on the given constraints.

3. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - The main program processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the city coordinates, computes the forward and backward distances using `func_1`, and then processes the queries.
   - The logic to compute the prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) is correct. These prefix sums help in quickly calculating the cost of moving between any two cities.
   - The logic to handle queries and output the results is also correct. It uses the prefix sums to determine the minimum cost efficiently.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints and edge cases are handled correctly. The program processes up to \(10^5\) test cases, each with up to \(10^5\) queries, ensuring efficiency through the use of prefix sums.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem specification accurately.

Correctness: **True**
