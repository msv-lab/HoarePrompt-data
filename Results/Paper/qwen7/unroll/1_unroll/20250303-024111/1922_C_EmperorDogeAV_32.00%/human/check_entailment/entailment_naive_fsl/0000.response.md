Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the closest city for each city. The `func_1` function attempts to determine the closest city but does not handle the logic correctly. Specifically, the function does not ensure that the closest city is unique and correctly identifies the closest city based on the given conditions.

For example, consider the cities located in points `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`. According to the problem description, the closest city to city 1 is city 2, to city 2 is city 3, to city 3 is city 4, to city 4 is city 3, and to city 5 is city 4. However, the provided code does not correctly identify these closest cities. The logic in `func_1` does not properly compare distances to determine the closest city, leading to incorrect results.

To illustrate, the output for the sample input provided in the problem statement is incorrect. The expected outputs for the queries are `3`, `8`, `1`, `4`, and `14`, but the program does not produce these results due to the incorrect implementation of finding the closest city. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
