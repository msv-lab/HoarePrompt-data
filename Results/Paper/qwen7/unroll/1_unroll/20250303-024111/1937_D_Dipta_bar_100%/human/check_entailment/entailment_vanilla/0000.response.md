Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the grid and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - It uses two arrays `A` and `B` to store the cumulative times for pinballs moving to the right and left respectively.
   - `idx_A` and `idx_B` are used to keep track of indices where the direction changes.
   - The logic for calculating the times seems complex and involves multiple steps:
     - For each index `i` where `s[i] == '>'`, it updates the cumulative time `A`.
     - Similarly, for each index `i` where `s[i] == '<`', it updates the cumulative time `B`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop iterates through each cell and calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid.
   - The logic here involves checking the direction of the pinball and using the precomputed times stored in `A` and `B`.
   - The calculations involve adjusting the cumulative times based on the current position and direction.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Cumulative Time Calculation:**
   - The cumulative times `A` and `B` are calculated correctly based on the initial directions.
   - The logic for updating these times seems correct, but it might be overly complex and could be simplified.

2. **Time Calculation for Each Cell:**
   - The main loop correctly handles the calculation of the time for each cell.
   - It uses the precomputed times from `A` and `B` to adjust the final result.
   - The adjustments made to the times seem to account for the direction changes and the positions of the cells.

### Testing and Validation:

To validate the correctness, let's consider the example provided:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Grid: `><<`
  - Expected Output: `3 6 5`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Grid: `<<<<`
  - Expected Output: `1 2 3 4`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Grid: `<><<<<`
  - Expected Output: `1 4 7 10 8 1`

By running the program with these test cases, we can verify if the output matches the expected results.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the code and considering the example test cases, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

**Correctness: True**
