You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and calculates and prints the value of a specific expression for each index in the string. The expression is based on the cumulative sums of indices of '>' and '<' characters and their positions. The function does not return any value but prints the calculated values for each index.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the grid and the string `s` representing the grid configuration.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from different positions.
   - It uses two arrays `A` and `B` to store the cumulative times for pinballs moving right and left, respectively.
   - The logic for calculating these times seems complex and involves several nested loops and conditional checks.

3. **Calculation of Times:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid by considering the direction of movement and the changes in the grid configuration.
   - However, the logic for calculating the times appears to be overly complicated and may not correctly handle all edge cases, especially for large grids.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the time taken for each query (each position in the grid).

### Detailed Analysis of the Logic

- **Array `A`:**
  - This array is supposed to store the cumulative times for pinballs moving right.
  - The logic for updating `A` seems to be based on the positions where the direction changes from `<` to `>`.

- **Array `B`:**
  - This array is supposed to store the cumulative times for pinballs moving left.
  - The logic for updating `B` seems to be based on the positions where the direction changes from `>` to `<`.

- **Main Loop:**
  - The main loop iterates through each position in the grid and calculates the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid.
  - The calculations involve complex arithmetic operations and conditional checks, which might not be necessary and could lead to errors.

### Example Test Case Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided example test case:

```plaintext
3
3
><<
4
<<<<
6
<><<<<
```

#### Expected Output:
- For `><<`:
  - Position 1: 3 seconds
  - Position 2: 6 seconds
  - Position 3: 5 seconds

- For `<<<<`:
  - Position 1: 1 second
  - Position 2: 2 seconds
  - Position 3: 3 seconds
  - Position 4: 4 seconds

- For `<><<<<`:
  - Position 1: 1 second
  - Position 2: 4 seconds
  - Position 3: 7 seconds
  - Position 4: 10 seconds
  - Position 5: 8 seconds
  - Position 6: 1 second

### Conclusion

Upon detailed analysis, the provided program seems to have a complex and potentially incorrect logic for calculating the times. The calculations involve unnecessary complexity and might not handle all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is likely incorrect.
