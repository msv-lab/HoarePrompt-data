Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `num` which is being assigned values from the `numbers` list.

2. **Determine the initial state of `num`**: Since the loop starts with the first element of the `numbers` list, `num` will be set to the first element of the `numbers` list.

3. **Consider the properties of `numbers`**: The `numbers` list is sorted in descending order, meaning the first element is the largest.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that the loop can start and that `num` is correctly initialized to the first element of the `numbers` list.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `num` should be the first element of the `numbers` list.
- `numbers` must be a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order.

So, the final state after adjusting the necessary variables for the loop to execute is:

**State: `num` is the first element of the `numbers` list, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers such that 1 ≤ `na`, `nb`, `nc` ≤ `n`-2 and `na` + `nb` + `nc` = `n`, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are both 0.**
