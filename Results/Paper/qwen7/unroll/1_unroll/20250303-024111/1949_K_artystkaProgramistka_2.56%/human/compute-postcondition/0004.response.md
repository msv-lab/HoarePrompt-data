Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop iterates over the `numbers` list, so the only variable involved in the loop head is `num`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `num`**: Since the loop starts iterating from the first element of the `numbers` list, `num` will take the value of the first element of `numbers` during the first iteration.

3. **Consider the properties of `numbers`**: The `numbers` list is sorted in descending order, meaning the first element (`num` during the first iteration) is the largest number in the list.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing, which means `numbers` must have at least one element. Additionally, since `num` takes the value of the first element of `numbers`, we need to specify what that first element is.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `numbers` must be a non-empty list (since the loop iterates over the elements of `numbers`).
- `num` must be the first element of `numbers`.

Therefore, the state after adjusting for the loop to execute is:

**State: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers such that 1 ≤ `na`, `nb`, `nc` ≤ `n`-2 and `na` + `nb` + `nc` = `n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 10^9 for each `x_i` in `numbers` and `numbers` is sorted in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are both 0, `numbers` is a non-empty list, and `num` is the first element of `numbers`.**
