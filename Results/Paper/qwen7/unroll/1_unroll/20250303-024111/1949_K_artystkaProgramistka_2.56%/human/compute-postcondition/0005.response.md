Output State: `na` elements in `group_a` with their sum `sum_a`, `nb` elements in `group_b` with their sum `sum_b`, `nc` elements in `group_c` with their sum `sum_c`, where each element in `numbers` has been distributed among `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` such that the first `na` elements are in `group_a`, the next `nb` elements are in `group_b`, and the remaining `nc` elements are in `group_c`. The sums `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` represent the total of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`, respectively.
