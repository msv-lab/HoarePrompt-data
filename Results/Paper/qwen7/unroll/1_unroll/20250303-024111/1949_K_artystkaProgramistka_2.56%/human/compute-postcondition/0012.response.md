Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer between 3 and 200,000), `na` and `nb` and `nc` (integers between 1 and `n-2` such that their sum equals `n`), and `numbers` (a list of `n` positive integers each between 1 and \(10^9\)). It sorts the `numbers` list in descending order and then distributes the elements into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`) based on the values of `na`, `nb`, and `nc`. After distribution, it checks if the sums of the elements in these groups satisfy a condition using `func_1`. If the condition is met, it returns `'YES'` along with the three groups; otherwise, it returns `'NO'`.**
