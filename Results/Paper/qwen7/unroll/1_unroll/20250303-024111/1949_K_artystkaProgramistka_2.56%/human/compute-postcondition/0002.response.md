Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers such that 1 ≤ `na`, `nb`, `nc` ≤ `n`-2 and `na` + `nb` + `nc` = `n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 10^9 for each `x_i` in `numbers`, and `numbers` is sorted in descending order; `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists; `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are both 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes three variables `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, `numbers`, or the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
