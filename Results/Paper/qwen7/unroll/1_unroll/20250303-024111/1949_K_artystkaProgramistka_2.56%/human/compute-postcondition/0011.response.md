Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n (an integer between 3 and 200,000), na and nb and nc (integers between 1 and n-2 such that their sum equals n), and numbers (a list of n positive integers each between 1 and 10^9). It returns either 'YES' along with three groups of indices (group_a, group_b, group_c) if it's possible to divide the list into three groups with sizes na, nb, and nc respectively, or 'NO' if it's not possible.**
