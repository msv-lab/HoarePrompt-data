Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Kirill wants to be among the first `m` people in the queue.
- For each position `i`, there are two costs: `a_i` (cost to swap with the person at position `i`) and `b_i` (cost for each person between positions `j` and `k` when swapping from `i` to `j`).
- The goal is to minimize the total cost while ensuring Kirill ends up in one of the first `m` positions.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `x`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading `num_fila` and `max_p`.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `custo` (total cost) to 0.
   - It iterates backward from `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1` to calculate the cost of moving to the first `m` positions.
   - For each position `y` in this range, it checks whether it is cheaper to use `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]`:
     - If `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`, it adds `a_values[y]` to `custo`.
     - Otherwise, it adds `b_values[y]` to `custo`.
   - After calculating the initial cost, it further optimizes by iterating backward from `max_p - 1` to `1`:
     - It checks if swapping from `y` to `y - 1` is cheaper than staying at `y`:
       - If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`, it adds `b_values[y]` to `custo` and breaks out of the loop if `y == 1`.
       - Otherwise, it adds `a_values[y]` to `custo` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Output:**
   - The program appends the calculated cost for each test case to `custos` and prints them at the end.

### Correctness Check:
- The logic for calculating the minimum cost seems correct based on the problem statement.
- The program handles the backward iteration and cost calculation appropriately.
- The logic ensures that Kirill ends up in one of the first `m` positions and minimizes the cost.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
