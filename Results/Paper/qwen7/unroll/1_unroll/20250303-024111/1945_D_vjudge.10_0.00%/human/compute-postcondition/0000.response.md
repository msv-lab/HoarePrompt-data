Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, x is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user. The value of `t` remains unchanged as the input is taken for `x`. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4.
