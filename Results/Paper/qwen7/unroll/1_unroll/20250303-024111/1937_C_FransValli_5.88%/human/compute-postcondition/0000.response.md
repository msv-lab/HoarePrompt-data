Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop**: We know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This means that `int(input())` will return a value within this range.

3. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a valid value within the specified range. Since `t` is already defined as being in the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), we can assume that the input will be within this range.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input value itself, ensuring it falls within the specified range.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and the input value must be within this range.**
