Output State: **`pos` is 0, `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from `range(n)` sorted based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`, `n` is the length of list `a`, `a` is a list of non-negative integers representing the health of n monsters, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of the n monsters, and `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of bullets you can fire per second, `distance` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `pos = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `pos`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
