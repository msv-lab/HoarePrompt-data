### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program reads the input and processes each test case to decode the encoded string. However, there is a critical flaw in the decoding logic within the `func_1` function. Specifically, the function is designed to encode a string rather than decode it.

Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - **Constructing the Auxiliary String `r`:**
     - `r` is constructed by taking the sorted unique characters of the encoded string `b`. This part is correct.
   - **Creating the Mapping:**
     - A dictionary `mapping` is created where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character from the end of `r`. This mapping is correct for encoding but not for decoding.
   - **Decoding the Encoded String:**
     - The encoded string `b` is decoded by replacing each character with its corresponding symmetric character from `r`. This is the issue. Instead of decoding, this step is actually performing an encoding operation.

To decode the string, we need to reverse the mapping. Specifically, we should map each character in `r` to its corresponding character from the beginning of `r`.

### Corrected Decoding Logic:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {char: r[i] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    return ''.join((mapping[char] for char in encoded))
```

With this corrected mapping, the program will correctly decode the encoded string.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the above reasoning, the original program is incorrect because it performs encoding instead of decoding. The corrected version of the `func_1` function should be used.

**Final: False**

The original assessment was inaccurate due to the misinterpretation of the decoding process.
