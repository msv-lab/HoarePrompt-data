Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the decoding logic as per the problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and splits it into parts. It then iterates over each test case.
2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - For each test case, it extracts the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.
   - It constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters of `b` alphabetically.
   - It creates a dictionary `mapping` that maps each character in `r` to its corresponding character from the end of `r`.
   - Finally, it decodes the `encoded` string `b` using the `mapping` dictionary.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program appears to follow the correct steps for decoding the string. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
