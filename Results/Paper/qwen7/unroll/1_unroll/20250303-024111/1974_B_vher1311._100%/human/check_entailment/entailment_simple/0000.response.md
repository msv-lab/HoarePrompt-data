Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases as required.
2. The `func_1` function is designed to decode the encoded string according to the specified algorithm.
   - It first creates the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters of the encoded string.
   - It then creates a mapping where each character in `r` (in ascending order) is paired with its corresponding character in reverse order within `r`.
   - Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the encoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its mapped character.
3. The logic in `func_1` accurately implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement.
4. The program prints the decoded strings for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
