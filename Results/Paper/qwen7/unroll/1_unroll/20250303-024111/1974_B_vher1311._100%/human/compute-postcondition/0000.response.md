Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `r` is a string containing each unique character from `encoded` sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))` creates a new string `r` by first converting the string `encoded` into a set to remove duplicate characters, then sorting these unique characters in ascending order, and finally joining them back into a string. The length of `encoded` remains unchanged, and the properties of `encoded` as a string of lowercase Latin letters with a specific length range are preserved.
