You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `a` of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and an integer `k` such that 1 <= k <= n. It identifies indices in the list `a` where elements are greater than the `k`-th element of the list. Based on the number of such indices and their positions, it returns one of seven possible values: `n - 1`, `13`, `ind[0] - 1`, `14 - ind[0]`, the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `13`, or the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and either `ind[1] - ind[0]` or `14 - ind[0]`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the number of matches the cow at position `k` can win by either swapping its position with another cow or doing nothing. The matches are structured such that each subsequent match involves the winner of the previous match and the cow in the next position.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It maps the positions and ratings of the cows.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find the best position to swap the cow at position `k` to maximize its number of wins.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function takes the list of cow ratings `a`.
   - It identifies the rating of the cow at position `k` (`x`).
   - It then iterates through the list to find the indices of the cows with ratings greater than `x` and stores them in `ind`.
   - If `ind` is empty, it returns `n - 1`, meaning the cow can potentially win all remaining matches.
   - If `ind` has exactly one element, it checks if this element is the first position. If so, it returns `k - 1`. Otherwise, it returns the minimum distance to the next cow with a higher rating.
   - If `ind` has two elements, it calculates the maximum possible wins based on the positions of these two cows relative to `k`.

4. **Edge Cases and Correctness**:
   - The logic handles the edge case where no cows have a higher rating (`ind == []`), returning `n - 1`.
   - It also handles the case where there is only one cow with a higher rating, and the cow at position `k` is not the first cow.
   - The function correctly calculates the maximum number of wins by considering the positions of the cows with higher ratings relative to `k`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The code appears to handle all described scenarios and edge cases appropriately.
   - The logic for determining the maximum number of wins is sound and follows the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
