You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` distinct integers. It returns one of the following based on specific conditions:

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns n - 1

Case_2: The program returns 13

Case_3: The program returns a value which is `ind[0] - 1`. Given that `ind` is a list containing exactly one index where the elements in `a` are greater than `x`, and `ind[0]` is greater than 14, the returned value will be an integer that is 1 less than the index stored in `ind[0]`.

Case_4: The program returns 14 - ind[0]

Case_5: The program returns the minimum value between the second element of list ind minus 1 and 13 (since k is 14)

Case_6: The program returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (ind[1] - ind[0]), where ind[0] is not 0 and both ind[0] and ind[1] are indices in the list a.

Case_7: The program returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (14 - ind[0]) where ind[0] is the first element of the list ind.
