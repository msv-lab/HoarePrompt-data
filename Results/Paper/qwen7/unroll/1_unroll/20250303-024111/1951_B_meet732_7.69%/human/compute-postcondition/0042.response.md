Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` distinct integers. It returns one of the following based on specific conditions:**

- `n - 1`
- `13`
- `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind` is a list containing exactly one index where the elements in `a` are greater than `x`, and `ind[0]` is greater than 14.
- `14 - ind[0]`
- The minimum value between the second element of list `ind` minus 1 and 13.
- The maximum value between `(ind[0] - 1)` and `(ind[1] - ind[0])`, where `ind[0]` is not 0 and both `ind[0]` and `ind[1]` are indices in the list `a`.
- The maximum value between `(ind[0] - 1)` and `(14 - ind[0])`, where `ind[0]` is the first element of the list `ind`.
