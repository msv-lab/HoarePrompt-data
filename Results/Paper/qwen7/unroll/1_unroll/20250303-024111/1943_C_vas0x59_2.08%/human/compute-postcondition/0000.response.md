Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` remains unchanged as a list of lists where u2vs[i] is a list of integers representing the neighbors of vertex i.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. However, the initial state of `u2vs` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the input operation.
