Output State: `n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each list contains its corresponding index's connected indices after processing all the edges provided through user input. Each pair `(u, v)` from input represents an undirected edge between nodes `u` and `v`, and this edge is added to both `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]`.
