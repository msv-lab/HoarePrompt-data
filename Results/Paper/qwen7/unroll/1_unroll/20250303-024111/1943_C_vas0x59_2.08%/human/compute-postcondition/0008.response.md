Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each list contains its corresponding index's connected indices after processing all the edges provided through user input, `d` is the result of the BFS starting from node 0, `previous` is the variable storing the previous nodes during BFS, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The code `b = func_1(d)` assigns the result of calling the function `func_1` with the argument `d` to the variable `b`. The values of `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, and `a` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions and the new assignment for `b`.
