Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`, `n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each list contains its corresponding index's connected indices after processing all the edges provided through user input, `d` is the result of the BFS starting from node 0, `previous` is the variable storing the previous nodes during BFS, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)**.

This means that the variable `path_ba` now contains a list with a single element, which is the value of `b`. All other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
