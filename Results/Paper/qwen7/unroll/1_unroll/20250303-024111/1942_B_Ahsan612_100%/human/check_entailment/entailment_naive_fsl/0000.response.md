Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a valid permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Specifically, the logic used to determine the value of \( res[i] \) is flawed. The program attempts to calculate \( res[i] \) as \( mex - ar[i] \), but this approach does not ensure that the resulting \( p \) is a valid permutation and satisfies the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

For example, consider the input:
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```
The expected output is a valid permutation \( p \) such that the array \( a \) is generated correctly. However, the provided program does not guarantee this. A correct approach would involve constructing \( p \) iteratively while ensuring that the MEX condition is met at each step.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [-1] * n
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if res[i] == -1:
                res[i] = mex - ar[i]
                while mex in res:
                    mex += 1
                if res[i] >= n:
                    res[i] = mex
                    mex += 1
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the permutation \( p \) is constructed correctly by maintaining the MEX condition at each step.
