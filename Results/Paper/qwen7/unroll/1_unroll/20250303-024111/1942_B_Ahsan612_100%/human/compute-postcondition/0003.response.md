Functionality: **The function accepts a single parameter `t`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case within `t`, it accepts two additional parameters: `n`, a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and `a`, a list of `n` integers where -`n` ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n` for all 1 ≤ i ≤ `n`. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided information.**

However, based on the typical structure of such functions, it might be implied that the function processes the list `a` for each test case defined by `t` and `n`, but without further details, we cannot specify the exact return value.
