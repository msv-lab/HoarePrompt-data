Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) from an array \( a \), where each element \( a_i \) is defined as the MEX (minimum excluded value) of the prefix \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i \) minus \( p_i \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function iterates through the array \( a \) in reverse order.
   - For each index \( i \), it sets \( res[i] = mex - ar[i] \).
   - It updates \( mex \) to ensure it correctly reflects the minimum non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The algorithm correctly computes \( res[i] \) as \( mex - ar[i] \).
   - The update of \( mex \) ensures that the next value of \( mex \) is correctly determined after setting \( res[i] \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the reverse iteration correctly, ensuring that the permutation is built from the end to the beginning.
   - The logic for updating \( mex \) ensures that the smallest unused integer is chosen for each position in the permutation.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the resulting permutation \( res \) for each test case, which should satisfy the given conditions.

6. **Verification**:
   - Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the required logic.

Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the algorithm to generate a valid permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \). Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified.

Correctness: **True**
