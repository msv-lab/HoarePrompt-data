Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). However, the logic used to compute the permutation \( p \) is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the value of `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]` instead of finding the actual value of \( p_i \) that would satisfy the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find a permutation \( p \) such that for each \( i \), \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). This requires a more sophisticated approach, typically involving a greedy algorithm that ensures the MEX condition is met step-by-step.

Given the flaws in the current implementation, the provided program does not correctly generate the desired permutation \( p \). Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
