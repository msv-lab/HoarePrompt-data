Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to solve the problem but contains several logical errors and issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `mex`**: The program calculates `mex` incorrectly. It should find the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current subarray, but the logic used does not correctly achieve this.

2. **Reversing the Array**: The program iterates in reverse order to fill the result array, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The correct approach is to iterate forward and ensure that each element in the result array is placed correctly based on the MEX value.

3. **Logic for Finding `mex`**: The logic to update `mex` is flawed. The variable `mex` should be updated based on the presence of values in the array, not just by subtracting `ar[i]`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        mex = 0
        
        # Ensure all elements in res are set to their initial values
        for i in range(n):
            res[i] = i
        
        # Iterate through the array to adjust the result based on MEX
        for i in range(n):
            if res[i] != i + ar[i]:
                mex = i + ar[i]
                break
        
        for i in range(n):
            if res[i] == i + ar[i]:
                continue
            while mex in res[:i]:
                mex += 1
            res[i] = mex
            mex += 1
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `mex` value is correctly calculated and applied to the result array. It iterates through the array and adjusts the result based on the MEX value, ensuring that each element is placed correctly.
