Reasoning:

1. The function `func_1()` correctly processes each test case by converting the time from the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format.
2. It handles the conversion of hours properly:
   - If the hour is '00', it correctly prints '12'.
   - If the hour is between '01' and '12', it directly prints the hour.
   - If the hour is between '13' and '23', it correctly adjusts the hour to the 12-hour format by subtracting 12 and adding a leading zero if necessary.
3. The function correctly appends 'AM' or 'PM' based on whether the hour in the 24-hour format is 12 or greater.
4. The function processes all test cases as required and prints the formatted times in the specified format.

Given the above points, the function `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to convert times from the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format and prints them in the correct format.

Correctness: **True**
