Output State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 6 (including the AM/PM indicator) representing the formatted time in the 12-hour format based on the original input time in the 24-hour format. The first two characters of s represent the hour in the 12-hour format, followed by ":", then the original minutes from the input time, and finally either "AM" or "PM" depending on whether the original hour was 12 or greater than 12.
