### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the input for each test case, including the number of messages (`n`), initial charge (`f`), charge consumption per unit of time (`a`), and the charge consumption for turning off and on (`b`). It also correctly parses the list of message times (`arr`).

However, there are several issues with the charge calculation logic and the overall approach:

3. **Charge Calculation Logic**:
   - For the first message, the function checks if the time to send the first message is less than the cost of turning off and on the phone (`b / a`). If it is, the function calculates the charge used as `arr[0] * a`.
   - For subsequent messages, the function checks if the time between consecutive messages is less than the cost of turning off and on the phone (`b / a`). If it is, the function calculates the charge used as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.
   - The function stores these charges in `array2`.

   **Issue**: The logic for determining whether to turn off and on the phone is flawed. The function should consider the cumulative charge usage and the optimal strategy for minimizing the number of turns off and on. The current logic only considers the direct comparison of the time difference with `b / a`, which may not always yield the minimum charge usage.

4. **Total Charge Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the total charge used for sending all messages and turning off/on the phone.
   - It sums the charges from `array2` and adds the charge for turning off and on the phone for the remaining messages (`(n - len(array2)) * b`).

   **Issue**: The total charge calculation does not account for the optimal strategy of minimizing the number of turns off and on. The function assumes that every time the time difference is less than `b / a`, a turn off and on is necessary, which is not always the case.

5. **Comparison with Initial Charge**:
   - The function compares the calculated total charge with the initial charge (`f`).
   - If the total charge is less than or equal to `f`, the function prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

   **Issue**: The comparison step is correct, but the preceding logic for calculating the total charge is flawed.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating the charge used for sending messages and turning off/on the phone is incorrect. The function does not account for the optimal strategy of minimizing the number of turns off and on.
- The summation and comparison steps are correct, but they are based on an incorrect charge calculation.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The function fails to account for the optimal strategy of minimizing the number of turns off and on the phone, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
