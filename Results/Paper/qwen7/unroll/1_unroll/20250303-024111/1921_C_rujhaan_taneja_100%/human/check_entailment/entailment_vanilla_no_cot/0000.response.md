Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem:

1. **Logic Error in Charge Calculation**: The logic for calculating the total charge used is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the charge usage between message sending times and the cost of turning the phone on and off.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Turning Off and On**: The program does not properly handle the scenario where turning the phone off and on might be necessary to save charge. It assumes that turning the phone off and on only happens at the start or end of the sequence, which is not always the optimal strategy.

3. **Incorrect Summation and Comparison**: The program sums up the charges incorrectly and does not consider the optimal strategy for minimizing charge usage.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total time to send all messages
        total_time = arr[-1]
        
        # Calculate the minimum charge needed without turning off and on
        min_charge_needed = total_time * a
        
        # Calculate the number of times we need to turn off and on
        num_turns = (total_time - 1) // (b / a)
        
        # Calculate the total charge used with turns
        total_charge_used = min_charge_needed + num_turns * b
        
        if total_charge_used <= f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the total charge needed considering both the continuous charge usage and the charge used for turning the phone on and off. It then compares this with the initial charge `f` to determine if Stepan can send all messages.
