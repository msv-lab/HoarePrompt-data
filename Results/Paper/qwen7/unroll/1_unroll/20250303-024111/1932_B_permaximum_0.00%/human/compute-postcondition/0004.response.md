Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes inputs through a series of constraints where t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and for each test case, n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive). The function does not return a specific value but rather processes these inputs according to given constraints.**
