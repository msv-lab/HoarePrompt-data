Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it calculates a value `year` based on the input list `a`, where `year` is incremented by the minimum of itself and each element in the list `a`. Finally, it prints the calculated `year` for each test case.**
