Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to decode a string `b` back to the original string `s`. The string `b` is the result of encoding `s` according to the given rules.
2. **Encoding Process Recap**:
   - Construct an auxiliary string `r` with all distinct characters of `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Replace each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart from `r`.

3. **Decoding Process**:
   - To decode, we need to reverse the process.
   - We need to reconstruct the string `r` from `b`.
   - Then, map each character in `b` to its corresponding character in `r`.

4. **Analysis of Provided Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the encoded string `b`.
   - It calls `func_1(b)` to decode the string.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the string `b` back to `s`.

5. **Issues in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is trying to replace characters in `s` directly, but `s` is not being updated correctly.
   - It attempts to insert characters into `unique_chars`, but this approach is incorrect because `unique_chars` should remain fixed and only be used for mapping.
   - The logic for replacing characters in `b` with their symmetric counterparts is flawed.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - First, construct `r` from `b` by identifying the unique characters and sorting them.
   - Then, create a mapping from each character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
   - Finally, use this mapping to decode `b` back to `s`.

Given these issues, the provided code is incorrect because it does not properly decode the string `b` back to `s`.

Correctness: **False**
