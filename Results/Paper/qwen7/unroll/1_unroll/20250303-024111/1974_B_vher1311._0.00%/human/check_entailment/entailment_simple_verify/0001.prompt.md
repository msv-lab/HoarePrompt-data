You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to decode a string `b` back to the original string `s`. The string `b` is the result of encoding `s` according to the given rules.
2. **Encoding Process Recap**:
   - Construct an auxiliary string `r` with all distinct characters of `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Replace each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart from `r`.

3. **Decoding Process**:
   - To decode, we need to reverse the process.
   - We need to reconstruct the string `r` from `b`.
   - Then, map each character in `b` to its corresponding character in `r`.

4. **Analysis of Provided Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the encoded string `b`.
   - It calls `func_1(b)` to decode the string.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the string `b` back to `s`.

5. **Issues in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is trying to replace characters in `s` directly, but `s` is not being updated correctly.
   - It attempts to insert characters into `unique_chars`, but this approach is incorrect because `unique_chars` should remain fixed and only be used for mapping.
   - The logic for replacing characters in `b` with their symmetric counterparts is flawed.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - First, construct `r` from `b` by identifying the unique characters and sorting them.
   - Then, create a mapping from each character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
   - Finally, use this mapping to decode `b` back to `s`.

Given these issues, the provided code is incorrect because it does not properly decode the string `b` back to `s`.

Correctness: **False**
