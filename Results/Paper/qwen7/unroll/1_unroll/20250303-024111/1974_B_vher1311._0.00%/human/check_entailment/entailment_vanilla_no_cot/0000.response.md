Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding logic. Specifically, the `func_1` function is designed to encode a string, not decode it. To decode, we need to map each character in the encoded string back to its corresponding character in the original string `s`. Here's how you can correct the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = decode_string(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def decode_string(s):
    # Step 1: Create the auxiliary string r with unique characters sorted alphabetically
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    
    # Step 2: Create a mapping from characters in s to their symmetric positions in r
    mapping = {char: unique_chars[len(unique_chars) - 1 - i] for i, char in enumerate(unique_chars)}
    
    # Step 3: Decode the string by replacing each character in s with its mapped character
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    
    return decoded_str
```

This corrected version first creates the auxiliary string `r` with unique characters sorted alphabetically. Then, it creates a mapping from each character in the encoded string `s` to its corresponding character in the original string `s` by finding the symmetric position in `r`. Finally, it decodes the string by replacing each character in `s` with its mapped character.
