Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the encoded string `s` by replacing each character in `s` with its corresponding character from the sorted list of unique characters.
2. However, the implementation of the function is flawed. It attempts to replace characters in `s` directly, but it should instead construct the decoded string based on the mapping between the encoded and decoded characters.
3. The function incorrectly updates the string `s` in place, which can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.
4. The logic for handling characters not present in the initial set of unique characters is also incorrect. Instead of inserting characters into the list, it should map them to their corresponding characters based on the sorted unique characters list.
5. The function returns an empty string because it does not properly construct the decoded string and instead performs operations that do not achieve the desired result.

Given these issues, the provided function does not correctly implement the decoding process.

Correctness: **False**
