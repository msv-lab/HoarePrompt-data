### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to decode a string `b` back to the original string `s`. The string `b` is the result of encoding `s` according to the given rules. The encoding process involves constructing an auxiliary string `r` with all distinct characters of `s` in alphabetical order, and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart from `r`.

2. **Encoding Process Recap**:
   - Construct an auxiliary string `r` with all distinct characters of `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Replace each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart from `r`.

3. **Decoding Process**:
   - To decode, we need to reverse the process.
   - We need to reconstruct the string `r` from `b`.
   - Then, map each character in `b` to its corresponding character in `r`.

4. **Analysis of Provided Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the encoded string `b`.
   - It calls `func_1(b)` to decode the string.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the string `b` back to `s`.

5. **Issues in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is trying to replace characters in `b` directly, but `b` is not being updated correctly.
   - It attempts to insert characters into `unique_chars`, but this approach is incorrect because `unique_chars` should remain fixed and only be used for mapping.
   - The logic for replacing characters in `b` with their symmetric counterparts is flawed.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - First, construct `r` from `b` by identifying the unique characters and sorting them.
   - Then, create a mapping from each character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
   - Finally, use this mapping to decode `b` back to `s`.

The provided code is incorrect because it does not properly decode the string `b` back to `s`. Specifically, the function `func_1` is attempting to modify `s` incorrectly and is not creating the necessary mapping to decode `b`.

### Corrected Code:
Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    char_map = {char: unique_chars[len(unique_chars) - 1 - i] for i, char in enumerate(unique_chars)}
    decoded_str = ''.join(char_map[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

In the corrected code:
- `unique_chars` is constructed from the set of characters in `s` and sorted.
- A dictionary `char_map` is created to map each character in `s` to its symmetric counterpart in `unique_chars`.
- The decoded string `decoded_str` is generated by replacing each character in `s` with its corresponding value in `char_map`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment correctly identified the issues in the provided code. The corrected code addresses these issues and correctly decodes the string `b` back to `s`.

**Final: True**
