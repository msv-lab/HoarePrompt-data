Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as the value of `int(input())` is a non-negative integer. However, since the problem specifies that the initial state of `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, we know that `int(input())` will always return a valid non-negative integer (specifically, `t`).

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing based on the given conditions. Since `t` is already defined and within the specified range, we don't need to change its value. Instead, we need to ensure that the input matches the initial value of `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 78\).

For the loop to execute, the input should match the initial value of `t`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t` being read from the input.

**State:**
**`t` is the initial value of `t`, alphabet is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, and the input must be equal to the initial value of `t`**.
