Reasoning:

1. **Input Processing**: The program correctly reads the input and processes it to count the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' for each scenario. This is done using the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Identifying Undecided Characters**: The program correctly identifies the undecided characters ('?') and categorizes them into two groups (`sa` and `sb`) based on the counts of 'F' and 'S'. This step is crucial for determining where to place 'F' and 'S'.

3. **Decision Making**:
   - If the number of undecided 'F' scenarios is greater than or equal to the number of undecided 'S' scenarios, it places 'F' in the undecided positions.
   - Otherwise, it places 'S' in the undecided positions.
   
4. **Placement Logic**:
   - For undecided characters, the program checks if the current scenario or destination scenario is among the first \(\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \rfloor\) scenarios. If so, it places 'F' or 'S' accordingly.
   - If neither the current scenario nor the destination scenario is among the first \(\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \rfloor\) scenarios, it places the opposite type of transition video.

5. **Output Generation**: The program generates the final transition video plan by iterating through each line and replacing '?' with the determined 'F' or 'S'.

6. **Constraints Satisfaction**: The program ensures that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type appear for any permutation of scenarios.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to follow the problem's requirements correctly and handles all cases as specified.

Correctness: **True**
