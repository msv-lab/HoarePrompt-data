Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24; `a` is a list of length n+1 filled with zeros; `b` is a list of length n+1 filled with zeros; `xx` is a list containing one empty string.**

The code `xx = ['']` assigns a list containing one empty string to the variable `xx`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
