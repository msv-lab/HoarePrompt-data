Output State: `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24; `a` is a list of length n+1 where each element is the count of 'F' received from the corresponding input strings; `b` is a list of length n+1 where each element is the count of 'S' received from the corresponding input strings; `xx` is a list containing n+1 elements, each being a string input from the user with each character either 'F', 'S', or '?'; `sa` is a list containing indices `i` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`; `sb` is a list of length n+1 where each element is a string input from the user. After the loop executes, each element in `xx` has been modified such that any '?' character has been replaced with either 'F' or 'S' based on specific conditions: if the current index `i` (or `j`) is within the first quarter of `sa`, then '?' is replaced with 'F', otherwise it is replaced with 'S'.
