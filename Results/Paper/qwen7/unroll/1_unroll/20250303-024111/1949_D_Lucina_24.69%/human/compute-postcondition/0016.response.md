Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `n` is an input integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).
   - `i` should start from 1 and go up to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 1 initially.
   - `n` must be within the specified range \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24**
