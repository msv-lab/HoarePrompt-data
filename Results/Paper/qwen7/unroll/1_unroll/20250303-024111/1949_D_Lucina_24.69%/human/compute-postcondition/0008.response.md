Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24; `a` is a list of length n+1 where each element is the count of 'F' received from the corresponding input strings; `b` is a list of length n+1 where each element is the count of 'S' received from the corresponding input strings; `xx` is a list containing n+1 elements, each being a string input from the user; `sa` is an empty list; `sb` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `sb`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, or `sa`. Therefore, these variables retain their original states.
