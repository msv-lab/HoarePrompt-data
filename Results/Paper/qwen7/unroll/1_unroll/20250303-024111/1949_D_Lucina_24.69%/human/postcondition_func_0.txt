The function processes an input consisting of n lines, each containing n characters representing the partial transition video plan between scenarios. It counts the occurrences of 'F' (funny) and 'S' (scary) in each line and stores these counts in lists `a` and `b`. Based on the counts, it identifies undecided characters ('?') and replaces them with either 'F' or 'S' according to specific rules. The function ensures that at most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) transition videos are decided. Finally, it prints the modified lines.
