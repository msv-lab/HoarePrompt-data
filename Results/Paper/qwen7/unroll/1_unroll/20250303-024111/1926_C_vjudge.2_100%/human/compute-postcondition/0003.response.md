Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1 (as specified in the range function).
   - `N` is given as 400001.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. Since `i` starts at 1 and `N` is 400001, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 400001.

4. **Adjust the states of the relevant objects**:
   - `i` should be set to 1.
   - `N` should be set to 400001.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `N`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `N` is 400001**
