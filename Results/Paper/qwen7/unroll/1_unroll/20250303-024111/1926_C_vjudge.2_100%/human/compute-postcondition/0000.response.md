Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, N is 400001, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `N` is assigned the value of `int(2 * 100000.0) + 1`, which calculates to `400001`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
