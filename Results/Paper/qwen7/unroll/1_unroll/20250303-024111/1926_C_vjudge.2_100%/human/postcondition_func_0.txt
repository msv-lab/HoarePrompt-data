The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5). For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value.
