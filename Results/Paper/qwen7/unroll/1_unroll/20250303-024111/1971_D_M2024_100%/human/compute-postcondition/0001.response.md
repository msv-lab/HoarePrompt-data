State: **`t` must be greater than 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t` which is used as the range parameter.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
- Since `t` is an input integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), it must be greater than 0 for the loop to run at least once.
- The initial value of `t` being between 1 and 500 (inclusive) already ensures this condition, but we need to explicitly state that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
