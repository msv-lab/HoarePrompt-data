Output State: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `b`, and `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `k` is not equal to 1**.

Explanation: The code `bk = bin(k)[2:]` updates the variable `bk` to be the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix. The other variables (`b`, `k`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
