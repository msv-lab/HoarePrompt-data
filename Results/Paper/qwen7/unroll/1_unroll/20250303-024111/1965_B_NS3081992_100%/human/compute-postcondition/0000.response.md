Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables mentioned in the loop head are `_` and `func_10()`. However, since `_` is a throwaway variable (a common practice when you don't need the value of the loop counter), the focus should be on `func_10()`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a positive integer (since `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and the loop will run for each of these values).

3. **Adjust the State**: Since `func_10()` is not defined within the function and its behavior and inputs are not specified, we cannot directly modify its internal state. However, we can ensure that the return value of `func_10()` is such that the loop can execute.

Given the information provided, the state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`. The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a positive integer.

**State:**
**`func_10()` must return a positive integer**
