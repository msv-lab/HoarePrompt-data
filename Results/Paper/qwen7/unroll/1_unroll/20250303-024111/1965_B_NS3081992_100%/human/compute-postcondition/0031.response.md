Functionality: **The function takes no explicit parameters and returns either the string '1\n2' or a sequence of numbers represented as a string with the length of the sequence followed by the numbers separated by spaces. If \( k \) is 1, it returns '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list based on the binary representations of \( n \) and \( k \), and returns the length and elements of this list.**
