Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence `a` that meets the specified conditions for each test case. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Function Definitions**: The functions defined are not directly used in the main logic, but they are part of the template for handling input and output. This is fine as long as the main function `func_15` is correctly implemented.

2. **Main Function Logic (`func_14`)**:
   - It reads the input values `n` and `k`.
   - It generates a sequence `ans` that satisfies the required conditions.
     - If `k == 1`, it handles a special case where the sequence must include 2 and powers of 2 up to `n`.
     - Otherwise, it constructs the sequence by including powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`, ensuring that all sums from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed, while avoiding a subsequence that sums to `k`.

3. **Output Generation**:
   - The sequence length and the sequence itself are printed in the correct format.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the logic in `func_14` ensures that the generated sequence meets the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
