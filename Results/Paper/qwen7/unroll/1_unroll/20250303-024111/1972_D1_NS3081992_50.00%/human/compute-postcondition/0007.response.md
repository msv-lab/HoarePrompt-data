The function `func_14` accepts four parameters: `a`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. 

- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that `0 <= n <= len(a)` and `1 <= m <= max(a)`.
- `k` is an integer such that `k >= 0`.

The function returns either `1` or `-1`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_14` is to accept a list of integers `a`, two positive integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`, and based on some internal logic, return either `1` or `-1`.
