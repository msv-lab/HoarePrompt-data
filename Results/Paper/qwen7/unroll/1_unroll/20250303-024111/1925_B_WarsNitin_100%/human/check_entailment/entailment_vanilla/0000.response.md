Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which denotes the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 1. This variable will store the maximum balance found.

3. **Loop Over Possible Divisors**:
   - The program uses a loop to iterate over possible divisors `i` from 1 to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`.
     - If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `(x // i)`.

4. **Update Maximum Balance**:
   - If either of the above conditions is met, the program updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the divisor `i` or `x // i`.

5. **Output**:
   - After checking all possible divisors, the program prints the value of `ans`.

### Correctness Analysis

To determine the correctness, we need to verify if the logic correctly finds the maximum balance for each test case.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Divisors Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the remaining difficulty after splitting into `n` sub-problems is divisible by the current divisor `i` or `x // i`.
   
2. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The balance is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems. Since the program is checking if the remaining difficulty is divisible by the divisor, it indirectly ensures that the GCD is at least the divisor.

3. **Optimality**:
   - The program iterates over all divisors up to the square root of `x`, ensuring it covers all possible ways to split the difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where `x` is not perfectly divisible by `n` or when `n` is large compared to `x`.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum balance.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance for each test case based on the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
