You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import sqrt

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of `n` sub-problems whose sum equals `x`.

2. **Approach Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over potential divisors of `x` using a loop from `1` to `sqrt(x)`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, it updates `ans` if `i` is greater.
     - If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `x // i`, it updates `ans` if `x // i` is greater.
   
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is a multiple of `n` by checking both `i` and `x // i`.
   - It ensures that the sub-problems' difficulties are positive integers and their sum equals `x`.

4. **GCD Maximization**:
   - By iterating up to `sqrt(x)`, the program efficiently finds the largest possible GCD.
   - The conditions ensure that the sum of the sub-problems' difficulties equals `x`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum GCD found for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance (GCD) of the sub-problems' difficulties. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem's requirements accurately.
