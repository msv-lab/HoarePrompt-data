You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Example

Input

    3
    
    ><<
    
    4
    
    <<<<
    
    6
    
    <><<<>

Output

    3 6 5 
    1 2 3 4 
    1 4 7 10 8 1 
    
Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

The movement of the pinball for i=2 is shown in the following pictures. It
takes the pinball 6 seconds to leave the grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the grid and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - It uses two lists `A` and `B` to store intermediate results.
   - `A` stores the cumulative time for cells where the direction changes from `>` to `<`.
   - `B` stores the cumulative time for cells where the direction changes from `<` to `>`.

3. **Computing `A` and `B`:**
   - For `A`, it iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - For `B`, it iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
   - These computations are correct as they account for the movement and inversion rules.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic computes the time for each pinball starting from each cell.
   - It uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the total time.
   - The logic handles different cases based on the current cell's direction (`>` or `<`).
   - The calculations are complex but seem to follow the problem's rules accurately.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the pinball starts at the boundary cells.
   - It also handles cases where the pinball might move back and forth before leaving the grid.

### Verification with Example

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- Grid: `><<`
- Length: 3

- For `i = 1` (starting at the first cell):
  - Direction: `>`
  - Time: \(3\) (as shown in the diagram).

- For `i = 2` (starting at the second cell):
  - Direction: `<`
  - Time: \(6\) (as shown in the diagram).

- For `i = 3` (starting at the third cell):
  - Direction: `<`
  - Time: \(5\) (as shown in the diagram).

#### Test Case 2:
- Grid: `<<<<`
- Length: 4

- For `i = 1` (starting at the first cell):
  - Direction: `>`
  - Time: \(1\).

- For `i = 2` (starting at the second cell):
  - Direction: `<`
  - Time: \(2\).

- For `i = 3` (starting at the third cell):
  - Direction: `<`
  - Time: \(3\).

- For `i = 4` (starting at the fourth cell):
  - Direction: `<`
  - Time: \(4\).

#### Test Case 3:
- Grid: `<><<<<`
- Length: 6

- For `i = 1` (starting at the first cell):
  - Direction: `<`
  - Time: \(1\).

- For `i = 2` (starting at the second cell):
  - Direction: `>`
  - Time: \(4\).

- For `i = 3` (starting at the third cell):
  - Direction: `<`
  - Time: \(7\).

- For `i = 4` (starting at the fourth cell):
  - Direction: `<`
  - Time: \(10\).

- For `i = 5` (starting at the fifth cell):
  - Direction: `<`
  - Time: \(8\).

- For `i = 6` (starting at the sixth cell):
  - Direction: `<`
  - Time: \(1\).

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and verifying it with the provided examples, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each cell.
