Output State: **`l` is 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters '<' and '>', `A` remains the same as initially, `idx_A` remains the same as initially, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `B` contains the cumulative distances from each '<' character to the nearest '>' character, calculated in reverse order, `r` is the length of `B`.**

Explanation: The code `r = len(B)` calculates the length of the list `B` and assigns it to the variable `r`. The values of `l`, `s`, `A`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged. `r` now holds the number of elements in `B`.
