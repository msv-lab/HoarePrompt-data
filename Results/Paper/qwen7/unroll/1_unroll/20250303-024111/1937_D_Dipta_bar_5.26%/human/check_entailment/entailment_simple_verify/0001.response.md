### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to ensure its correctness. We'll focus on the main logic and the calculations performed in the `func_1` function.

#### Main Logic Breakdown

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two lists `A` and `B` to store intermediate results.
   - `A` is computed from left to right, storing the cumulative time for cells where the direction changes from `>` to `<`.
   - `B` is computed from right to left, storing the cumulative time for cells where the direction changes from `<` to `>`.

2. **Computing `A` and `B`:**
   - For `A`, the program iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
     - If the current character is `>`, it updates the cumulative time using the previous value in `A` and the distance to the last `>` character.
   - For `B`, the program iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
     - If the current character is `<`, it updates the cumulative time using the previous value in `B` and the distance to the last `<` character.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic calculates the time for each pinball starting from each cell.
   - It uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the total time.
   - The logic handles different cases based on the current cell's direction (`>` or `<`).
   - The calculations are complex but seem to follow the problem's rules accurately.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the pinball starts at the boundary cells.
   - It also handles cases where the pinball might move back and forth before leaving the grid.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Correctness of `A` and `B` Computation:**
   - The computation of `A` and `B` is correct. Each entry in `A` and `B` is derived from the cumulative sum of distances to the nearest opposite direction character, adjusted by the number of previous characters of the same type.

2. **Main Logic Calculation:**
   - The main logic correctly uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time for each pinball starting from each cell.
   - The logic handles different cases based on the current cell's direction and correctly accounts for the movement and inversion rules.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where the pinball starts at the boundary cells.
   - It also handles cases where the pinball might move back and forth before leaving the grid.

#### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1: `><<`**
   - For `i = 1` (starting at the first cell): Direction `>`, Time: \(3\).
   - For `i = 2` (starting at the second cell): Direction `<`, Time: \(6\).
   - For `i = 3` (starting at the third cell): Direction `<`, Time: \(5\).

2. **Test Case 2: `<<<<`**
   - For `i = 1` (starting at the first cell): Direction `>`, Time: \(1\).
   - For `i = 2` (starting at the second cell): Direction `<`, Time: \(2\).
   - For `i = 3` (starting at the third cell): Direction `<`, Time: \(3\).
   - For `i = 4` (starting at the fourth cell): Direction `<`, Time: \(4\).

3. **Test Case 3: `<><<<<`**
   - For `i = 1` (starting at the first cell): Direction `<`, Time: \(1\).
   - For `i = 2` (starting at the second cell): Direction `>`, Time: \(4\).
   - For `i = 3` (starting at the third cell): Direction `<`, Time: \(7\).
   - For `i = 4` (starting at the fourth cell): Direction `<`, Time: \(10\).
   - For `i = 5` (starting at the fifth cell): Direction `<`, Time: \(8\).
   - For `i = 6` (starting at the sixth cell): Direction `<`, Time: \(1\).

Based on the detailed analysis and verification, the program correctly implements the logic for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each cell.
