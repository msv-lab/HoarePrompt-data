Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided in the loop body. Specifically, for each test case, if \(B \times 2 < C\), it prints \(A \times B\); if \(A\) is even, it prints \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\); otherwise, it prints \(\frac{A}{2} \times C + B\). The number of integers printed will be equal to the number of test cases specified by the first input integer \(t\).
