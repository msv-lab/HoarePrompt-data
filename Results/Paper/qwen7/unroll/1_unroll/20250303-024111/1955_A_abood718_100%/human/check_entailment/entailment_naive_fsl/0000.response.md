Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where buying in pairs using the promotion price is more cost-effective than buying individually, especially when the number of yogurts is odd. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `3 5 11`
- Expected Output: `15` (since buying 3 yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them individually)

However, the program's logic does not account for this scenario correctly. It checks if `B * 2 < C` and prints `A * B` if true, which is incorrect because it does not consider the promotion price for an odd number of yogurts. Additionally, the logic for handling an odd number of yogurts (`A % 2 == 0`) is also flawed. 

To fix this, the program should calculate the cost of buying as many pairs as possible using the promotion price and then add the remaining individual yogurts at the regular price. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        singles = n % 2
        total_cost = pairs * b + singles * a
        print(total_cost)
```

This corrected function ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly for any number of yogurts.
