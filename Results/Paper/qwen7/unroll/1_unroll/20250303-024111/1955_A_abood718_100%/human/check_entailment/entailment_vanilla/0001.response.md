Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion vs Regular Price Comparison:**
   - The program checks if the price for two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the price for one yogurt (`B * 2`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them at the regular price.
       - In this case, the program prints `A * B`, which is incorrect because it should be printing `A * C / 2`.
     - If `B * 2 >= C`, it means buying two yogurts at the promotion price is not cheaper.
       - The program then checks if `A` is even.
         - If `A` is even, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is correct.
         - If `A` is odd, it calculates the cost as follows:
           - It buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible using the promotion (`X = A // 2`).
           - It then adds the cost of the remaining yogurt at the regular price (`B`).

3. **Cost Calculation for Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - The logic for calculating the cost when `A` is odd is correct. It buys as many pairs as possible using the promotion and then adds the cost of the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly handles the scenario where `A` is even and prints the minimum cost.
- However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost when `B * 2 < C`. Instead of printing `A * B`, it should print `A * C / 2`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it prints `A * B` instead of `A * C / 2` when `B * 2 < C`.
