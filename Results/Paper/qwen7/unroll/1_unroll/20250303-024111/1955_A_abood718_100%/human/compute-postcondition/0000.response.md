Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`. Therefore, the loop will start and continue as long as the input is valid and non-zero.

3. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The value of `int(input())` is not known until the user inputs it, but we know it must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, it does not need adjustment.
   - The value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the constraints, the initial state of `int(input())` must be an integer within the specified range (1 to \(10^4\)).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `int(input())`, ensuring it is a valid starting point for the loop.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`int(input())` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\)**
