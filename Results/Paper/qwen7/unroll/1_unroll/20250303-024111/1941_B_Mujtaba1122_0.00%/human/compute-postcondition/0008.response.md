The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `list`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and `n`, which is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Each element in the list is an integer in the range [0, 10^9]. The function returns a value based on the elements in the list and the integer `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer n, and returns a value based on the elements in the list and the integer n.**
