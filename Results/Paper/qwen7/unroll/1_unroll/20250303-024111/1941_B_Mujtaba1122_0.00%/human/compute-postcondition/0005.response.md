Postcondition: **The list remains unchanged, and for every element at index `i` (where `1 < i < n-1`), if `list[i]` was not greater than 1 or either `list[i-1]` or `list[i+1]` was not greater than 0, then the list remains as it was before the operation. Elements outside the range `[1, n-2]` also remain unchanged unless they are affected by the conditions inside the loop.**
