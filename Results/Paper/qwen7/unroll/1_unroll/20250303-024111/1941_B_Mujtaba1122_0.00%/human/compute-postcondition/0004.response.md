Based on the initial state provided, the precondition does not give us any specific values for the list or the length `n`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values that will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement. However, the statement itself is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any variables or objects within the list.

Output: **YES**
