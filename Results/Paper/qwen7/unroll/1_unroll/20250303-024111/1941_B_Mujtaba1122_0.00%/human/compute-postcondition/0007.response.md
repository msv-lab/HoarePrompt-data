Postcondition: **For every element at index `i` (where `1 < i < n-1`), if `list[i]` was initially greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` were greater than 0, then `list[i]` is reduced by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i-1]` is reduced by itself, and `list[i+1]` is reduced by the value of `list[i-1]`. After all possible reductions according to these conditions, the remaining values in the list will reflect these changes. Elements outside the range `[1, n-2]` will remain unchanged unless they are affected by the conditions inside the loop. The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `True` if the above transformations were applied successfully. If the transformations were not applied (i.e., `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`), the list remains unchanged.**
