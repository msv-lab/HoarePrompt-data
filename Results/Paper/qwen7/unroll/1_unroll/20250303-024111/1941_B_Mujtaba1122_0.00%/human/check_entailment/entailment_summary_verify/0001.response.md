### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis again to confirm the correctness of the program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2.
   - For each index `i`, it performs the operation as long as:
     - `list[i] > 1`
     - `list[i - 1] > 0`
     - `list[i + 1] > 0`
   - The operation modifies the array as follows:
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Operation Validity**:
   - The operation defined in `func_2` is valid according to the problem statement.
   - Each operation reduces the value of `a_i` by 2 and the adjacent values by 1, which is consistent with the problem constraints.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge cases where the array might have zeros initially or after some operations.
   - The loop in `func_2` ensures that the operation is only performed when the conditions are met, preventing invalid operations.

3. **Final Check**:
   - The final check using `func_1` is necessary to ensure that all elements are indeed zero after the operations.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1**: `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`
  - Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`
  - Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`
  - Apply the operation at `i=2`: `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`
  - Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - Output: `YES`

- **Test Case 2**: `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`
  - No sequence of operations can reduce all elements to zero.
  - Output: `NO`

- **Test Case 3**: `[0, 1, 3, 3, 1]`
  - Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[0, 1, 2, 2, 1]`
  - Apply the operation at `i=2`: `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]`
  - Output: `NO`

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: True**

The original assessment is accurate.
