Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. The function `func_2` does not properly simulate the operations and does not correctly check if it's possible to make all elements zero. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Operation Simulation**: The while loop in `func_2` attempts to perform the operation repeatedly while certain conditions are met, but it does not correctly decrement the elements as required. Specifically, the lines:
   ```python
   list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
   list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
   list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
   ```
   are incorrect because they do not reflect the actual decrementing process. The correct decrement should be based on the value of `list[i]`, not `list[i-1]`.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle edge cases where the array might not allow any operations to make all elements zero. For instance, if the array has elements that cannot be reduced to zero through the allowed operations, the program should still output 'NO'.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to ensure that the operations are applied correctly and that the final state of the array can be checked accurately. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_make_zero(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is even
        if sum(a) % 2 != 0:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # Check if the minimum element is non-positive
        min_val = min(a)
        if min_val < 0:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # Check if the maximum element is non-zero and the rest can be made zero
        max_val = max(a)
        if max_val > 0:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        print("YES")

# Example usage
t = int(input().strip())
can_make_zero(t)
```

This solution checks if the sum of the array is even, if the minimum element is non-positive, and if the maximum element is non-zero and the rest can be made zero, which ensures the conditions for making all elements zero are met.
