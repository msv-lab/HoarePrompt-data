Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_2` correctly determines if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Operation Analysis**: The operation allows reducing three consecutive elements in a specific way:
   - \(a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1\)
   - \(a_i = a_i - 2\)
   - \(a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1\)

2. **Transformation Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The function iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2 (inclusive).
   - For each element at index i, if the element is greater than 1 and both adjacent elements are greater than 0, it applies the operation.
   - This process continues until no further operations can be applied.

3. **Final Check with `func_1`**:
   - After all possible operations, the function checks if all elements in the array are zero using `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it means all elements are zero, and the function prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Edge Cases and Validation**:
   - The problem constraints ensure that the array size and values are within reasonable limits.
   - The transformation logic in `func_2` correctly simulates the allowed operations and ensures that the array can only reach a state where all elements are zero if such a sequence of operations exists.

Given the logical consistency and the validation through `func_1`, the implementation in `func_2` should correctly determine if it's possible to make all elements zero.

Correctness: **True**
