### Reasoning

The original assessment accurately describes the functionality and correctness of the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly checks if all elements in the list are zero. If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2 and applies the specified operation as long as the conditions are met.
   - The operation modifies the array by reducing `a_i` by 2, `a_{i-1}` by 1, and `a_{i+1}` by 1.
   - After applying all possible operations, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge cases where the array might have zeros initially or after some operations.
   - The loop in `func_2` ensures that the operation is only performed when the conditions are met, preventing invalid operations.

4. **Final Check**:
   - The final check using `func_1` is necessary to ensure that all elements are indeed zero after the operations.

5. **Example Walkthrough**:
   - The provided examples in the original assessment correctly demonstrate how the program works for different scenarios.

Given the detailed analysis and the walkthrough of the examples, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations.
