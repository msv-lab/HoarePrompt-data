Output State: The output state consists of the values of `d1` and `d2` dictionaries computed for each test case, followed by the results of `m` queries for each test case. For each query, the output is the difference between the values of `d1` or `d2` at indices `y` and `x`, depending on whether `y` is greater than `x`.
