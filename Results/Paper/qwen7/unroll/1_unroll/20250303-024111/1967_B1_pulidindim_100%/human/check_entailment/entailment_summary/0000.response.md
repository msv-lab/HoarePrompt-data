Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Let's break down the requirements and the provided code:

1. **Problem Requirements**: We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
   - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
   - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
   - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`.
   - It uses a while loop to increment `count` and calculates `g` as `int(n / count)`.
   - If `g` is less than `count - 1`, it breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates `ans` by adding `int(g / count) + 1`.
   - Finally, it prints the result.

3. **Algorithm Verification**:
   - The algorithm seems to be attempting to count valid pairs \((a, b)\) by iterating over possible values of \(b\) and calculating how many valid \(a\) values exist for each \(b\).
   - However, the logic inside the while loop does not directly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it makes assumptions about the distribution of valid \(a\) values based on the division of \(n\) by `count`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the required logic. Specifically, it does not properly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The example outputs provided do not match the expected results for the given problem statement. For instance, the output for the test case \( (10, 8) \) should be 14, but the code produces a different result.

Given these observations, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
