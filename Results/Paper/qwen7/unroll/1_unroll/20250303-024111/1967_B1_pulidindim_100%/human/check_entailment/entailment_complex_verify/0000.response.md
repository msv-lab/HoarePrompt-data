### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

#### Key Points from the Annotated Code:
1. **Initialization**: The variable `count` starts at 2 and iterates up to `m`.
2. **Calculation of `g`**: `g` is calculated as `int(n / count)`. This seems to be an attempt to reduce `n` by multiples of `count`.
3. **Condition Check**: If `g < countmins`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
4. **Update `ans`**: `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1`.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates from 2 to `m`, which is incorrect because `a` can be any value from 1 to `n`. The loop should iterate over possible values of `a` directly.
2. **Calculation of `g`**: The calculation of `g` as `int(n / count)` does not seem to be relevant to the problem. It appears to be an attempt to simplify `n` but does not align with the problem's requirements.
3. **Condition Check**: The condition `g < countmins` is not relevant to the problem. It does not check the actual condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
4. **Update `ans`**: The update of `ans` by adding `int(g / count) + 1` is not aligned with the problem's requirements. It does not account for the actual pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The logic used to calculate the number of valid pairs does not accurately reflect the conditions specified in the problem description.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for at least one potential case, making it incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
