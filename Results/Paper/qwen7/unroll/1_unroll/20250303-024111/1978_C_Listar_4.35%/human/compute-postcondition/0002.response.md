Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is explicitly given as 0.
- `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\).
- The line `n, k = func_2()` has been called, but the details of `func_2()` are not provided. However, since `n` is already explicitly given as 0, the value of `n` will remain 0 regardless of the return value of `func_2()`. The value of `k` could change, but it does not affect the print statement directly.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
