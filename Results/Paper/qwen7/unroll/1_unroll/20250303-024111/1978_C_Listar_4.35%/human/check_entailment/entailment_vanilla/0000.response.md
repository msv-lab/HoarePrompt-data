Let's analyze the given code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \).
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |p_i - i| \).

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function checks if a solution exists.
   - It returns `(0, 0)` if no solution exists.
   - If \( n \) is odd, the maximum possible Manhattan value is \(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\).
   - If \( n \) is even, the maximum possible Manhattan value is \(\frac{n^2}{2}\).
   - If \( k \) exceeds these maximum values, it returns `(0, 0)`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function constructs the permutation.
   - It starts with a list of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It iteratively moves the last element to the front until the required Manhattan value is achieved.
   - The logic seems to decrement \( k \) by the index positions as it moves elements.

4. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation.
   - It takes a list `l` as input and prints it.

5. **Function `func_4`:**
   - This function orchestrates the process.
   - It calls `func_2` to check if a solution exists.
   - If a solution exists, it calls `func_1` to construct the permutation and then `func_3` to print it.
   - If no solution exists, it prints "NO".

### Testing and Edge Cases

1. **Edge Case: \( n = 1 \), \( k = 1 \):**
   - The only permutation is `[1]`, and the Manhattan value is \( |1 - 1| = 0 \).
   - The function should return "NO" because \( k = 1 \) cannot be achieved.

2. **Edge Case: \( n = 1 \), \( k = 0 \):**
   - The only permutation is `[1]`, and the Manhattan value is \( |1 - 1| = 0 \).
   - The function should return "YES" with the permutation `[1]`.

3. **General Case:**
   - For larger \( n \) and \( k \), the function should correctly construct a permutation if one exists.

### Conclusion

The code has some logical issues:
- The function `func_1` does not handle all cases correctly, especially when \( k \) is large.
- The function `func_2` correctly identifies when a solution is impossible, but the construction in `func_1` might fail to find a valid permutation.

Given these issues, the code is not fully correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
