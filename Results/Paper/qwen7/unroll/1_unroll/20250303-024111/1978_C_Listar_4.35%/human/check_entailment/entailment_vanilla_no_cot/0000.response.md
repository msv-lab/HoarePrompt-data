To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze each function and how they work together to solve the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
This function checks if the given `k` can be achieved for a permutation of length `n`. It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` cannot be achieved, otherwise it returns `(n, k)`.

- **Edge Cases**: 
  - If `k` is odd, it immediately returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even.
  - If `n` is odd, the maximum possible Manhattan value is \((n^2 - 1) / 2\).
  - If `n` is even, the maximum possible Manhattan value is \(n^2 / 2\).

### Analysis of `func_1`:
This function generates a permutation that achieves the given `k`.

- **Key Logic**:
  - It starts by creating a list of numbers from 1 to `n`.
  - It then iteratively moves the last element to a position where the Manhattan value is reduced by the current index.
  - This process continues until `k` becomes zero.

### Analysis of `func_3`:
This function prints the result in the required format.

- **Key Logic**:
  - It prints "YES" followed by the permutation.
  - It handles the printing of the permutation correctly.

### Analysis of `func_4`:
This function integrates the other functions to solve the problem.

- **Key Logic**:
  - It calls `func_2` to check if `k` can be achieved.
  - If `k` can be achieved, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and `func_3` to print the result.
  - If `k` cannot be achieved, it prints "NO".

### Overall Correctness:
- The logic in `func_2` correctly identifies whether `k` can be achieved for a given `n`.
- The logic in `func_1` correctly generates a permutation that achieves the given `k`.
- The logic in `func_3` correctly formats and prints the result.
- The integration in `func_4` ensures that the entire process is handled correctly.

Given the analysis, the provided program seems to correctly solve the problem according to the problem statement and constraints.

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **True**
