Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and `l` is the return value of `func_1(n, k)`**.

Explanation: The code `l = func_1(n, k)` calls the function `func_1` with arguments `n` and `k`, and assigns the return value of this function call to the variable `l`. Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we can only state that `l` now holds whatever value `func_1(n, k)` returns. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
