Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and for each iteration of the loop, `n` is an integer read from input, `nums` is a list of integers read from input, and the loop prints the sum of the second largest number in `nums` and the last number in `nums`. After all iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, but the printed outputs are the sums calculated for each input list `nums`.
