State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will run `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), but this alone does not guarantee that the loop will execute.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be explicitly adjusted to be greater than 0.

Since the loop head does not include any other variables or states, the only thing that needs adjustment is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.
