Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the function `func()` is flawed because it simply takes the last element of the list and adds it to the second-largest element in the list (all but the last element). This approach does not guarantee that the books are divided into two non-empty piles such that the sum of the maximum books in each pile is maximized.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider all possible ways to split the books into two piles and then find the combination that gives the maximum sum of the maximum books in each pile. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)
        max_pages = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            max_pages = max(max_pages, nums[i-1] + nums[i])
        results.append(max_pages)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of books and their page counts.
3. It sorts the list of page counts in descending order.
4. It iterates through the sorted list, considering each possible split point between the two piles.
5. It calculates the sum of the maximum books in each pile for each split and keeps track of the maximum sum found.
6. Finally, it prints the maximum sum for each test case.
