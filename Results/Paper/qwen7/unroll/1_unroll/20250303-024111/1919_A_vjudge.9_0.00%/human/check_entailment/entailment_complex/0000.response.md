Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The game is played optimally by both players, and the player who cannot make a valid move loses.
2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even.
   - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, and calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner.
   - It stores the results in a list and prints them out.
4. **Game Logic**:
   - The game involves alternating moves where a player can either swap wallets or remove a coin from their current wallet.
   - The key observation is that the parity (even or odd nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`) determines the winner:
     - If `a + b` is even, Bob wins because he can always force the total to become odd after his move, ensuring Alice eventually faces an empty wallet.
     - If `a + b` is odd, Alice wins because she can always force the total to become even after her move, ensuring Bob eventually faces an empty wallet.
5. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of `a + b`.
   - The implementation in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
