Reasoning:
1. The problem involves determining the winner of a game based on the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
2. The game rules are as follows:
   - Players take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them.
   - After each turn, a player removes one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
3. The key observation here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner:
   - If the sum of the coins is even, Bob wins.
   - If the sum of the coins is odd, Alice wins.
4. This is because:
   - When the sum is even, the first player (Alice) will always face an even sum after removing a coin, which means Bob will face an odd sum when it's his turn.
   - Conversely, when the sum is odd, the first player (Alice) will always face an odd sum after removing a coin, which means Bob will face an even sum when it's his turn.
5. The provided code correctly implements this logic:
   - `func_1` checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even and returns 'Bob' or 'Alice' accordingly.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1` and printing the results.
6. Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the code accurately determines the winner based on the sum of the coins being even or odd.

Correctness: **True**
