The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (length of two string arrays), and two strings \( a \) and \( b \) (each of length \( n \), containing only '<' or '>'). For each test case, it checks if it's possible to move from the first row to the second row following the arrows represented by the characters in \( a \) and \( b \) without any conflicts. If a conflict is found, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes' after checking all test cases.
