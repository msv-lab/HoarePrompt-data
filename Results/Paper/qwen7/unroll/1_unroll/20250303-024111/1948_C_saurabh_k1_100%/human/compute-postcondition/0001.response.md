Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: According to the problem statement, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

3. **Check the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer input, it will always be a non-negative integer (either positive or zero). However, if `t` is 0, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
