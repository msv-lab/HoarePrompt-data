### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's reiterate and provide a detailed breakdown of why the given program is incorrect.

1. **Problem Constraints and Movement:**
   - The robot starts at `(1, 1)` and must reach `(2, n)`.
   - The robot can only move left, right, up, or down, but it always follows the arrow in the current cell.
   - The program only checks if certain conditions are met at odd-indexed columns, which is insufficient to determine the robot's path.

2. **Key Issues:**
   - **Odd-Indexed Columns Check:** The program only checks odd-indexed columns, which means it skips even-indexed columns entirely. This is problematic because the robot's movement depends on both the current and the next column's arrows.
   - **Movement Logic:** The logic assumes that if an arrow points left or right, the robot will move accordingly. However, the program does not account for the actual movement path the robot takes, only checking if certain conditions are met at specific columns.
   - **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle cases where the robot can move to the next row and follow the arrows correctly. It only checks if the arrows align in a specific pattern at certain columns, which is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - **Example 1:** `n = 4`, `a = ">><<", b = ">>><`
     - The robot starts at `(1, 1)` and follows the arrows.
     - The robot can move to `(1, 2)` (right), then `(1, 3)` (left), then `(2, 3)` (down), and finally `(2, 4)` (right).
     - The program would correctly identify this path and print 'YES'.
   - **Example 2:** `n = 2`, `a = "><", b = "><`
     - The robot starts at `(1, 1)` and follows the arrows.
     - The robot can move to `(2, 1)` (down), then `(2, 2)` (right).
     - The program would correctly identify this path and print 'YES'.
   - **Example 3:** `n = 4`, `a = ">>><", b = ">><<`
     - The robot starts at `(1, 1)` and follows the arrows.
     - The robot can move to `(1, 2)` (right), then `(1, 3)` (right), then `(2, 3)` (down), and finally `(2, 4)` (left).
     - The program incorrectly prints 'NO' because it only checks odd-indexed columns.
   - **Example 4:** `n = 6`, `a = ">><<><", b = "><>>><`
     - The robot starts at `(1, 1)` and follows the arrows.
     - The robot can move to `(1, 2)` (right), then `(1, 3)` (left), then `(2, 3)` (down), then `(2, 4)` (right), then `(1, 4)` (up), then `(1, 5)` (right), then `(2, 5)` (down), and finally `(2, 6)` (right).
     - The program would correctly identify this path and print 'YES'.

Given these examples and the analysis, the original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.
