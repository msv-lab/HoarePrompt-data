Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even), and two strings of length `n` where each character is either '<' or '>'. For each test case, the function determines and returns whether it's possible to move from the first row to the second row following the arrows without any conflicts.**

Note: The actual logic to determine the possibility of moving from the first row to the second row is not described here, as per the instruction to avoid detailing how the function operates.
