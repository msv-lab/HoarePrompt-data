Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4; for each value of `t`, there are `n` values read from input where `1 <= n <= 10^4`, and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. After executing the loop, for each `t`, if any condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is met for any odd index `i` in the range 1 to `n-1`, the output is 'No', otherwise, the output is 'Yes'.
