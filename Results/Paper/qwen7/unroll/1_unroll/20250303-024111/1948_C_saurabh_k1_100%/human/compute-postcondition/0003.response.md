Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4; for each value of `t`, there is a corresponding `n` and two strings `a` and `b` such that after executing the loop, if for every `n` and corresponding `a`, `b`, the condition `i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is never met for any odd index `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`, then 'yes' is printed; otherwise, 'No' is printed for that particular `n`, `a`, and `b`.
