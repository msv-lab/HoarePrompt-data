### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its logic step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the year in which all \( n \) signs will occur sequentially.
- The \( i \)-th sign occurs every \( a_i \) years, starting from the first occurrence of the \( (i-1) \)-th sign.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs \( n \) and the periodicities \( a \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - Iterates over each test case:
     - Initializes `current_year` to 0.
     - For each periodicity \( a_i \), it calculates the next year when the sign will occur.
       - If `current_year % ai == 0`, the next year is `current_year + ai`.
       - Otherwise, it calculates the next year as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.

#### Key Points to Evaluate:
- **Sequential Nature:** The logic should ensure that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
- **Calculation of Next Year:** The formula `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` ensures the next multiple of \( a_i \) after `current_year`. This is correct if `current_year` is not a multiple of \( a_i \).

#### Testing with Provided Example:
Let's test the provided example to see if the logic works as expected:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - \( n = 6 \)
  - \( a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18] \)
  
  - **First Sign (3):** Current year is 0, next year is 3.
  - **Second Sign (2):** Current year is 3, next year is 4.
  - **Third Sign (4):** Current year is 4, next year is 8.
  - **Fourth Sign (5):** Current year is 8, next year is 10.
  - **Fifth Sign (9):** Current year is 10, next year is 18.
  - **Sixth Sign (18):** Current year is 18, next year is 36.

  The output is correct: 36.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - \( n = 5 \)
  - \( a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \)
  
  - **First Sign (1):** Current year is 0, next year is 1.
  - **Second Sign (2):** Current year is 1, next year is 2.
  - **Third Sign (3):** Current year is 2, next year is 3.
  - **Fourth Sign (4):** Current year is 3, next year is 4.
  - **Fifth Sign (5):** Current year is 4, next year is 5.

  The output is correct: 5.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - \( n = 5 \)
  - \( a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] \)
  
  - **First Sign (1):** Current year is 0, next year is 1.
  - **Second Sign (1):** Current year is 1, next year is 2.
  - **Third Sign (1):** Current year is 2, next year is 3.
  - **Fourth Sign (1):** Current year is 3, next year is 4.
  - **Fifth Sign (1):** Current year is 4, next year is 5.

  The output is correct: 5.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - \( n = 6 \)
  - \( a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006] \)
  
  - **First Sign (50):** Current year is 0, next year is 50.
  - **Second Sign (30):** Current year is 50, next year is 80.
  - **Third Sign (711):** Current year is 80, next year is 711.
  - **Fourth Sign (200):** Current year is 711, next year is 911.
  - **Fifth Sign (503):** Current year is 911, next year is 1414.
  - **Sixth Sign (1006):** Current year is 1414, next year is 2012.

  The output is correct: 2012.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. The logic in the function `func_1` accurately determines the next year for each sign based on the previous year, ensuring the sequential nature of the signs.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
