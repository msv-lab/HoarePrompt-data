Output State: **The program returns a list of integers where each integer represents the final value of `current_year` after executing the inner loop for the given list of integers `a`, starting from `current_year = 0` for each test case.**

This means that for each test case (each list of integers `a`), the program starts with `current_year` set to 0 and then executes an inner loop, but since no specific inner loop logic is provided, we can only describe the general state of the variable `results` which will contain the final value of `current_year` for each test case.
