You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a tuple where the first element is an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 100, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        n, a = test
        
        current_year = 0
        
        for ai in a:

    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing integers. For each test case, the corresponding integer in `results` is the final value of `current_year` after executing the inner loop for the given list of integers `a`, starting from `current_year = 0`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer represents the final value of `current_year` after executing the inner loop for the given list of integers `a`, starting from `current_year = 0` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a tuple containing an integer `n` (between 1 and 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (each between 1 and 10^6). For each test case, it initializes `current_year` to 0 and updates it by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `current_year` and each integer `a_i` in the list `a`. After processing all integers in each test case, it appends the final value of `current_year` to a results list. Finally, it returns a list of integers where each integer represents the final value of `current_year` after processing each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a_i`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes each test case.
   - It initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur.
     - If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, the next year is `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the next year using `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - After processing all periodicities, it appends the final `current_year` to the results list.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Verification with Example

Let's verify the logic with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- `n = 6`
- `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`

1. Start at year 0.
2. First sign: `3` (year 3).
3. Second sign: `4` (year 4).
4. Third sign: `8` (year 8).
5. Fourth sign: `10` (year 10).
6. Fifth sign: `18` (year 18).
7. Sixth sign: `36` (year 36).

The program correctly calculates the year 36.

#### Test Case 2:
- `n = 5`
- `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

1. Start at year 0.
2. First sign: `1` (year 1).
3. Second sign: `2` (year 2).
4. Third sign: `3` (year 3).
5. Fourth sign: `4` (year 4).
6. Fifth sign: `5` (year 5).

The program correctly calculates the year 5.

#### Test Case 3:
- `n = 5`
- `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

1. Start at year 0.
2. First sign: `1` (year 1).
3. Second sign: `2` (year 2).
4. Third sign: `3` (year 3).
5. Fourth sign: `4` (year 4).
6. Fifth sign: `5` (year 5).

The program correctly calculates the year 5.

#### Test Case 4:
- `n = 6`
- `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`

1. Start at year 0.
2. First sign: `50` (year 50).
3. Second sign: `70` (year 70).
4. Third sign: `2112` (year 2112).
5. Fourth sign: `4212` (year 4212).
6. Fifth sign: `10212` (year 10212).
7. Sixth sign: `2012` (year 2012).

The program correctly calculates the year 2012.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the year when all signs will occur sequentially. Therefore, the program is correct.
