The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a tuple containing an integer `n` (between 1 and 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (each between 1 and 10^6). For each test case, it initializes `current_year` to 0 and updates it by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `current_year` and each integer `a_i` in the list `a`. After processing all integers in each test case, it appends the final value of `current_year` to a results list. Finally, it returns a list of integers where each integer represents the final value of `current_year` after processing each test case.
