### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to evaluate its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires finding the year in which all \( n \) signs will occur sequentially. This means we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the sequence of years as each sign occurs. The LCM of a sequence of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the numbers in the sequence.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` processes each test case and calculates the year in which all signs will occur.
- It initializes `current_year` to 0 and updates it by finding the LCM of `current_year` and each integer `a_i` in the list `a`.
- The logic for updating `current_year` seems to be attempting to find the next year when the next sign will occur, but it might not be correctly implementing the LCM calculation.

#### Code Analysis:
Let's break down the code step-by-step:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        (n, a) = test
        current_year = 0
        for ai in a:
            if current_year % ai == 0:
                next_year = current_year + ai
            else:
                next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
            current_year = next_year
        results.append(current_year)
    return results
```

1. **Initialization**: `current_year` is initialized to 0.
2. **Loop through each sign**: For each sign with periodicity `ai`:
   - If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next year is `current_year + ai`.
   - Otherwise, the next year is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.

This logic is flawed because it does not correctly compute the LCM. Instead, it tries to incrementally find the next year by adding `ai` to `current_year` if it is a multiple, or by finding the next multiple of `ai` otherwise. This approach does not guarantee that the LCM is being computed correctly.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly find the LCM of a sequence of numbers, we can use the following approach:
1. Initialize `current_year` to 1.
2. For each `ai` in the sequence, update `current_year` to the LCM of `current_year` and `ai`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        (n, a) = test
        current_year = 1
        for ai in a:
            current_year = lcm(current_year, ai)
        results.append(current_year)
    return results
```

This version correctly computes the LCM of the sequence of numbers, ensuring that the next year when the next sign will occur is correctly determined.

#### Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the LCM, leading to incorrect results.

**Final: False**
