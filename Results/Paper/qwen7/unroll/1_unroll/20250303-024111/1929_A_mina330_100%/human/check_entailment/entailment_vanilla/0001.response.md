Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `ntest`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order using `a.sort()`.

3. **Calculating Maximum Beauty**:
   - The maximum beauty of the array is calculated as the difference between the last element (`a[len(a) - 1]`) and the first element (`a[0]`) of the sorted array.
   - This is because the beauty is defined as the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. Sorting ensures that the differences are maximized when the smallest value is subtracted from the largest value.

4. **Output**:
   - The result is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Check:

- **Test Case 1**: 
  - Input: `3`, `2 1 3`
  - After sorting: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Output: `3 - 1 = 2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: 
  - Input: `3`, `69 69 69`
  - After sorting: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Output: `69 - 69 = 0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: 
  - Input: `5`, `100 54 80 43 90`
  - After sorting: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - Output: `100 - 43 = 57` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: 
  - Input: `4`, `3 4 3 3`
  - After sorting: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
  - Output: `4 - 3 = 1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5**: 
  - Input: `2`, `2 1`
  - After sorting: `[1, 2]`
  - Output: `2 - 1 = 1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly sorts the array and calculates the maximum beauty by taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements. This approach ensures that the beauty is maximized.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **True**
