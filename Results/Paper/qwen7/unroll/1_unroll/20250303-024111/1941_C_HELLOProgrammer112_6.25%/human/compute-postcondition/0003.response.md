Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a total length of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) across all test cases not exceeding 10^6. For each test case, it returns information based on the value of `t` and the string `s`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t` and a string `s`. The function processes these inputs and returns specific information for each test case based on the value of `t` and the content of `s`.
