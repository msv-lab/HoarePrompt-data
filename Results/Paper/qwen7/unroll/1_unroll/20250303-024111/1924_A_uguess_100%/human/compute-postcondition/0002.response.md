Output State: t is the number of test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 26, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets. For each test case, if there are at least n substrings of s where each character appears exactly once among those substrings, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO' followed by a string ans constructed by finding the smallest character that does not appear in any substring of s with unique characters, appending it to the string of unique characters found, and filling the rest of the required length with 'a'.
