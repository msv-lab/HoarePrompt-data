#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each set of input data, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and the subsequent n - 1 lines describe the edges of the tree where each edge is represented by two integers v and u such that 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n.

    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each set of input data, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and the subsequent n - 1 lines describe the edges of the tree where each edge is represented by two integers v and u such that 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n. After executing the loop, the variable `solve()` has been called t times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of tree structures defined by user input. For each tree, it calls the `solve()` function `t` times (where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4). After processing all trees, it does not return any value but modifies internal states related to the trees. The primary action is to determine reachability within the trees based on the given constraints.
