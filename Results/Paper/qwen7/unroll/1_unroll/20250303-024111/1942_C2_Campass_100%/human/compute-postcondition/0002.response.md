Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `while t:` will execute as long as `t` is non-zero.

3. **Current state of `t`**: The state right before the loop is given as `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` is guaranteed to be a positive integer within the specified range.

4. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**: Since `t` is a positive integer (as per the given constraints), it is guaranteed to be non-zero. Therefore, the loop can execute the first time without any modification to the state of `t`.

Given this analysis, no adjustments are needed to the state of `t` for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
