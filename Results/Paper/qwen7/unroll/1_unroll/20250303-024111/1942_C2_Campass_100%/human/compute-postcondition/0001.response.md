Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `t` is the first element of the tuple returned by the lambda function `R()`.**

Explanation: The code `t, = R()` unpacks the tuple returned by the lambda function `R()` into the variable `t`. Since `R()` returns a tuple of integers and we only assign the first element to `t`, `t` now holds the first element of that tuple. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) remains valid, and it is now explicitly stated that `t` is the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`.
