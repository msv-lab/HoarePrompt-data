The function `func_1` accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is `False`, it reads an integer input from the user and returns it. If `isOne` is `True`, it disregards any input and always returns the integer `1`. In both cases, the final state of the program is that it has returned either the user's input or the integer `1`.
