Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the initial states step by step:

The `while` loop condition is `index != -1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `index` is not equal to `-1`.

The initial states are:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `a` is an integer in \(\{1, 2, 3\}\)
- `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\)
- `indices` is an empty list
- `index` is `None`

To make the loop execute at least once, `index` must not be equal to `-1`. Since `index` is initially `None`, we need to ensure that `index` is not `-1` when the loop starts.

Given that `index` is `None` initially, and `None` is not equal to `-1`, the loop will definitely execute at least once without any further adjustments to the states.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is an integer in \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\), `indices` is an empty list, `index` is `None`**
