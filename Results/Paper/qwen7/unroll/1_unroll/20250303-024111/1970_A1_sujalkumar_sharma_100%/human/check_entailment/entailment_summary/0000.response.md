Reasoning:
1. The program correctly calculates the balance of parentheses at each position in the input string.
2. It stores this information along with the index and character in a list of tuples.
3. The list is then sorted according to the specified criteria: first by the balance in ascending order, and then by the index in descending order within each balance group.
4. Finally, it constructs and returns a new string by concatenating the characters from the sorted list.

Given the provided execution summary and the steps outlined in the program, the implementation matches the requirements of the problem statement. The program performs all necessary steps to achieve the balanced shuffle operation as described.

Correctness: **True**
