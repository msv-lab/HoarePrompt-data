Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic for the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Prefix Balance Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the prefix balance for each character in the input string and stores it along with the position and character in a list `prefix_balance`.

2. **Sorting**: The list `prefix_balance` is sorted according to the rules specified: first by the prefix balance (in ascending order), and then by position (in descending order) in case of ties.

3. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the characters are extracted from the sorted list to form the final balanced shuffle sequence.

Given these points, the provided solution accurately performs the required operations and produces the correct output for the given input. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
