Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input string `s` and passes it to the function `func_1`.
2. The function `func_1` calculates the prefix balance for each character in the string `s` and stores this information along with the index and character in a list of tuples named `prefix_balance`.
3. The `prefix_balance` list is then sorted according to the problem's requirements: first by prefix balance in ascending order, and in case of a tie, by index in descending order.
4. Finally, the function constructs and returns the balanced shuffle by concatenating the characters from the sorted `prefix_balance` list.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the implementation appears to follow the steps outlined in the problem description accurately. There are no apparent logical errors or omissions in the code.

Correctness: **True**
