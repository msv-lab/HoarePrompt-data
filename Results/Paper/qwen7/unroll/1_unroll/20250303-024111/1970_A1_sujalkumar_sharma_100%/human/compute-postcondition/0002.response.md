Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `prefix_balance` is an empty list; `balance` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a variable `balance` to 0. This does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, or `prefix_balance`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `balance` is explicitly set to 0.
