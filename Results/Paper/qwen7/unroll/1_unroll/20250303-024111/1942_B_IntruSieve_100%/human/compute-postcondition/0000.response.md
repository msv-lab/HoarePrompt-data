Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5; a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. The list `a` is not modified by this code snippet, so its state remains as defined in the initial state.
