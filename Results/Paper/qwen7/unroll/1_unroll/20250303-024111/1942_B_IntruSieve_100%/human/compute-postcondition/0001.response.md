Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `a` is updated to `arr`, which is a list of integers obtained from the input.
