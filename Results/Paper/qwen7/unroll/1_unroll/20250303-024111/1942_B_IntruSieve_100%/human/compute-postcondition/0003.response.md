Output State: **`minn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers; `mex` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `minn = 0` initializes the variable `minn` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
