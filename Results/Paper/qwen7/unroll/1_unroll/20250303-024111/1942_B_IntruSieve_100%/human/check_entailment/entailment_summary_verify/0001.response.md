### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program step-by-step against the problem description and the provided function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Given an array \( a \) of length \( n \), we need to construct a permutation \( p \) such that \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
- The \(\texttt{MEX}\) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Program Code Recap:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes a list of integers `a` of length `n`.
- It calculates a modified MEX for each element in the list based on whether the element is positive or negative.
- If the element is positive, it appends the current minimum unused non-negative integer (`minn`) to the `mex` list and marks `minn` as used.
- If the element is negative, it appends the absolute difference between the element and the current minimum unused non-negative integer to the `mex` list and marks the calculated MEX value as used.
- After processing, the function sets `minn` to 10001 and ensures that all integers from 0 to `minn-1` are marked as used in a dictionary.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - Correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Initializes an empty list `mex` to store the MEX values.
   - Sets `minn` to 0, which is the candidate for MEX.
   - Uses a dictionary `used` to keep track of which numbers have been used.

3. **Processing Each Element of Array `a`:**
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array `a`:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, it appends `minn` to the `mex` list and marks `minn` as used.
     - If `minn` is already used, it increments `minn` until it finds a free slot.
     - If `arr[i]` is negative, it calculates the MEX value as `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and appends this value to the `mex` list, marking the calculated MEX value as used.

4. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - After processing all elements of `a`, the `mex` list contains the MEX values for each position.
   - Prints the `mex` list, which represents the permutation `p`.

#### Verification Against Examples:
1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input:
     ```
     3
     5
     1 1 -2 1 2
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     0 1 4 2 3
     ```
   - Explanation:
     - `a_1 = MEX([0]) - 0 = 1`
     - `a_2 = MEX([0, 1]) - 1 = 1`
     - `a_3 = MEX([0, 1, 4]) - 4 = -2`
     - `a_4 = MEX([0, 1, 4, 2]) - 2 = 1`
     - `a_5 = MEX([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) - 3 = 2`
   - The program constructs the permutation `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which matches the expected output.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input:
     ```
     5
     1 1 1 1 1
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     0 1 2 3 4
     ```
   - Explanation:
     - `a_1 = MEX([0]) - 0 = 1`
     - `a_2 = MEX([0, 1]) - 1 = 1`
     - `a_3 = MEX([0, 1, 2]) - 2 = 1`
     - `a_4 = MEX([0, 1, 2, 3]) - 3 = 1`
     - `a_5 = MEX([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) - 4 = 1`
   - The program constructs the permutation `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, which matches the expected output.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input:
     ```
     3
     -2 1 2
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     2 0 1
     ```
   - Explanation:
     - `a_1 = MEX([2]) - 2 = 0`
     - `a_2 = MEX([2, 0]) - 0 = 1`
     - `a_3 = MEX([2, 0, 1]) - 1 = 2`
   - The program constructs the permutation `[2, 0, 1]`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \) and matches the expected outputs for the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: True**
