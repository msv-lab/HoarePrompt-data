Output State: `minn` is 10001 (since `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `minn` is incremented until it is greater than `t`), `mex` is a list of integers where each element is either `minn` or `abs(arr[i] - minn)` depending on the value of `arr[i]`, and `used` is a dictionary with keys ranging from 0 to `minn-1` where each key is set to `True`.
