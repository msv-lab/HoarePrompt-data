Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `itm`, which iterates over the elements of the list `mex`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `itm`**: Since `itm` is an iterator over the list `mex`, the initial value of `itm` will be the first element of `mex`.

3. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `itm` can take on the values present in `mex`. Given that `itm` is iterating over `mex`, the state of `mex` must be such that it contains valid elements.

Based on the provided information:
- `minn` is 10001.
- `mex` is a list of integers where each element is either `minn` or `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
- `used` is a dictionary with keys ranging from 0 to `minn-1` where each key is set to `True`.

Since the loop is iterating over `mex`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `mex` itself. Specifically, `mex` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:
- `mex` must contain at least one element.

**Final State:**
State: **`minn` is 10001, `mex` must contain at least one element, `used` is a dictionary with keys ranging from 0 to `minn-1` where each key is set to `True`**
