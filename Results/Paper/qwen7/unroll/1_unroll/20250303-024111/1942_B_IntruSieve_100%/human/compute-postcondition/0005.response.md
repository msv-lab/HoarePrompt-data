Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will start with `i = 0`.
   - The condition `i < n` must be true for the loop to continue executing.
   - Therefore, `i` should start at 0 and `n` must be a positive integer.

3. **Check the Given States**:
   - `minn` is 0 (this does not affect the loop execution).
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) (this does not affect the loop execution).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\). For the loop to start, `n` must be at least 1.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(-n \leq a_i \leq n\) for all \(i\). This does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers (this does not affect the loop execution directly).
   - `mex` is an empty list (this does not affect the loop execution directly).
   - `used` is an empty dictionary (this does not affect the loop execution directly).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` should start at 0, we need to set `i` to 0.
   - `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to start.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 0 and `n` to be at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1**
