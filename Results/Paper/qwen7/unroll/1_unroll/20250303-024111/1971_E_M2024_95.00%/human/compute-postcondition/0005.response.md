Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), and \( q \), along with lists \( a \) and \( b \). For each test case, it handles \( q \) queries, calculating a value \( m \) based on the position of the query value \( ql \) within the list \( a \). If \( ql \) matches an element in \( a \), the output is the corresponding element in \( b \). Otherwise, it interpolates the value using the differences between consecutive elements in \( a \) and \( b \). The function outputs the results of these queries for each test case.**
