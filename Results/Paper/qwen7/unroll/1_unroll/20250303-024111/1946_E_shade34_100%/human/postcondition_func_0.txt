The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `a >= b` and gcd(`a`, `b`) = 1. It returns either 1 and 0, or d and c (where c and d are the results of calling `func_1(b, a)`), or 1 and -(a // b - 1), or d and c - a // b * d (where d and c are the results of the function call `func_1(b, a % b)`).
