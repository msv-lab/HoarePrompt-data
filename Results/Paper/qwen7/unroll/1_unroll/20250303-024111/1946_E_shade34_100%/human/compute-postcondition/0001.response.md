Output State: **The program returns the value of `c` multiplied by `a` modulo 1000000007.**

Explanation: The code snippet provided returns the value of `c` which is the result of calling `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, multiplied by `a` and then taking the result modulo 1000000007. Since `a` is an integer and `c` is the result of `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, the final output is the product of `a` and `c` modulo 1000000007.
