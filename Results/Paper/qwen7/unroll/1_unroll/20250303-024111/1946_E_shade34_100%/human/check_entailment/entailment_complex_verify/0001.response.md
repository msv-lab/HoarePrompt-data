### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the given program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the main problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. Let's break down the analysis further:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of permutations of length \( n \) that match the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The solution should output the count modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Key Functions**:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: Implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA) to find the multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo `b`.
   - `func_2(a, b)`: Computes \( a^{-1} \mod b \) using the result from `func_1`.

3. **Usage of Functions**:
   - The helper functions are correctly implemented for modular arithmetic, but they are not used in the context of solving the main problem. Specifically, there is no logic in the main part of the program that utilizes these functions to count permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program checks if the last prefix maximum is the same as the first suffix maximum and the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `n`. If these conditions are not met, it prints 0, indicating no valid permutations. Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate the number of valid permutations.
   - The calculation involves combinatorial operations (binomial coefficients) and uses the modular inverse function `func_2` to handle large numbers. However, the core logic to determine the number of valid permutations is missing.

5. **Combinatorial Operations**:
   - The program correctly handles the combinatorial calculations using binomial coefficients, but it does not incorporate the necessary constraints from the prefix and suffix maximums into these calculations.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The original assessment accurately identifies this issue.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it lacks the necessary logic to count permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums, despite having the correct modular arithmetic functions.
