Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `a >= b` and gcd(`a`, `b`) = 1. It returns either 1 and 0, or d and c (where c and d are the results of calling func_1(b, a)), or 1 and -(a // b - 1), or d and c - a // b * d (where d and c are the results of calling func_1(b, a % b)).**

This means the function `func_1` is designed to handle specific conditions involving two positive integers `a` and `b` with `a >= b` and their greatest common divisor being 1. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, the function may return different pairs of values following specific mathematical rules related to the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor.
