Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of permutations of length \( n \) that match the given prefix and suffix maximums. The solution uses combinatorial methods to calculate the number of possible permutations.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **Input Parsing**: The code correctly parses the input to get \( n \), \( m_1 \), \( m_2 \), the prefix maximums, and the suffix maximums.
   - **Edge Case Handling**: If the last prefix maximum is not equal to the first suffix maximum, or if the first prefix maximum is not 1, or if the last suffix maximum is not \( n \), the code correctly outputs 0 because no permutation can satisfy these conditions.
   - **Combinatorial Calculations**: The code uses the `func_2` function to perform modular multiplicative inverses and combinations, which are essential for calculating the number of valid permutations.
   - **Permutation Count Calculation**: The code calculates the number of ways to place elements between the prefix and suffix maximums using combinations and modular arithmetic.

3. **Execution Summary Analysis**:
   - **Function `facts`**: Precomputes factorials up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \) and stores them modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). This is used for efficient combination calculations.
   - **Main Loop**: Iterates over each test case, checks edge cases, and then calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial methods.
   - **Modular Arithmetic**: All operations are performed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers and ensure correctness.

Given the detailed execution summary and the logical flow of the code, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It handles all necessary cases and performs the required combinatorial calculations accurately.

Correctness: **True**
