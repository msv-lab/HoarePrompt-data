Precondition: **a is an integer, b is a list of integers where the length of b is either equal to the number of prefix maximums (m_1) or the number of suffix maximums (m_2), and 1000000007 is a constant integer representing \(10^9 + 7\).** 

Note: The function `func_1` is not provided, but based on the context, it likely returns a tuple where the first element is an integer and the second element is the constant integer \(10^9 + 7\). The function `func_2` uses the first element of the tuple returned by `func_1` and multiplies it by `a`, then takes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
