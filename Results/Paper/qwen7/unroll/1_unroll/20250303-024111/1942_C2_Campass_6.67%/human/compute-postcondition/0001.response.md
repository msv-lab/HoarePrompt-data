Output State: **`t` is the first integer returned by the lambda function `R()`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `t, = R()` calls the lambda function `R()` which returns a tuple containing one element (since the comma after `t` indicates a single-element tuple). This element is assigned to `t`. Since `R()` is a lambda function that takes input and splits it into integers, `t` will be the first integer from the input. The initial condition that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 remains valid and is updated with the actual value returned by `R()`.
