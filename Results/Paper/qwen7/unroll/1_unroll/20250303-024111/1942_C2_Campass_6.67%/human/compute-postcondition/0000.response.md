Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `R` is a lambda function that takes input and splits it into integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` which takes input from the user and splits it into a tuple of integers. This function does not assign any values to existing variables or change their states; instead, it provides a way to read input. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the lambda function `R`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer within the specified range.
