Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The input also includes a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Additionally, the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**
