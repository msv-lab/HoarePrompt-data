Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard. Specifically, the program uses a precomputed dynamic programming table (`dp`) to determine the number of configurations, but it does not account for the fact that the rooks placed by the player and the computer are mirrored, which affects the number of valid configurations.

The `dp` array is initialized and computed in a way that does not consider the constraints of the mirrored placement of rooks. For example, if the player places a rook at `(r, c)` and the computer mirrors it to `(c, r)`, this affects the number of available positions for future placements. The current implementation does not handle this mirroring logic correctly.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 1
  1 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

- Actual Output (using the provided program):
  ```
  1
  ```

The program incorrectly calculates the number of configurations because it does not properly account for the mirrored placements and the reduction in available positions due to the rooks already placed. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
