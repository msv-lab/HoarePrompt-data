Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to calculate the number of possible final configurations of an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves.
   - Each move involves placing a rook in a valid position such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The computer mirrors the player's move by placing a rook in the mirrored position.
   - The final configurations should consider the positions of the rooks and their colors.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations.
   - `dp` array is used to store intermediate results.
   - `func_1` initializes the `dp` array using a specific recurrence relation.
   - The main loop processes each test case by determining the number of invalid positions and using the `dp` array to find the number of valid configurations.

3. **Dynamic Programming Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes the `dp` array with base cases:
     - \( dp[1] = 1 \)
     - \( dp[2] = 3 \)
   - For \( i \geq 3 \), the recurrence relation is:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]) \mod 1000000007
     \]
   - This recurrence relation seems to correctly model the number of ways to place rooks in a row without them attacking each other.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It then reads \( k \) moves and adds the row and column indices to a set `invalid`.
   - The number of valid positions left is \( n - |invalid| \).
   - The result is calculated using the `dp` array: `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The dynamic programming approach correctly models the number of ways to place rooks without them attacking each other.
   - The use of modulo \( 1000000007 \) ensures the result fits within standard integer limits.
   - The logic to handle the invalid positions and use the `dp` array is sound.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It uses dynamic programming to precompute the number of valid configurations and then uses this information to determine the number of possible final configurations for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
