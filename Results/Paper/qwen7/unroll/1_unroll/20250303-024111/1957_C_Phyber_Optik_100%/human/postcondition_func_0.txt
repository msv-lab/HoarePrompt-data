The function accepts an integer `n` and computes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach the `i-th` position under certain constraints. Specifically, for each `i` from 3 to `n`, `dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. After executing the function, the array `dp` contains precomputed values up to `n`, with `dp[1]` set to 1 and `dp[2]` set to 3.
