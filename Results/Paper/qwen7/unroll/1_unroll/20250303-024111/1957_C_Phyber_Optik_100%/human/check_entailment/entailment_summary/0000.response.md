Reasoning:

1. The provided program uses dynamic programming to compute the number of valid configurations for an \( n \times n \) chessboard where rooks cannot attack each other. The dynamic programming array `dp` is used to store the number of ways to place rooks up to a certain number of non-attacking rooks.

2. The `func_1` function initializes the base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, and then iterates from 3 to `n` to fill the `dp` array using the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.

3. In the main part of the program, it reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played. It then calculates the number of invalid positions (positions where rooks are already placed) and uses this to find the number of valid configurations by looking up the precomputed value in the `dp` array.

4. The formula used in the `dp` array calculation correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks without them attacking each other, considering the constraints of the problem.

5. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid final configurations after the initial `k` moves.

Based on the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
