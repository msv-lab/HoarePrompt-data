Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Additionally, a list a of n integers is given such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i's are pairwise different. After executing the loop, the value of `ans` is determined by comparing the first element of the list `s` with the elements following it up to index `k-1`, and counting how many elements are greater than or equal to the first element. The value of `ans1` is determined by finding the first occurrence of the maximum element (initially stored in `h`) in the list starting from index `p+1` to `k-1`, and counting how many elements are greater than or equal to this maximum element. The final output is the maximum of `ans` and `ans1`.
