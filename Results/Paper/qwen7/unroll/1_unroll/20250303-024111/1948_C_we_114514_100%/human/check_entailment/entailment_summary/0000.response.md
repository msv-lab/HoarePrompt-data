Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if a robot starting at (1,1) can reach (2,n) by moving according to the arrows in a 2xN grid.
2. The solution is divided into two functions:
   - `func_1`: This function checks if the robot can reach (2,n) for a single test case. It does this by examining the arrows in the grid and returning 'No' if certain invalid configurations are found, otherwise it returns 'Yes'.
   - `func_2`: This function processes multiple test cases. It reads the necessary inputs for each test case, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

3. Let's analyze `func_1`:
   - It correctly checks if the robot can reach (2,n) by ensuring that the arrows allow movement from (1,1) to (2,n).
   - Specifically, it checks if the arrows in the middle of the grid (i.e., between pairs of cells) allow the robot to move towards the target column (n).

4. Let's analyze `func_2`:
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results.

Given the problem constraints and the execution summaries, both functions seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The first function `func_1` correctly identifies invalid configurations that prevent the robot from reaching (2,n), and the second function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases.

Therefore, the program as a whole meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
