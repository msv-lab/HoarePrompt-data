Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even, row1 and row2 are strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', the code reads input and processes each test case.**

The code provided is a comment block that describes the process of reading input and processing each test case. However, it does not alter the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial conditions remain unchanged.
