To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `results` is a list where each element is the result of calling `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each iteration of the loop.
   - `n`, `row1`, and `row2` are inputs to the function `func_1` during each iteration of the loop.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('\n'.join(results))
   ```

This line of code joins all the elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). Therefore, it will print each element of the `results` list on a new line.

Since the exact values of `results` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of the `results` list.

**Output**: **each element of the `results` list, each on a new line**
