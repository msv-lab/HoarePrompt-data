Output State: **`The program returns a list of results where each element is the number of draws for each valid test case, and -1 for invalid cases`.**

Explanation: The given code snippet simply returns the `resultats` list, which contains the number of draws for each valid test case (where the scores of the three players are the same) and -1 for invalid cases (where the scores are not sorted non-decreasingly or do not fall within the range 0 to 30). Since no further operations are performed on the `resultats` list, the program directly returns it as is.
