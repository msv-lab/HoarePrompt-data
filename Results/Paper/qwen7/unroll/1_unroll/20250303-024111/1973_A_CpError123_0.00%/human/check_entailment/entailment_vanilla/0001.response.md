### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**: 
   - The program uses a list `cas_de_test` to store the test cases, which is hardcoded. This approach is fine if the number of test cases is fixed and small (as in this case, where `t = 7`). However, if the number of test cases can vary, this method would need to be adjusted to read from standard input or another source.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case and calculates the maximum number of draws.
   - It first checks if the total points (`total_points`) are even. If not, it immediately returns `-1` because an odd total points cannot be achieved through the given scoring rules.
   - It then calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs`) by dividing the total points by 2.
   - Next, it checks if the total number of matches is more than 3 or if the highest score (`p3`) is greater than the total number of matches. If either condition is true, it returns `-1` because these conditions violate the constraints of the problem.
   - Finally, it calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites // 2`, where `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula accounts for the points distribution among the players considering the possibility of draws.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results of each test case using `'\n'.join(map(str, resultats))`.

### Analysis of Provided Test Cases:
- **Case (0, 0, 0)**: No games, so no draws. Correct output: `0`.
- **Case (0, 1, 1)**: One draw between the second and third player. Correct output: `1`.
- **Case (0, 2, 3)**: Invalid case because the scores do not match any valid combination of games. Correct output: `-1`.
- **Case (3, 3, 3)**: Invalid case because the scores do not match any valid combination of games. Correct output: `-1`.
- **Case (3, 4, 5)**: Six draws. Correct output: `6`.
- **Case (1, 1, 10)**: Two draws between the first and second player, and four draws between the first and third player. Correct output: `2`.
- **Case (0, 0, 6)**: Invalid case because the scores do not match any valid combination of games. Correct output: `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct based on the given problem description and test cases.

### Correctness:
