Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `k` is greater than `4n - 2`, which is the maximum number of diagonals in an `n x n` grid. According to the problem description, the value of `k` should not exceed `4n - 2`. However, the program does not check this condition and proceeds to calculate the number of cells to color based on an invalid value of `k`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 20
```
Here, `n = 5` and `k = 20`. Since `4n - 2 = 18`, `k` should not exceed 18. However, the program will still attempt to compute the result, leading to an incorrect output. The correct output should be 5, but the program will incorrectly compute a value based on `k // 2 + 1`, which is not valid in this context.

To fix this, the program should include a check to ensure that `k` does not exceed `4n - 2`.
