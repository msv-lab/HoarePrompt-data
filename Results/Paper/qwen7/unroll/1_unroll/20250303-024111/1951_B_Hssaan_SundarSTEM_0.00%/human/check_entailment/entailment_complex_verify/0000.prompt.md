You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it swaps the first element of the list with the element at index `k-1`. It then calculates two values, `ans` and `ans1`, based on the list elements and compares them to determine the maximum value. Finally, it prints the maximum value obtained from `ans` and `ans1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not account for the scenario where swapping the cow's position could potentially allow the cow to win more matches.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

### Example Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  5 3
  5 1 3 2 4
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  2
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  The program outputs `1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - There are 5 cows with ratings `[5, 1, 3, 2, 4]`.
   - Cow `k` is cow `3`, which has a rating of `3`.

2. **First Match:**
   - Cow `1` (rating `5`) vs Cow `2` (rating `1`): Cow `1` wins.
   - Remaining cows: `[5, 3, 2, 4]`.

3. **Second Match:**
   - Cow `2` (rating `3`) vs Cow `1` (rating `5`): Cow `1` wins.
   - Remaining cows: `[5, 2, 4]`.

4. **Third Match:**
   - Cow `3` (rating `2`) vs Cow `1` (rating `5`): Cow `1` wins.
   - Remaining cows: `[5, 4]`.

5. **Fourth Match:**
   - Cow `4` (rating `4`) vs Cow `1` (rating `5`): Cow `1` wins.
   - Remaining cow: `[5]`.

- **Cow `3`'s Wins:**
  - Cow `3` wins in the second match (vs Cow `1`).
  - Cow `3` does not win in the third or fourth matches.

By swapping Cow `3` with Cow `2` (rating `2`), we can change the sequence of matches as follows:

1. **Swapping Positions:**
   - Cow `3` moves to position `2` with rating `2`.
   - New order: `[5, 2, 3, 4]`.

2. **First Match:**
   - Cow `1` (rating `5`) vs Cow `2` (rating `2`): Cow `1` wins.
   - Remaining cows: `[5, 3, 4]`.

3. **Second Match:**
   - Cow `3` (rating `3`) vs Cow `1` (rating `5`): Cow `1` wins.
   - Remaining cows: `[5, 4]`.

4. **Third Match:**
   - Cow `4` (rating `4`) vs Cow `1` (rating `5`): Cow `1` wins.
   - Remaining cow: `[5]`.

- **Cow `3`'s Wins:**
  - Cow `3` wins in the second match (vs Cow `1`).
  - Cow `3` wins in the third match (vs Cow `4`).

Thus, by swapping, Cow `3` can win 2 matches instead of 1.

The provided program does not consider this optimal strategy, hence it is incorrect.
