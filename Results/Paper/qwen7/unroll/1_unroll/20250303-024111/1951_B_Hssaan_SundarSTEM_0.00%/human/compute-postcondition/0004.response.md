Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it swaps the first element of the list with the element at index `k-1`. It then calculates two values, `ans` and `ans1`, based on the list elements and compares them to determine the maximum value. Finally, it prints the maximum value obtained from `ans` and `ans1`.**
