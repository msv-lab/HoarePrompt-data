The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes integers n, m, and k, along with two arrays a and b as inputs. It counts the occurrences of integers up to k in both arrays, ensuring that the counts do not exceed k//2. If the counts of integers in both arrays up to k//2 are equal, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.
