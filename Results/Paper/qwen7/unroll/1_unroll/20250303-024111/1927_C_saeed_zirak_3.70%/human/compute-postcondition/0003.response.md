Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes integers n, m, k, arrays a and b as inputs. It returns a result based on the conditions specified.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (where `k` is an even integer), and two arrays `a` and `b` consisting of integers. The function then processes these inputs according to the given constraints and returns a result based on the specified conditions.
