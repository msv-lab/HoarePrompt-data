Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `i` will take each character from the string `s` one by one during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `s` is non-empty.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `s` is a string of length `m`, and `m` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 1000\), we need to ensure that `s` is non-empty.
   - The variable `i` will be set to the first character of the string `s` at the start of the loop.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `s` must be a non-empty string (since the loop will not execute if `s` is empty).
- `i` must be set to the first character of the string `s`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the string `s`**.
