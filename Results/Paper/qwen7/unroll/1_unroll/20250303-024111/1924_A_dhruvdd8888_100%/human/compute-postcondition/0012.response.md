Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000.
- `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `win` is a list containing the last `k` unique characters from `s` that are also in `us`.
- `ans` is a list of characters added to `win` when its size reaches `k`.
- `ps` is an integer representing the number of times `win` reached size `k`, and `ps` is less than `n`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'` without any variables or expressions evaluated within it.

Output: **NO**
