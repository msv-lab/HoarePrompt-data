Reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1()` is designed to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string `s`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function correctly initializes the sets `us` and `win` to store the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and the last `k` unique characters from `s` that are also in `us`, respectively.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and updates `win` whenever it encounters a character that is in `us`. When `win` has `k` elements, it means we have found a valid subsequence of length `k` and adds the character to `ans` and clears `win` to start a new potential subsequence.
   - After processing the entire string `s`, it checks if the count of complete subsequences (`ps`) is at least `n`. If so, it prints 'YES', indicating that all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences of `s`.
   - If `ps` is less than `n`, it prints 'NO' and tries to construct a counterexample by checking if any character from `us` is missing in `win`. If a missing character is found, it constructs a string of length `n` using the characters in `ans` and the missing character, followed by enough 'a' characters to make the total length `n`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `ps < n` by constructing a counterexample string, ensuring that the output is valid according to the problem statement.
   - The logic for checking and constructing the counterexample is correct and covers all possible scenarios.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' correctly based on the condition `ps >= n`.
   - If 'NO' is printed, the constructed string is valid and meets the requirements of the problem.

Given the analysis, the function correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
