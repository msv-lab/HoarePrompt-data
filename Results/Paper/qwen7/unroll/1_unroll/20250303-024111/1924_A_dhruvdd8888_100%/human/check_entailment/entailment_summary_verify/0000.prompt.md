You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()

        return print('YES')
    print('NO')
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \), and a string \( s \) of length \( m \) consisting of the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets. It checks if it's possible to form a sequence of length \( n \) using only the characters in \( s \). If such a sequence can be formed for all test cases, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If 'NO' is printed, it further checks which characters from the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets are missing in the sequence and appends them to the result along with the required number of 'a' characters to reach the length \( n \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Specifically, the program only checks if a subset of these strings can be found as subsequences in the input string `s`. It does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences.

For example, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 3 10
  aabbccabab
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  bcc
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

In this case, the program incorrectly returns "YES" because it only checks for the presence of a subset of possible strings (like "ccc") but does not verify all possible strings of length 3 (which include combinations like "abc", "acb", etc.). The program fails to account for all permutations of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, leading to incorrect results.
