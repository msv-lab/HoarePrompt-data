You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    #State: Output State: The output state consists of "YES" or "NO" printed for each query within the range specified by `m` queries. For each query `(a, b)`, it checks if the number of `1`s in the subarray `l[a-1:b+1]` is at least half the length of the subarray plus one. If true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it handles a list of positive integers `c` and a series of queries. Each query specifies a range within the list, and the function determines whether the number of occurrences of the integer `1` in that range is at least half the length of the range plus one. If true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each query.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good according to the given problem description. Specifically, the program checks if the sum of the subarray minus the count of 1s in the subarray is greater than or equal to the length of the subarray minus one. However, this approach does not fully capture the requirement that there must exist an array `b` where `b_i > 0` and `a_i != b_i` for all indices.

A counterexample to demonstrate the issue:
Consider the subarray `[1, 1, 1]`. According to the program's logic, since the sum of the subarray is 3 and the count of 1s is 3, the condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` would be satisfied (3 - 3 >= 3), leading the program to print 'YES'. However, this subarray cannot be considered good because there is no way to construct an array `b` where all elements are positive and different from the corresponding elements in the subarray `[1, 1, 1]`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to ensure that the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` where all elements are distinct and positive. This involves checking if the subarray can be partitioned in such a way that each element can be replaced with a different positive value while maintaining the sum constraint.
