Output State: The output state consists of "YES" or "NO" printed for each query within the range specified by `m` queries. For each query `(a, b)`, it checks if the number of `1`s in the subarray `l[a-1:b+1]` is at least half the length of the subarray plus one. If true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
