Output State: The output state consists of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each query within the range specified by `m` queries. For each query defined by `a` and `b`, 'YES' is printed if the number of 1s in the subarray from index `a` to index `b` (inclusive) is at least half the length of the subarray, otherwise 'NO' is printed.
