Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) and another integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). For each test case, it also processes 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). The function returns different outputs based on the conditions given for the integers involved in each test case.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing specific integers and a list of numbers, and returns results based on these inputs without accepting any parameters directly in its definition.
