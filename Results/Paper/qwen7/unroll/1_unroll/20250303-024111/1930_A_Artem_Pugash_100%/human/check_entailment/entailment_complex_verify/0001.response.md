### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of pairs of integers).
   - It then reads `2n` integers and stores them in a list `l`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `l` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Scoring Calculation**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, starting from index 0.
   - For each pair `(l[i], l[i+1])`, it adds the smaller value (`l[i]`) to the score.
   - This is done using the expression `score += l[i]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The final score is printed for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Optimal Strategy
The optimal strategy for maximizing the score is to always choose the smallest available values in each move. Sorting the list ensures that the smallest values are paired together, and the smaller value of each pair is added to the score. This approach is indeed optimal because it ensures that the smallest values are used first, which maximizes the cumulative score.

#### Correctness of the Implementation
- **Sorting**: Sorting the list is correct because it arranges the numbers in non-decreasing order, ensuring that the smallest values are paired together.
- **Scoring Calculation**: The loop `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2)` correctly iterates over the sorted list in pairs, and `score += l[i]` adds the smaller value of each pair to the score. This is the correct way to implement the optimal strategy.
- **Output**: The final score is correctly printed for each test case.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the optimal strategy for maximizing the score by always choosing the smallest available values in each move. The sorting and scoring logic are correct and align with the problem requirements.

**Original Assessment:**
The original assessment concluded that the program correctly implements the optimal strategy, which is accurate.
