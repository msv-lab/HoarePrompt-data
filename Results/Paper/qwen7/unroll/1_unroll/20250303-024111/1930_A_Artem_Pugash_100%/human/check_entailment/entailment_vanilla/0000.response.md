### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score.
2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - The list is then sorted in ascending order.
   - The score is calculated by summing up every other element starting from the first element in the sorted list.
   - This means the score is the sum of the smallest elements in each pair.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To maximize the score, we should always choose the smallest available integers to pair together because the score is determined by the minimum of each pair.
   - Sorting the list ensures that the smallest integers are paired first, which aligns with the optimal strategy.

4. **Verification**:
   - For the example test cases:
     - Test Case 1: `2 3` -> Sorted: `[2, 3]` -> Score: `2`
     - Test Case 2: `1 1 2 1` -> Sorted: `[1, 1, 1, 2]` -> Score: `1 + 1 = 2`
     - Test Case 3: `1 1 1 1 1 1` -> Sorted: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` -> Score: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`

   - The solution correctly implements the optimal strategy and produces the expected results.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum score by always pairing the smallest available integers.

**Correctness: True**
