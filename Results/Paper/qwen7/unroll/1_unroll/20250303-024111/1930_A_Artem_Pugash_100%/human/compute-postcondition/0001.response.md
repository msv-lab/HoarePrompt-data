Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers on the whiteboard are 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. After executing the loop, the score for each test case is the sum of the smallest element and the third smallest element, the fifth smallest element and so on, up to the (2n-1)th smallest element, from the sorted list of the 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}.
