Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers. It then sorts this list in ascending order.
3. **Scoring Logic**: By iterating over the sorted list in steps of 2 (i.e., `l[0]`, `l[2]`, `l[4]`, ...), it adds the elements at even indices to the score. This ensures that in each pair `(x, y)`, the smaller element (`\min(x, y)`) is always added to the score.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the accumulated score for each test case.

This approach guarantees that the score is maximized because the smallest available numbers are paired together, ensuring that the minimum of each pair is always used, which is optimal for maximizing the sum of these minimums.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly computes the maximum final score for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
