Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the input value obtained from `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Range of the Input:**
   - The problem states that `t` (the input value) is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`.
   - This means the loop will run `t` times, where `t` is within this range.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop will run based on the input value `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range.
   - The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is within the valid range for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000**
