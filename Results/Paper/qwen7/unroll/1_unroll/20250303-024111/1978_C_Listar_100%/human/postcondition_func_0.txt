The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5) and `k` (an integer between 0 and 10^12). It reduces `k` by half, initializes a list `l` with integers from 1 to `n`, and iterates over `l` in reverse order. If `k` becomes zero, it returns the list `l`. If `k` is less than the current index minus one, it calls another function `func_2` with parameters `c`, `k`, and `l`. Otherwise, it decrements `k` and calls another function `func_3` with parameters `c` and `l`. Finally, it returns the modified list `l` where `c` is 1, `k` is 0, and `l` contains integers from 1 to `n`.
