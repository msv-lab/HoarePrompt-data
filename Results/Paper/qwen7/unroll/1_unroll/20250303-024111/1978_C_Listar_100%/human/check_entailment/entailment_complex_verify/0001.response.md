### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation of length `n` such that its Manhattan value equals `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is calculated as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).
   - If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code is divided into several functions.
   - `func_4()` checks if `k` is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a given `n`.
   - `func_1()` is the main function that tries to construct the permutation.
   - `func_2()` and `func_3()` are helper functions that swap elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - `func_5()` prints the permutation if found.
   - `func_6()` orchestrates the process by calling the necessary functions.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The code attempts to build a permutation by swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - The logic seems to handle the construction of permutations for even and odd `n` differently.
   - The code uses a recursive approach to adjust the Manhattan value by swapping elements.

4. **Testing Specific Cases:**
   - **Case 1:** `n = 3`, `k = 4`
     - The permutation `[3, 1, 2]` has a Manhattan value of 4.
   - **Case 2:** `n = 4`, `k = 5`
     - The code should return "No" because no permutation of length 4 can have a Manhattan value of 5.
   - **Case 3:** `n = 7`, `k = 0`
     - The permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` has a Manhattan value of 0.
   - **Case 4:** `n = 1`, `k = 1000000000000`
     - The code should return "No" because no permutation of length 1 can have a Manhattan value greater than 0.
   - **Case 5:** `n = 8`, `k = 14`
     - The permutation `[8, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7]` has a Manhattan value of 14.
   - **Case 6:** `n = 112`, `k = 777`
     - The code should return "No" because no permutation of length 112 can have a Manhattan value of 777.
   - **Case 7:** `n = 5`, `k = 12`
     - The code should return "No" because no permutation of length 5 can have a Manhattan value of 12.
   - **Case 8:** `n = 5`, `k = 2`
     - The permutation `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]` has a Manhattan value of 2.

5. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - **Function `func_4()`**: This function correctly checks if `k` is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a given `n`. However, it does not handle the case when `k` is odd and `n` is even, which can lead to incorrect results.
   - **Function `func_1()`**: This function attempts to construct the permutation by adjusting the Manhattan value using swaps. However, the logic in `func_1()` is flawed. Specifically, the loop condition `for i in range(n, -1, -2)` is incorrect because it should iterate over the range from `n-1` to `0` in steps of 2. Additionally, the logic inside the loop does not correctly handle the adjustment of the Manhattan value.
   - **Functions `func_2()` and `func_3()`**: These functions correctly swap elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value, but they are called incorrectly in `func_1()`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The code does not correctly handle the construction of permutations and the calculation of the Manhattan value. The logic in `func_1()` is flawed, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.
