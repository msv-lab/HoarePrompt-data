Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of cells.
   - It then reads a string `arr` which is supposed to represent the state of the cells (where '1' indicates a chip and '0' indicates a free cell).

2. **Finding Chip Positions:**
   - The program uses `arr.find('1')` to find the index of the first chip from the left.
   - It uses `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the index of the last chip from the right. This is done by reversing the string and finding the first occurrence of '1'.

3. **Extracting Relevant Part of the String:**
   - The program extracts a substring `z` from the original string `arr` using the indices found in steps 2a and 2b.

4. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - The program counts the number of '0's (free cells) in the extracted substring `z`.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Extraction of Substring:**
   - The program attempts to extract a substring `z` from `arr` using the indices found. However, this approach does not correctly handle the positions of the chips relative to the entire array.
   - Specifically, `x` and `y` are the positions of the first and last chips, but the substring `z` is not correctly defined to include all chips and exclude all free cells between them.

2. **Logic Error:**
   - The logic for counting the minimum number of operations to move all chips into a single block is flawed. The program simply counts the number of free cells between the first and last chips, which is not the correct approach.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to count the number of free cells between the first and last chip. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        # Find the positions of the first and last chip
        first_chip = arr.find('1')
        last_chip = arr.rfind('1')
        # Count the number of free cells between the first and last chip
        free_cells_between = arr[first_chip:last_chip+1].count('0')
        print(free_cells_between)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
