Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating a permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. However, the logic used to calculate `res[i]` is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates `mex` and does not correctly reflect the definition of MEX.

Here's the breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `mex`**: The program decrements `mex` incorrectly. The variable `mex` should represent the smallest non-negative integer not present in the prefix of `p` up to index `i`. The current implementation does not correctly track this value.

2. **Incorrect Assignment of `res[i]`**: The formula `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` does not align with the definition of MEX. The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set, but the program does not properly compute this.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that `mex` is updated correctly as we process each element of `p`. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        mex = 0
        
        # Initialize the result array with the smallest possible values
        for i in range(n):
            while mex in res:
                mex += 1
            res[i] = mex
            mex += 1
        
        # Adjust the result array based on the given array 'a'
        for i in range(n):
            res[i] -= ar[i]
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))

```

With this corrected approach:
- We initialize the `res` array to contain the smallest possible values.
- We then adjust each element of `res` based on the corresponding value in `a`.
- This ensures that the MEX condition is satisfied for each position in the permutation.

Given the above reasoning, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
