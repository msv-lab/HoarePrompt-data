The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `ar` of `n` integers. It then calculates a new list `res` where each element `res[i]` is determined as `mex - ar[i]`, with `mex` being decremented based on the values in `ar`. Finally, it prints the elements of `res` for each test case.
