You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `ar` of size `n`.

2. **Result Array Initialization:**
   - It initializes a result array `res` of size `n` with `None` values.
   - It also initializes `mex` (minimum excluded value) to `n`.

3. **Backward Iteration and Calculation:**
   - The program iterates backward through the array `ar` using a `for` loop.
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result array `res` as a space-separated string.

### Reasoning:

1. **Backward Iteration Logic:**
   - The logic in the loop seems to be trying to calculate the permutation `p` based on the given array `ar`.
   - However, the calculation `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` and updating `mex` might not correctly reflect the MEX operation as defined in the problem statement.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The MEX of an array should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - The current logic does not correctly handle the MEX calculation for the permutation construction.

3. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The problem requires constructing a permutation `p` such that `a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i`.
   - The current approach does not ensure that the resulting `p` satisfies this condition for all `i`.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the given example with the provided solution:

#### Input:
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
5
1 1 1 1 1
3
-2 1 2
```

#### Expected Output:
```
0 1 4 2 3
0 1 2 3 4
2 0 1
```

#### Actual Output:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))
```

Running the above code with the given input does not produce the expected output. Let's manually check the logic:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `ar = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
   - `mex = 5`
   - Iterations:
     - `i = 4`: `res[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = 3`
     - `i = 3`: `res[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
     - `i = 2`: `res[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = 4`
     - `i = 1`: `res[1] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = 3`
     - `i = 0`: `res[0] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
   - Result: `[2, 3, 4, 3, 2]` (which is incorrect)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `ar = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - `mex = 5`
   - Iterations:
     - `i = 4`: `res[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = 4`
     - `i = 3`: `res[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = 3`
     - `i = 2`: `res[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
     - `i = 1`: `res[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = 1`
     - `i = 0`: `res[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
   - Result: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` (which is correct but not the only valid solution)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `ar = [-2, 1, 2]`
   - `mex = 3`
   - Iterations:
     - `i = 2`: `res[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = 1`
     - `i = 1`: `res[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
     - `i = 0`: `res[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = 2`
   - Result: `[2, 0, 1]` (which is correct)

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the MEX calculation and permutation construction logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
