Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality. The functions defined in the program do not relate to solving the problem described. Specifically, the problem requires finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array after adding a permutation. However, none of the functions provided are relevant to this task. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
2
1 2
4
7 1 4 1
3
103 102 104
```

The expected output would be:
```
2
2
3
```

However, since the provided functions do not perform any operations related to the problem, they will not produce the correct results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
