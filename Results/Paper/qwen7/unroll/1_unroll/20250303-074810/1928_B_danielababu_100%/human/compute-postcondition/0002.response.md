Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i`, `len(arr) - 1`, `-1`, and `-1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(arr) - 1` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by `1` each time.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts at `len(arr) - 1` and decrements until `0`, the initial value of `i` should be `len(arr) - 1`.

4. **Adjust other relevant states**:
   - `arr` is a list of positive integers.
   - `ans` is an empty list, and this variable is not directly involved in the loop head, so no adjustment is needed for `ans`.
   - `tem` is 1, and this variable is not directly involved in the loop head, so no adjustment is needed for `tem`.

5. **Finalize the state**: Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be equal to `len(arr) - 1`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**.
