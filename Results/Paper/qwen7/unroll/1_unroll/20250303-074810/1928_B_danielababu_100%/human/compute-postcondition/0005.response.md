Output State: **`ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of the elements in `arr` from the last element to the first, starting with `tem` initialized to 1.**

This means that after the loop, the `ans` list will contain the cumulative product of the elements in `arr`, calculated from the end to the start. For example, if `arr = [2, 3, 4]`, then `ans` would be `[24, 8, 4]` because:

- Starting from the end, the first element (4) is added to `ans` as is.
- Moving to the next element (3), the cumulative product so far is `4 * 3 = 12`, but since `ans` already has 4, we update it to `4 * 3 = 12`.
- Finally, for the first element (2), the cumulative product so far is `12 * 2 = 24`, so `ans` becomes `[24, 12, 4]`.

However, the exact content of `ans` depends on the actual values in `arr`. The program returns the `ans` list as described.
