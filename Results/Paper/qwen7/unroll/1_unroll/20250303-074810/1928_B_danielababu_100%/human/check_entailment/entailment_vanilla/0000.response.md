### Reasoning:

The given program does not actually solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal in an array `a` by adding a permutation `p` to each element of `a`. This means we need to find a permutation such that the resulting array has the maximum frequency of any single number.

2. **Given Functions**: The functions defined in the program (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, etc.) are utility functions for reading input data. They do not perform any operations related to solving the problem.

3. **Solution Approach**: To solve this problem, we need to:
   - Read the array `a`.
   - Find a permutation `p` that maximizes the frequency of a single number in the modified array `a + p`.

4. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the sum of the elements in `a` and the sum of the elements in `p` should remain the same for the total sum to stay constant. Therefore, the best strategy is to try to make all elements of the array equal to the mode (most frequent element) of the array. If there are multiple modes, we can choose any one of them.

5. **Implementation**:
   - Calculate the frequency of each element in the array.
   - Identify the mode(s) of the array.
   - Check if making all elements equal to the mode is possible by ensuring the sum of the differences between the elements and the mode is zero (i.e., the sum of the array minus the mode times the length of the array should be divisible by the length of the array).
   - If possible, the result is the length of the array; otherwise, it is the highest frequency found.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not contain any function that solves the problem. It only defines utility functions for reading input. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:

**False**
