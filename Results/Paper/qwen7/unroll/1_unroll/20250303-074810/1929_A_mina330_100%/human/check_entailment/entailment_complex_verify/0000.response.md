### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the maximum beauty of an array \( a \) defined as the sum of the values \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all integers \( i \) from 2 to \( n \). To achieve the maximum beauty, we need to rearrange the elements of the array optimally.

#### Program Analysis:
The given program reads multiple test cases and for each test case:
1. Reads the length \( n \) of the array.
2. Reads the array elements.
3. Sorts the array.
4. Prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Sorting Approach**: The program sorts the array and prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements. This approach does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty because it does not consider the optimal pairing of elements to maximize the sum of differences.
2. **Optimal Pairing**: To maximize the beauty, we need to pair the largest element with the smallest element, the second largest with the second smallest, and so on. This ensures that the differences are maximized.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
3
4
3 4 3 3
```
- If we sort the array, we get `[3, 3, 3, 4]`.
- The difference between the largest and smallest elements is `4 - 3 = 1`.

However, the optimal arrangement to maximize the beauty is `[3, 4, 3, 3]` or `[4, 3, 3, 3]`, which gives a beauty of `1` (since the differences are `4-3=1`, `3-3=0`, `3-3=0`, and `3-4=-1`).

The program's current approach does not account for this optimal pairing, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array because it only considers the difference between the largest and smallest elements after sorting, rather than the optimal pairing of elements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
