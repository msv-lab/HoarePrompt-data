Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array for each test case. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `ntest` and iterates over each test case using a loop. It then reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.

2. **Sorting**: For each test case, the array `a` is sorted in ascending order. Sorting ensures that the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the array is maximized when considering the expression `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

3. **Calculating Maximum Beauty**: After sorting, the maximum beauty is calculated as the difference between the last (largest) and first (smallest) elements of the sorted array. This is because the expression `(a_i - a_{i-1})` will always yield the maximum possible value when `a_i` is the largest element and `a_{i-1}` is the smallest element.

4. **Output**: The result is printed for each test case, which is the correct maximum beauty for that test case.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the program correctly computes the maximum beauty for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
