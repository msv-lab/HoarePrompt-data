Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function returns a value based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function does not take any direct parameters but processes the data provided through these test cases and returns a result for each one.
