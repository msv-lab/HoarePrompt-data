### Your Response:

Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to find the minimum cost to travel between two cities, where the cost of traveling to the closest city is 1 coin and the cost of traveling directly to another city is the absolute difference in their coordinates.
   - Each city has a unique closest city, meaning there is no ambiguity in determining the closest city for any given city.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code uses `defaultdict` to store distances.
   - It calculates distances in two passes: one from left to right (`d1`) and one from right to left (`d2`).
   - For each pass, it updates the distance to the next city based on whether the current city is closer to its next city or the previous city.
   - After calculating these distances, it processes the queries by subtracting the stored values to find the minimum cost.

3. **Correctness of the Provided Code**:
   - The logic for calculating the distances in the forward and backward passes is correct. The code correctly identifies the closest city for each city and calculates the minimum cost to travel to that city.
   - The distances stored in `d1` and `d2` are used to determine the minimum cost for each query by subtracting the appropriate values.
   - The code handles the unique closest city constraint correctly, ensuring that the closest city is always chosen.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function processes a list `a` of `n` integers in strictly increasing order and handles `m` queries. For each query consisting of two distinct integers `x` and `y`, it computes and prints the difference between the values stored in dictionaries `d1` and `d2`.
   - The function correctly uses the precomputed distances to determine the minimum cost for each query.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. The original assessment identified some issues but did not fully capture the correctness of the code.
