t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; a is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order such that 0 ≤ a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] ≤ 10^9; m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; and each query consists of two distinct integers x and y such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ n.
