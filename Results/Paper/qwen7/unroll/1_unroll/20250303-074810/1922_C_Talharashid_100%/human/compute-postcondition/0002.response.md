Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; a is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order such that 0 ≤ a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] ≤ 10^9; m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; After processing all queries, d1 and d2 are dictionaries where d1[i] contains the value computed from the forward pass and d2[i] contains the value computed from the backward pass for each index i in the list a. The loop processes m queries, each consisting of two distinct integers x and y, and prints the difference between the corresponding values in d1 or d2 based on the query direction.
