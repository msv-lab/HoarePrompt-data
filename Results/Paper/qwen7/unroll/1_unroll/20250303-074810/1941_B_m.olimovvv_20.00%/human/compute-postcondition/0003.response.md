Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers, where the length of the list `n` satisfies 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and each element `a_j` in the list satisfies 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9. Additionally, there is a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) associated with each test case, though `t` is not directly passed as a parameter to the function. The function returns a value based on the list `a` and the integer `t`.**

Note: The exact return value is not specified in the given information, but the function's behavior is described in terms of its input parameters and their constraints.
