Reasoning:
The given solution checks the first and last elements of the array to determine if it's possible to make all elements zero. Specifically, it checks two conditions:
1. If the first element (`b[0]`) is odd and the second element (`b[1]`) is not equal to `b[0] + 2`.
2. If the last element (`b[-1]`) is odd and the second-to-last element (`b[-2]`) is not equal to `b[-1] + 2`.

If either of these conditions is true, the function prints 'NO', indicating that it's not possible to make all elements zero. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

However, the logic in the solution is flawed. The operations described in the problem statement do not necessarily guarantee that the array can be reduced to all zeros just based on the parity (odd/even) of the first and last elements and their adjacent elements. The solution does not account for the overall sum of the array or the possibility of reducing other elements to zero through the operations.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if the sum of the array is divisible by 3 because each operation reduces the sum of the array by 3. If the sum is not divisible by 3, it's impossible to make all elements zero. Additionally, we need to ensure that no element is greater than twice the value of its adjacent elements, which is implicitly checked by the operations.

Given the flawed logic in the provided solution, it does not correctly determine whether it's possible to make all elements zero.

Correctness: **False**
