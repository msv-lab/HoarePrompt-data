Output State: `results` is a list containing the final year after performing the operations described in each test case. For each test case, starting from year 0, the code iterates through a list of integers. If the current year is divisible by the integer, it adds the integer to the current year. Otherwise, it calculates the next year by finding the smallest multiple of the integer that is greater than or equal to the current year. The final year for each test case is appended to the `results` list.
