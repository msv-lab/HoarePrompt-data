Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input and organizes it into test cases.
2. The `func_1` function iterates over each test case and calculates the year when the nth sign will occur.
3. The logic within the function is correct:
   - It initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur.
   - If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, the next year is `current_year + ai`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year` using `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - This ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
4. The function updates `current_year` accordingly and appends the final value to the `results` list.
5. The function returns the list of results, which is then printed in the main part of the program.

Given the logic and the provided example, the program correctly computes the year when the nth sign will occur for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
