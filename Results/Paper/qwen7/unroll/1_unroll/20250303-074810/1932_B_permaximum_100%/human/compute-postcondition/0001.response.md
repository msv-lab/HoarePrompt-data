Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for test in test_cases:`. The variables involved here are `test`, `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions, where each test case description is a tuple containing an integer \(n\) (such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)) and a list of \(n\) integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) (such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\)).

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one element. If `test_cases` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - The variable `test` will take on each element of `test_cases` in sequence during each iteration of the loop.

4. **Formulate the final state**:
   - Since `test_cases` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `test_cases` is non-empty.
   - The initial value of `test` will be the first element of `test_cases`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `test_cases` must have at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), and `test_cases` must have at least one element**.
