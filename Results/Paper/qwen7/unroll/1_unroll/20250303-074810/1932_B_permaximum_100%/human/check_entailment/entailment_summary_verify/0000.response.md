### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to understand its behavior and correctness.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n` and a list of `a_i`).
- For each test case, it initializes `current_year` to 0 and iterates through each `ai` in `a`. It updates `current_year` based on specific conditions to find the next year when the sign will occur.
- The key logic in the function is:
  ```python
  if current_year % ai == 0:
      next_year = current_year + ai
  else:
      next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
  current_year = next_year
  ```
- This logic aims to find the next multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`.

#### Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider the test case mentioned in the original assessment:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  2 4 6
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - First sign occurs in year 2.
  - Second sign occurs in year 6 (2 + 4).
  - Third sign occurs in year 12 (6 + 6).

- Program Output:
  - The program calculates the next year for the second sign as 4 (incorrect).
  - The program calculates the next year for the third sign as 10 (incorrect).

The program's logic is indeed flawed because it does not correctly handle the sequential nature of the signs. The logic should ensure that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the next year is the least common multiple (LCM) of all previously encountered periods. However, the current implementation does not achieve this.

#### Correct Logic:
To correctly find the LCM of all periods, we can use the following approach:
1. Initialize `current_year` to 0.
2. For each period `ai`, update `current_year` to the LCM of `current_year` and `ai`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        (n, a) = test
        current_year = 1
        for ai in a:
            current_year = lcm(current_year, ai)
        results.append(current_year)
    return results
```

With this corrected logic, the program will correctly compute the LCM of all periods, ensuring that the signs occur sequentially.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis and the corrected logic, the original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur sequentially due to the flawed logic.

**Final: False**
