Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. Specifically, the logic used to determine the next year when a sign will occur is flawed. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
1
3
2 4 6
```

- Expected Output:
The first sign occurs every 2 years, so it will occur in year 2. After the first sign, the tribe waits for the second sign, which occurs every 4 years. Since the first sign occurred in year 2, the second sign will occur in year 6 (2 + 4). After the second sign, the tribe waits for the third sign, which occurs every 6 years. Since the second sign occurred in year 6, the third sign will occur in year 12 (6 + 6).

However, the program incorrectly calculates the next year for the second and third signs. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic for this test case:
- For the first sign, `current_year` is 0.
- For the second sign, the program calculates `next_year` as follows:
  - `current_year % 4 == 0` is false, so `next_year = (0 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`.
- For the third sign, the program calculates `next_year` as follows:
  - `current_year % 6 == 0` is true, so `next_year = current_year + 6 = 10`.

This results in an incorrect output of 10, whereas the correct output should be 12. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
