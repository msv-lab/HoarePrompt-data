Output State: **The program returns a list `results` containing the final year `current_year` for each test case after executing the loop. For each test case `(n, a)`, `current_year` is updated based on the conditions inside the inner loop, starting from `0` and iterating through each `ai` in `a`. The final value of `current_year` for each test case is appended to `results`.**

This means that for each test case defined by a tuple `(n, a)`, where `n` is an integer and `a` is a list of integers, the program will update `current_year` starting from `0` and incrementing it by `1` for each element in `a`. After processing all elements in `a`, the final value of `current_year` for that test case will be added to the list `results`. This process is repeated for each test case, and the final `results` list will contain the final `current_year` for each test case.
