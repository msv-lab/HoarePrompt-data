You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
t = int(input().strip())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    test_cases.append((n, a))
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        (n, a) = test
        current_year = 0
        for ai in a:
            if current_year % ai == 0:
                next_year = current_year + ai
            else:
                next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
            current_year = next_year
        results.append(current_year)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). It returns a list `results` containing the final year `current_year` for each test case after executing a loop. For each test case `(n, a)`, `current_year` starts at 0 and iterates through each `ai` in `a`, updating `current_year` based on specific conditions. The final value of `current_year` for each test case is appended to `results`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. Specifically, the logic used to determine the next year when a sign will occur is flawed. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
1
3
2 4 6
```

- Expected Output:
The first sign occurs every 2 years, so it will occur in year 2. After the first sign, the tribe waits for the second sign, which occurs every 4 years. Since the first sign occurred in year 2, the second sign will occur in year 6 (2 + 4). After the second sign, the tribe waits for the third sign, which occurs every 6 years. Since the second sign occurred in year 6, the third sign will occur in year 12 (6 + 6).

However, the program incorrectly calculates the next year for the second and third signs. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic for this test case:
- For the first sign, `current_year` is 0.
- For the second sign, the program calculates `next_year` as follows:
  - `current_year % 4 == 0` is false, so `next_year = (0 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`.
- For the third sign, the program calculates `next_year` as follows:
  - `current_year % 6 == 0` is true, so `next_year = current_year + 6 = 10`.

This results in an incorrect output of 10, whereas the correct output should be 12. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
