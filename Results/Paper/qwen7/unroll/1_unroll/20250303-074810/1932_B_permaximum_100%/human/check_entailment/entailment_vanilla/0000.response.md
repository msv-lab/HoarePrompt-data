Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a_i`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case.
   - It initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai`, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur.
     - If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, the next year is `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year` using `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic for finding the next year when the sign will occur seems correct.
   - The loop iterates through each periodicity, updating `current_year` accordingly.
   - This ensures that the program waits for the first sign to occur before moving to the next one.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the year when all signs will occur.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input:
  ```
  6
  3 2 4 5 9 18
  ```

- Calculation:
  - Start with `current_year = 0`.
  - First sign: `3` (next year is `3`).
  - Second sign: `4` (next year is `4`).
  - Third sign: `4` (next year is `8`).
  - Fourth sign: `5` (next year is `10`).
  - Fifth sign: `9` (next year is `18`).
  - Sixth sign: `18` (next year is `36`).

- Output: `36`

#### Test Case 2:
- Input:
  ```
  5
  1 2 3 4 5
  ```

- Calculation:
  - Start with `current_year = 0`.
  - First sign: `1` (next year is `1`).
  - Second sign: `2` (next year is `2`).
  - Third sign: `3` (next year is `3`).
  - Fourth sign: `4` (next year is `4`).
  - Fifth sign: `5` (next year is `5`).

- Output: `5`

#### Test Case 3:
- Input:
  ```
  5
  1 1 1 1 1
  ```

- Calculation:
  - Start with `current_year = 0`.
  - Each sign occurs every year, so the next year for each sign is `1`.

- Output: `5` (since the last sign occurs in the 5th year)

#### Test Case 4:
- Input:
  ```
  6
  50 30 711 200 503 1006
  ```

- Calculation:
  - Start with `current_year = 0`.
  - First sign: `50` (next year is `50`).
  - Second sign: `50` (next year is `80`).
  - Third sign: `711` (next year is `1012`).
  - Fourth sign: `200` (next year is `1212`).
  - Fifth sign: `503` (next year is `1715`).
  - Sixth sign: `1006` (next year is `2012`).

- Output: `2012`

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the year when all signs will occur sequentially. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
