Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and k such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, and `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The variables `t` and `cases` remain unchanged from their initial state.
