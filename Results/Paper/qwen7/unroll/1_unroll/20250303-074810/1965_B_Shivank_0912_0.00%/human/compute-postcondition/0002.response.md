Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for (n, k) in cases:`. The variables involved here are `n`, `k`, and `cases`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will iterate over each tuple `(n, k)` in the list `cases`. For each tuple, `n` and `k` will take the values of the respective elements in the tuple.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - **`cases`**: This is a list of tuples, and for the loop to execute, it must contain at least one tuple. Each tuple must have two integers `n` and `k` that satisfy the conditions `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`.
   - **`n` and `k`**: These variables will take the values from the tuples in `cases`. Since the loop will iterate over each tuple, `n` and `k` will be set to the values of the current tuple during each iteration.

4. **Other variables**: The variables `t`, `results`, and `sequence` are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments are:

- `cases` must contain at least one tuple.
- Each tuple in `cases` must have two integers `n` and `k` that satisfy the conditions `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`.

Therefore, the final state after adjustment is:

**State: `cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, and each tuple must have two integers `n` and `k` such that `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`.**
