Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `itm` which iterates over the elements of `mex`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `itm`**: Since `itm` is iterating over the elements of `mex`, before the loop starts, `itm` should be set to the first element of `mex`.

3. **Check the initial state of `mex`**: For the loop to execute, `mex` must contain at least one element.

4. **Other variables**: The other variables (`minn`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `used`) are not part of the loop head and their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `itm` should be set to the first element of `mex`.
- `mex` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`itm` is the first element of `mex`, `mex` must contain at least one element**.
