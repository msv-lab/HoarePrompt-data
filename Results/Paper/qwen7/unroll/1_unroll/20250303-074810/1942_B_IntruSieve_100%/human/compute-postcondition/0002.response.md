Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `mex` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `mex`. No changes are made to the values of `t`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
