Output State: **`minn` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `arr`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `mex` is a list containing non-negative integers, `used` is a dictionary with keys as integers and values as booleans.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `minn` will be incremented until it is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and the structure of `used` (being a dictionary) remain unchanged. The list `mex` will contain values that are either `minn` or `abs(arr[i] - minn)` based on the conditions inside the loop.
