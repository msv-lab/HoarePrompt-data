Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not initialized in the loop head; it will be set to 0 initially.
   - `n` is already given as an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `minn` is 0 (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) (this is already given and ensures the loop can potentially execute).
- `arr` is a list of integers (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `mex` is an empty list (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `used` is an empty dictionary (this does not affect the loop execution).

Since `i` will be initialized to 0 and will increment within the loop, the only thing we need to ensure is that `i < n` at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
