You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

    minn = 0
    used = {}

        if arr[i] > 0:

            used[minn] = True

    #State: `minn` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `arr`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `mex` is a list containing non-negative integers, `used` is a dictionary with keys as integers and values as booleans.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: minn is greater than or equal to the maximum value in arr, t remains unchanged, n remains unchanged, arr remains unchanged, mex is iterated over and printed, used remains unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: an empty line
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers `a` for each test case. It calculates and prints a list `mex` which contains non-negative integers. Each element in `mex` represents the smallest non-negative integer not present in the original list `a`. The function does not return any value but prints the elements of `mex` one by one.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to reconstruct a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \), where each element \( a_i \) is defined as \( \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
   - Given \( a_i \), we can determine the MEX up to index \( i \).
   - We need to ensure that the constructed permutation \( p \) matches the given \( a \).

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes variables to keep track of the MEX and used numbers.
   - It iterates through the array \( a \) and constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the MEX values.
   - The logic inside `func_1` seems to correctly handle both positive and negative values of \( a_i \) to determine the MEX and update the used numbers.

4. **Checking the Logic**:
   - When \( a_i > 0 \), it directly appends the current MEX value to the result and updates the used numbers.
   - When \( a_i \leq 0 \), it calculates the MEX by subtracting the absolute value of \( a_i \) from the current MEX and updates the used numbers.
   - This approach ensures that the MEX condition is satisfied for each position in the permutation.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles both positive and negative values of \( a_i \) correctly.
   - It ensures that the constructed permutation \( p \) satisfies the given conditions.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to construct the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).
