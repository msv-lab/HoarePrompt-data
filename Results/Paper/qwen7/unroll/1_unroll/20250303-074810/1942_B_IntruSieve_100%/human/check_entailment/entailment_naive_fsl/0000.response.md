Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a valid permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the MEX value needs to be adjusted due to previously used values.

Let's consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

However, the program generates:
```
0 1 2 3 4
```

This is incorrect because:
- For \( i = 0 \), \( a_0 = \texttt{MEX}([0]) - 0 = 1 \), which is correct.
- For \( i = 1 \), \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1]) - 1 = 1 \), which is correct.
- For \( i = 2 \), \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 2]) - 2 = -1 \), but the program outputs 2, which is incorrect because 2 is already used.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the MEX value is correctly calculated and adjusted for each position. The current implementation does not properly handle the MEX calculation when values are reused.
