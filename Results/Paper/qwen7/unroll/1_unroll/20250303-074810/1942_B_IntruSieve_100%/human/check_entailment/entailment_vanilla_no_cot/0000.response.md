Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to find the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The code attempts to calculate the MEX for each position in the permutation but does not correctly handle the logic for finding the MEX value. Specifically, the code increments `minn` until it finds a value that is not in `used`, which is not the correct approach for calculating MEX.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Negative Values**: The code incorrectly handles negative values in the array \( a \). When \( a_i \) is negative, it should directly use the absolute value of \( a_i + p_i \), but the current implementation does not correctly map this to the permutation \( p \).

3. **Incorrect Permutation Construction**: The code constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the MEX values, but it does not ensure that each integer from 0 to \( n-1 \) appears exactly once in the permutation.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize the permutation with zeros
    perm = [0] * n
    
    # Track which numbers have been used
    used = set()
    
    for i in range(n):
        mex = 0
        while mex in used:
            mex += 1
        
        # Calculate the value of p_i
        p_i = mex - arr[i]
        
        # Ensure p_i is within the valid range
        if p_i < 0 or p_i >= n:
            raise ValueError("Invalid permutation found")
        
        # Assign the value to the permutation
        perm[i] = p_i
        
        # Mark the value as used
        used.add(p_i)
    
    # Output the permutation
    print(' '.join(map(str, perm)))

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This solution correctly calculates the MEX for each position and ensures that each number from 0 to \( n-1 \) is used exactly once in the permutation.
