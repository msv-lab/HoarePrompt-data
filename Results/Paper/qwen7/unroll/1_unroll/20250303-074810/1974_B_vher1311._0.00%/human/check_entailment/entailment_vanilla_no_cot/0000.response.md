Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding logic. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly decode the string. Instead of replacing characters based on their symmetric positions in the sorted unique characters string, it incorrectly inserts new characters into the list of unique characters, which distorts the intended decoding process.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    encoded_to_unique = {encoded_char: unique_char for unique_char, encoded_char in zip(unique_chars, unique_chars[::-1])}
    decoded_str = ''.join(encoded_to_unique[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

In this corrected version:
- We first create a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string.
- We then create a dictionary `encoded_to_unique` that maps each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in the sorted unique characters list.
- Finally, we use this dictionary to decode the string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the dictionary.
