Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding logic. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**: 
   - The function `func_1` aims to decode the string `s` by mapping each character back to its original position in the auxiliary string `unique_chars`. However, it incorrectly replaces characters in the string `s` instead of constructing the original string `s`.
   - The function iterates through `s`, finds the corresponding character in `unique_chars`, and attempts to replace it. This approach is flawed because it modifies `s` directly rather than constructing the decoded string.
   - The logic for updating `j` and handling insertion of new characters is also incorrect. It should not insert new characters into `unique_chars` but rather use `unique_chars` to map each character in `s`.

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - To decode, we need to map each character in the encoded string `s` to its corresponding character in the auxiliary string `r` (which is constructed in reverse order).
   - The correct approach would involve creating a mapping from `unique_chars` to their positions and then constructing the original string `s` by looking up these positions.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
