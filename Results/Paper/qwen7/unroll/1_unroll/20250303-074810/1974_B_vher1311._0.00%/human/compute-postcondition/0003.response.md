Output State: **i is 0, j is -1.**

Explanation: After iterating through the string `s`, the variable `i` will remain at 0 because we only insert characters when `char` is not in `unique_chars`. The variable `j` will be decremented for each character in `unique_chars` that is found in `s`, eventually becoming -1 after all characters in `s` have been processed.
