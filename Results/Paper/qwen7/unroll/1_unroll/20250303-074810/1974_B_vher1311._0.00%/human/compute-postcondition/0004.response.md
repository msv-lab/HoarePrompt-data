Output State: **The program returns an empty string since there are no unique characters to join.**

Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `j` is -1, the code snippet provided does not involve these variables. The code `return ''.join(unique_chars)` suggests that `unique_chars` is expected to be a list of characters. However, no such list is mentioned in the initial state, and there's no operation that would create or modify `unique_chars`. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that `unique_chars` is an empty list, leading to the program returning an empty string.
