Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle all edge cases. Specifically, the logic for determining whether it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves needs refinement. Here’s why:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - If `n == m`, it's trivially possible.
   - If `m > n`, it's impossible because you can never add more cubes than the total moves.
   - If `m == n - 1`, it's possible by removing one cube at the end.
   - For other cases, the current logic incorrectly allows some possibilities that should be disallowed.

2. **General Logic**:
   - The key observation is that the difference between `n` and `m` must be even because every move changes the count by exactly 1 (either adding or removing).

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        if n < m:
            print('No')
        elif (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This version correctly checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for the problem.
