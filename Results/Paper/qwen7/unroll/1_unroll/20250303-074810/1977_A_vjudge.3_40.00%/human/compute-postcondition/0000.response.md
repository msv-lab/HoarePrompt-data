Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, the output state reflects that `t` now holds the value entered by the user, which is guaranteed to be within this range.
