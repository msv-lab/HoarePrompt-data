Output State: Alice or Bob is printed based on the conditions met within each test case. For each test case, if the list `lis` contains only one unique number or does not contain the number 1, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, if there is a gap greater than 1 between any two consecutive numbers in `lis`, 'Bob' is printed if the position of the gap is odd, and 'Alice' is printed otherwise. If no such gap exists, 'Alice' is printed if the length of `lis` is odd, and 'Bob' is printed if it is even.
