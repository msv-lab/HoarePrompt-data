Output State: Alice or Bob will be printed based on the conditions met within each test case. For each test case, if the list `lis` (after sorting and removing duplicates) contains only one unique number or does not contain the number 1, 'Alice' will be printed. Otherwise, if there is a gap greater than 1 between any two consecutive numbers in `lis`, 'Bob' will be printed if the index of that gap is odd, and 'Alice' will be printed if the index is even. If no such gap exists, 'Alice' will be printed if the length of `lis` is odd, and 'Bob' will be printed if the length is even. This process is repeated for each test case specified by `t`.
