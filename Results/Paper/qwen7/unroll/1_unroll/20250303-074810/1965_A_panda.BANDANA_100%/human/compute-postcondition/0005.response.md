Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t, followed by an integer n and a list of n positive integers. It then determines and prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on specific conditions related to the sorted unique elements of the list. If the list contains only one unique number or does not contain the number 1, it prints 'Alice'. If there is a gap greater than 1 between any two consecutive numbers in the sorted unique list, it prints 'Bob' if the position of the gap is odd, and 'Alice' if it is even. If no such gap exists, it prints 'Alice' if the length of the sorted unique list is odd, and 'Bob' if it is even.**
