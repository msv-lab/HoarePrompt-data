Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the smallest nonempty pile has only one stone. According to the problem description, if the smallest nonempty pile has exactly one stone, the player whose turn it is will lose because they cannot remove any stones without making the pile empty. 

Here is a counterexample:

- **Test Case:**
  ```
  1
  3
  1 2 1
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  Bob
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  The program incorrectly outputs `Alice`.

The program checks if `1` is in the list of unique pile sizes (`lis`) and if the length of `lis` is 1, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where the smallest nonempty pile has exactly one stone. This leads to incorrect results in certain cases. Therefore, the program is not correct.
