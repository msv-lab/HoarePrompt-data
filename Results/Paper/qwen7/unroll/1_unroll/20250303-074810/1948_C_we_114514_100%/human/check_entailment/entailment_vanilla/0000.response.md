Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
This function checks if the robot can reach cell `(2, n)` starting from `(1, 1)`.

1. **Initial Check**:
   ```python
   half_n = n // 2
   ```
   This calculates the midpoint of the grid, which is necessary for the loop condition.

2. **Loop through the first half of the grid**:
   ```python
   for i in range(half_n - 1):
       if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'):
           return 'No'
   ```
   - The loop iterates through the first half of the grid.
   - It checks if the arrow in the odd-indexed column of the first row (`row1[2 * i + 1]`) is pointing left (`<`).
   - If this arrow is pointing left, the robot would move to the left, but since we are checking the first half, the robot cannot move to the second half directly from here.
   - Additionally, it checks if the corresponding cells in the second row have arrows pointing left. If both adjacent cells in the second row have arrows pointing left, the robot would get stuck in an infinite loop and cannot reach the last column.

3. **Check the last column**:
   ```python
   if row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<':
       return 'No'
   ```
   - This checks if the last column in the first row has an arrow pointing left and the second-to-last column in the second row also has an arrow pointing left. If both conditions are true, the robot would get stuck and cannot reach the last column.

4. **Return 'Yes' if no blocking conditions are met**:
   ```python
   return 'Yes'
   ```

#### Function `func_2`:
This function reads input and processes each test case using `func_1`.

1. **Read the number of test cases**:
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   ```

2. **Process each test case**:
   ```python
   results = []
   for _ in range(t):
       n = int(input())
       row1 = input()
       row2 = input()
       results.append(func_1(n, row1, row2))
   ```

3. **Print the results**:
   ```python
   print('\n'.join(results))
   ```

### Verification of Correctness

The logic in `func_1` seems to handle the main issue of the robot getting stuck due to arrows pointing left in specific configurations. However, let's verify if it correctly handles all edge cases and scenarios mentioned in the problem statement.

#### Edge Cases:
1. **Arrows pointing outside the grid**: The problem statement guarantees that there are no arrows pointing outside the grid.
2. **Sum of n over all test cases**: The problem statement guarantees that the sum of `n` does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).
3. **n is even**: The problem statement guarantees that `n` is even.

Given these constraints, the function should work correctly for the provided test cases.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, the function `func_1` correctly identifies the conditions under which the robot gets stuck and returns the appropriate result. Therefore, the overall program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
