Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the robot can reach cell `(2, n)` based on the initial positions and directions of the arrows in the grid.
   - It iterates through the first half of the grid (up to `half_n - 1`) and checks if the robot can be blocked from moving to the next column due to arrows pointing left.
   - If any such condition is met, it immediately returns 'No'.
   - After the loop, it checks the last two cells of both rows. If the robot in the first row cannot move to the second row and the robot in the second row cannot move to the end, it returns 'No'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input for multiple test cases and processes each one using `func_1`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the dimensions `n`, the first row of arrows (`row1`), and the second row of arrows (`row2`).
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and appends the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

3. **Overall Program Flow**:
   - The program correctly reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - It processes each test case using the logic defined in `func_1`.
   - The output is formatted correctly and matches the expected format.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic in `func_1` and `func_2` seems to correctly implement the required functionality without any logical errors or missing steps.

Correctness: **True**
