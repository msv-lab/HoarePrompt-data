The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `row1`, and `row2`. It checks if it's possible to pair each character in `row1` with a corresponding character in `row2` such that no two paired characters point at each other. If any invalid pairing is found, it returns 'No'; otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.
