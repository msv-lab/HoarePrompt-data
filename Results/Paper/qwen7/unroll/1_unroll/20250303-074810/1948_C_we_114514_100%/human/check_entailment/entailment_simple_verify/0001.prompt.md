You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes three parameters: `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - It checks if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` based on the movement rules.
   - The function iterates through the first half of the grid (up to `half_n - 1`), checking specific conditions:
     - If the arrow at position `2*i + 1` in `row1` is `<` (pointing left), then the next two positions in `row2` must not both point left (`<`). Otherwise, the robot cannot move past this point.
     - Similarly, it checks the last column for the same condition.
   - If any of these conditions fail, it returns `'No'`. Otherwise, it returns `'Yes'`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - It initializes the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - It calls `func_1` with these values and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The problem states that `n` is even, which is checked implicitly by the loop in `func_1`.
   - The function correctly handles the boundary conditions for the first and last columns.
   - However, the function does not handle all possible paths and scenarios. It only checks certain specific conditions and does not consider all possible movements.

2. **Detailed Logic Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` assumes that the robot can only move to the next cell if the arrow points in the direction of movement. This is correct.
   - However, the function only checks if the robot can move past certain points and does not ensure that the robot can actually reach the final cell `(2, n)`.
   - The function does not account for the possibility that the robot might get stuck in a loop or unable to progress further due to the arrows' directions.

3. **Example Verification**:
   - Let's verify with the provided examples:
     - For the first example (`4` columns):
       - `row1 = ">><<"`
       - `row2 = ">>><"`
       - The function correctly identifies that the robot can reach `(2, 4)`.
     - For the second example (`2` columns):
       - `row1 = "><"`
       - `row2 = "><"`
       - The function correctly identifies that the robot can reach `(2, 2)`.
     - For the third example (`4` columns):
       - `row1 = ">>><"`
       - `row2 = ">><<"`
       - The function incorrectly identifies that the robot can reach `(2, 4)`, but the correct path is blocked.
     - For the fourth example (`6` columns):
       - `row1 = ">><<><"`
       - `row2 = "><>>><"`
       - The function correctly identifies that the robot can reach `(2, 6)`.

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` does not correctly handle all possible scenarios and can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
