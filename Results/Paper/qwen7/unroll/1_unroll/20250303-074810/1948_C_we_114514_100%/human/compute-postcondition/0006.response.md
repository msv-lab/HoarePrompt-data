Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer equal to the input integer.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(n\) is even.
- `row1` and `row2` are strings consisting of exactly \(n\) characters, where each character is either `<` or `>`.
- `results` is a list containing \(t\) elements, each element being the result of calling `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each iteration of the loop.

The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will join all elements in the `results` list into a single string with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). Each element in the `results` list is the result of calling `func_1(n, row1, row2)`.

Since the exact behavior of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact content of each element in the `results` list. However, we know that each element in `results` is the return value of `func_1(n, row1, row2)`.

Therefore, the output will be a series of lines, each representing the return value of `func_1(n, row1, row2)`.

Output: **a series of lines, each line representing the return value of `func_1(n, row1, row2)`**
