Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. The `func_1` function processes the commands as specified:
   - It constructs the list `b` by iterating through the string `s` and appending elements from the start or end of the array `a` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
   - After constructing `b`, it calculates the product of its elements in reverse order, taking the result modulo `m` at each step, and stores these intermediate results in the list `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the reversed list of these intermediate results.
3. The logic for appending elements to `b` based on the commands in `s` is correct.
4. The calculation of the product modulo `m` and storing the intermediate results in `ans` is also correct.
5. The final step of reversing `ans` before returning it ensures that the output matches the required format.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
