#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either `a[l]` (if corresponding `s[i]` is 'L') or `a[r]` (if corresponding `s[i]` is 'R'), with `l` starting at 0 and `r` starting at `n-1`, and moving towards each other based on the characters in `s`. The final positions of `l` and `r` will be `n` (after the loop) since `l` will be incremented until it reaches `n` and `r` will be decremented until it becomes -1.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `p` is the product of all elements in the list `b` taken in reverse order, modulo `m`, and `ans` is a list containing all intermediate results of `p` from each iteration of the loop.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a reversed list of all intermediate results of `p` from each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by iterating through `a` and appending elements from the start or end of `a` based on the characters in `s`. Then, it calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, taking the result modulo `m` at each step, and stores these intermediate results in a list `ans`. Finally, it returns the reversed list of these intermediate results.
