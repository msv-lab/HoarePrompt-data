Reasoning:

1. The given program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the value `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.
3. The function `func_1` is supposed to process the commands and compute the required remainders.
4. In `func_1`, the logic to handle the commands 'L' and 'R' is incorrect. It appends the elements from the array `a` to the list `b` based on the command, but this does not align with the problem statement. According to the problem, the product of the array elements should be computed before each command is processed, and the element should be removed after computing the product.
5. The variable `p` in `func_1` is used to store the product of the remaining elements of the array `a` after each command is processed. This is correct.
6. However, the loop in `func_1` iterates over the list `b` in reverse, which is unnecessary and incorrect because `b` is built by appending elements from `a` based on the commands, not by the remaining elements after each command.
7. The final result should be returned in the correct order, but the current implementation returns the results in reverse order.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
