Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by iterating through `a` and appending elements from the start or end of `a` based on the characters in `s`. Then, it calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, taking the result modulo `m` at each step, and stores these intermediate results in a list `ans`. Finally, it returns the reversed list of these intermediate results.**
