Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it calculates the sequence \(L\) where each element \(m\) represents the count of numbers that can be expressed as \(p \times \text{odd number}\) with \(p\) increasing from 1 upwards, until \(n\) becomes zero.
3. The logic for determining the \(k\)-th card is sound. It iterates over the sequence \(L\) and finds the appropriate segment where \(k\) falls, then calculates the exact card based on the segment's size and position.
4. The program handles the constraints appropriately, including large values of \(n\) and \(k\).

Given the execution summary and the provided example, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Each step aligns with the expected behavior, and the output matches the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
