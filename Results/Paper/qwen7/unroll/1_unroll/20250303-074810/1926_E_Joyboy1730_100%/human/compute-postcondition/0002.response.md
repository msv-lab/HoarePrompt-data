Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed as the loop processes each test case. For each test case, the loop will split an integer `n` into parts `m` until `n` becomes zero, storing these parts in list `L`. Then, it will iterate over `L` to find the position where `k` falls within the cumulative sum of elements in `L`, and print the corresponding value based on the formula \(pow \times (2 \times (k - tot) - 1)\). This process will repeat for each test case defined by `t`.
