Let's reason through the program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **List Construction (`L`):**
   - The list `L` is constructed using a while loop.
   - In each iteration, `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - `n` is then updated by subtracting `m`.
   - This loop continues until `n` becomes zero.
   - The purpose of this loop is to determine how many odd multiples of increasing powers of 2 can be laid down with the available cards.

3. **Finding the k-th Card:**
   - A variable `tot` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the cumulative count of cards laid down.
   - A variable `pow` is initialized to 1 to represent the current power of 2.
   - The program iterates over the list `L` and checks if `k` falls within the range `[tot, tot + a]`.
   - If `k` is within this range, it calculates the k-th card as `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` and prints it.
   - `tot` is updated by adding `a` to it.
   - `pow` is multiplied by 2 to move to the next power of 2.

### Analysis of the Logic:

1. **List Construction (`L`):**
   - The logic correctly identifies how many cards of each type (odd, twice an odd, three times an odd, etc.) can be laid down.
   - However, the construction of `L` might not be necessary for finding the k-th card directly.

2. **Finding the k-th Card:**
   - The logic correctly identifies the range of cards for each power of 2 and finds the exact card within that range.
   - The formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` correctly computes the k-th card for the current power of 2.

### Correctness Check:

Given the example provided:
- For `n = 7` and `k = 1`, the output is `1` (correct).
- For `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the output is `3` (correct).
- For `n = 7` and `k = 3`, the output is `5` (correct).
- For `n = 7` and `k = 4`, the output is `7` (correct).
- For `n = 7` and `k = 5`, the output is `2` (correct).
- For `n = 7` and `k = 6`, the output is `6` (correct).
- For `n = 7` and `k = 7`, the output is `4` (correct).

The program handles the examples correctly, and the logic appears sound.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the k-th card laid down by Vladislav. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
