The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates a sequence \( L \) where each element \( m \) is derived by repeatedly halving \( n \) (with rounding up) until \( n \) becomes zero. It then determines and prints an integer based on the position \( k \) within the cumulative sum of elements in \( L \). The function reads \( t \) test cases from the input, where \( 1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4 \), and \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9 \) for each test case.
