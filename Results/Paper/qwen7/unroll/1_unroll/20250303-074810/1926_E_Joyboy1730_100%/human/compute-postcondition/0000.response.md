Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4**.

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), the output state maintains this condition. All other variables remain unchanged, and no new variables are introduced.
