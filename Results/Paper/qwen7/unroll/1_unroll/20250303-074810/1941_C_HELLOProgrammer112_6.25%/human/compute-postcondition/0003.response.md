Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6). The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^6. For each test case, the function performs some operation on `t` and `s` and returns the result.**

Note: The exact operation on `t` and `s` is not specified in the given information, so the functionality focuses on the structure and constraints of the input rather than the specific operations performed.
