Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). Based on certain conditions, it calculates and prints a result. If \(B \times 2 < C\), it prints \(A \times B\). If \(A\) is even, it prints \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\). Otherwise, it calculates \(X = \frac{A}{2}\) (integer division) and prints \(X \times C + B\). The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.**
