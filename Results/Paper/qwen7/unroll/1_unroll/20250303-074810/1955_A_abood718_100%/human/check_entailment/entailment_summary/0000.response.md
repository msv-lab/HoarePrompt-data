Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that it accurately calculates the minimum cost for Maxim to buy \(n\) yogurts under the given conditions.

1. **Condition \(B \times 2 < C\):**
   - If the cost of two yogurts at the promotion (\(C\)) is less than twice the cost of one yogurt (\(2B\)), it is cheaper to buy in pairs.
   - In this case, the program correctly calculates the total cost as \(A \times B\), which is the cost of buying all yogurts individually since buying in pairs would be more expensive.

2. **Condition \(A\) is even:**
   - If \(A\) is even, the program divides \(A\) by 2 and multiplies by \(C\) to get the cost of buying pairs of yogurts, and then adds \(B\) for the last yogurt if necessary.
   - This is correct because buying \(A/2\) pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt at the regular price will always be the minimum cost when \(A\) is even.

3. **Condition \(A\) is odd:**
   - If \(A\) is odd, the program divides \(A\) by 2 using integer division to get the number of full pairs, multiplies by \(C\) to get the cost of these pairs, and then adds \(B\) for the remaining yogurt.
   - This is also correct because buying as many full pairs as possible and one additional yogurt at the regular price ensures the minimum cost when \(A\) is odd.

Given the logic in the program matches the conditions and calculations described in the problem statement, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
