Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the promotion price for two yogurts (C) is less than twice the price of one yogurt (B), but it should still be beneficial to use the promotion. Specifically, the condition `if B * 2 < C:` is incorrect because it checks if the promotion is worse than buying individually, which is the opposite of what we want. 

For example, consider the input:
```
2 5 9
```
Here, the promotion price for two yogurts (9) is less than twice the individual price (10). The correct output should be 9, but the program incorrectly calculates the cost as 10.

To fix this, the condition should be:
```python
if B * 2 > C:
    # Use the promotion
else:
    # Buy individually
```

This ensures that the promotion is used when it is beneficial, and individual purchases are made otherwise.
