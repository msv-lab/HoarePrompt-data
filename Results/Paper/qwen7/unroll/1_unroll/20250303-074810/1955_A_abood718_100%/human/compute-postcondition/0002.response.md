Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing the result of one iteration of the loop based on the given conditions. For each test case, if \(B \times 2 < C\), it prints \(A \times B\); if \(A\) is even, it prints \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\); otherwise, it calculates \(X = \frac{A}{2}\) (integer division) and prints \(X \times C + B\). The number of lines in the output will be equal to the number of test cases specified by the first input integer \(t\).
