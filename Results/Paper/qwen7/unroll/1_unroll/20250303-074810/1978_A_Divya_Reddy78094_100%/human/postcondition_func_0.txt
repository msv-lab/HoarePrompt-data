The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) indicating the number of test cases, followed by an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers representing the number of pages in each book. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of the second largest number and the last number in the list of pages. The function does not return any value but produces output for each test case.
