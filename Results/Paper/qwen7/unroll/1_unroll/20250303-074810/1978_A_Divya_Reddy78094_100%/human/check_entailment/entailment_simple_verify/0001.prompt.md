You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    4
    
    2 3 3 1
    
    5
    
    2 2 3 2 2
    
    2
    
    10 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 represents the number of pages in each book.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and for each iteration of the loop, `n` is an integer read from input, `nums` is a list of integers obtained by splitting another input string, and the loop prints the sum of the second largest number in `nums` and the last number in `nums`. After all iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, but the printed outputs are the sums calculated for each input list `nums`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the pages of each book `nums`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program calculates `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]` and prints the result.

### Understanding the Logic

- `nums[:-1]` gives all elements of `nums` except the last one.
- `max(nums[:-1])` finds the maximum value among all but the last element.
- `nums[-1]` gives the last element of `nums`.

The logic of the program is to split the books into two piles such that one pile contains all books except the last one, and the other pile contains only the last book. Alice will read the book with the highest number in each pile, so the program is essentially finding the sum of the maximum of the first `n-1` books and the last book.

### Testing the Logic

Let's test the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `2`
   - `1 1`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: The program outputs `max([1]) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `4`
   - `2 3 3 1`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Explanation: The program outputs `max([2, 3, 3]) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `5`
   - `2 2 3 2 2`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Explanation: The program outputs `max([2, 2, 3, 2]) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5`.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `2`
   - `10 3`
   - Expected Output: `13`
   - Explanation: The program outputs `max([10]) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13`.

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `3`
   - `1 2 3`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Explanation: The program outputs `max([1, 2]) + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5`.

### Conclusion

The program logic is correct for the given problem statement. It correctly identifies the maximum number of pages Alice can read by splitting the books into two piles as described.
