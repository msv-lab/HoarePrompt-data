Output State: **A string formed by mapping each character in 'encoded' to its mirrored counterpart in the 'mapping' dictionary.**

Explanation: The code iterates over each character in the `encoded` string and uses the `mapping` dictionary to find the corresponding character at the mirrored index. Since `r` contains each unique character from `encoded` in sorted order and `mapping` maps each character to its mirrored counterpart, the resulting string will be constructed by replacing each character in `encoded` with the character that is symmetrically opposite to it in the sorted order of unique characters.
