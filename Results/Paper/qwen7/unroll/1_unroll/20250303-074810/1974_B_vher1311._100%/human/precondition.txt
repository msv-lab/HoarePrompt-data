encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and encoded is the result of encoding a string s using the described algorithm. The string r, used in the encoding process, consists of all distinct letters of s sorted in alphabetical order.
