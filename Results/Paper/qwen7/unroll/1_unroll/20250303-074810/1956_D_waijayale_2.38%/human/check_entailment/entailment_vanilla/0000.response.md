Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have an array `a` of integers.
   - We can perform operations where we choose a subarray `[l, r]` and set all elements in this subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of the subarray.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

2. **Functions Breakdown**:
   - **func_1**: This function is supposed to set all elements in the subarray `[l, r]` to the MEX of that subarray. However, the implementation seems incomplete and might not work as intended.
   - **func_2**: This function initializes the process and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to maximize the sum of the array.
   - **recursive_maximize_sum**: This function attempts to maximize the sum of the subarray `[l, r]`. If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1)^2\), it sets all elements to \(r - l + 1\). Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively maximizes the left and right parts.
   - **func_3**: This function reads input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - **func_1**: The function is incomplete and does not correctly compute the MEX and update the array.
   - **recursive_maximize_sum**: The logic to find the MEX and update the array is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that setting all elements to the maximum value in the subarray will maximize the sum, which is not always true.
   - **Overall Logic**: The approach to finding the MEX and updating the array is not correct. The MEX should be computed properly, and the array should be updated accordingly to ensure the maximum sum.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the functions, particularly in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum`, the program is not correctly solving the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
