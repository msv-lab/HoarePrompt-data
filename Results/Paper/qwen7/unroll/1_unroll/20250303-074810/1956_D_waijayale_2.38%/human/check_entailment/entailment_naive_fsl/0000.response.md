Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the array elements. Specifically, the `func_3` function is not properly defined and does not call the necessary functions to achieve the desired result. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incomplete Function Definitions**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `recursive_maximize_sum` are defined but not fully utilized within `func_3`. The function `func_2` is supposed to return the maximum sum and the number of operations, but it does not actually call these functions to perform the operations.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is designed to set the subarray from `l` to `r` to the value `r - l + 1` if the current value at `l` is not already `r - l + 1`. However, this function is not called in `func_3`, and thus the operations are not performed.

3. **Lack of Operation Execution**: The `ops` list is not populated with actual operations in `func_3`. The function `func_2` is supposed to return the operations list, but it does not execute them.

Given these issues, the program does not perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the array elements. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem description for at least one potential case, making the program incorrect.
