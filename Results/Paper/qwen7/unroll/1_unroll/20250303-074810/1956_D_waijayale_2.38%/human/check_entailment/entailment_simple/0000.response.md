Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for setting all elements in the subarray from `l` to `r` to the value `r - l + 1` if the first element in the subarray is not already equal to `r - l + 1`.
   - If `l == r` and `a[l]` is not 0, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and records the operation.
   - Otherwise, it recursively processes the subarray starting from `l + 1` and then checks if the first element of the current subarray needs to be updated.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the sum of the array and the operations needed to maximize the sum.
   - It calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)` to start the process from the entire array.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function attempts to maximize the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1` and records the operation.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and splits the subarray into two parts around the maximum element, recursively maximizing each part.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and operations, and prints the results.

### Analysis:

- The logic in `func_1` ensures that the subarray is set to the smallest possible value that maximizes the sum without conflicts.
- The logic in `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum` correctly identifies the optimal strategy to maximize the sum by either setting the entire subarray to a uniform value or splitting the array around the maximum element.
- The implementation handles all edge cases, including when the array is already optimal or when individual elements need to be adjusted.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array using the allowed operations.

Correctness: **True**
