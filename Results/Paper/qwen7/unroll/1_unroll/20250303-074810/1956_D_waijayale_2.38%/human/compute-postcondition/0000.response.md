Output State: **`n` is an input integer, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. However, since no input is provided in the initial state, the value of `n` remains an input integer. The list `a` is not modified by this code, so it retains its initial state where it is a list of `n` integers, each satisfying `0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7`.
