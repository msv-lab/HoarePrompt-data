### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step using the given function summaries and the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to set the subarray from `l` to `r` to the value `r - l + 1` if the current value at `l` is not already `r - l + 1`.
   - It recursively ensures that the subarray is set to the correct value.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to maximize the sum of the array elements and return the maximum sum (`s`), the number of operations (`m`), and the operations list (`ops`).
   - It calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to perform the operations.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function checks if the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
   - If true, it calls `func_1` to set the subarray to the value `r - l + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and recursively calls itself for the left and right parts of the subarray.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and operations, and then prints the results.

Now, let's evaluate the correctness of the program:

- **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly sets the subarray to the desired value when needed.
- **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly calls `recursive_maximize_sum` and returns the required values.
- **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**: This function correctly identifies when to set the subarray to the maximum possible value and recursively ensures the entire array is maximized.
- **Function `func_3`**: This function correctly reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the results.

Based on the function summaries and the problem description, the program appears to follow the correct logic to maximize the sum of the array elements. The program correctly performs the operations as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment incorrectly identified the program as incorrect. The provided program does indeed correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the array elements.

**Final: True**

The program is correct.
