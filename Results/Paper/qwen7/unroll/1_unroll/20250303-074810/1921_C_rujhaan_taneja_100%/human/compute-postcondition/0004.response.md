Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of inputs including an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by `t` sets of integers `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and a list `m` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). For each set, it returns a specific value based on the conditions given.**

This means the function takes no direct parameters but operates on a series of inputs where it processes each of the `t` test cases, each containing `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and a list `m` of length `n`. It then returns a value for each test case based on the specified conditions.
