Output State: The program will execute `test_cases` number of iterations. In each iteration, it will take two lines of input. The first line contains three integers `n`, `f`, and `a`, and the second line contains `n` integers representing the array `arr`. Based on the given conditions, it will print either 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case. After all iterations, the output state will consist of `test_cases` lines, each containing either 'Yes' or 'No'.
