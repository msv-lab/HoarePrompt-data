Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Charge Consumption**: The program incorrectly calculates the charge consumed when turning the phone off and on. Specifically, it uses `b / a` to determine whether turning off and on is beneficial, but this logic is flawed. The correct approach should consider the total charge consumed during intervals between messages and compare it with the charge consumed by turning the phone off and on.

2. **Logic Flaw in Determining Whether to Turn Off and On**: The logic for determining whether to turn off and on the phone is not correctly implemented. The program should calculate the total charge consumed for sending all messages directly and then check if turning the phone off and on would save more charge than the direct consumption.

3. **Summation and Comparison Logic**: The summation of charges and comparison logic is also incorrect. The program should correctly calculate the total charge needed to send all messages and then check if turning the phone off and on can save enough charge to meet the requirement.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[3]
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        # Calculate total charge needed to send all messages directly
        total_charge_needed = sum([max(arr[i] - arr[i-1], 0) * a for i in range(1, n)])
        
        # Calculate minimum charge needed if we turn off and on
        min_charge_needed = f + (n - 1) * b
        
        if total_charge_needed <= min_charge_needed:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This corrected program properly calculates the total charge needed to send all messages both directly and by turning the phone off and on, and then compares these values to determine if it's possible to send all messages without the phone running out of charge.
