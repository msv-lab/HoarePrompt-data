You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

The solution for the first test case can look as follows:

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\) (both between 0 and 99), and a positive integer \(t\) (between 1 and \(10^4\)). For each test case, it calculates a value \(z\) based on \(x\), \(y\), and \(t\), and updates \(z\) if necessary according to specific conditions. After processing all test cases, it prints the final value of \(z\) for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where there are multiple 2x2 icons that cannot fit into the remaining space after placing the 1x1 icons.

Let's consider the following example:
- Input: `12 4`
- Expected output: `2` (since 12 1x1 icons and 4 2x2 icons require 2 screens)

However, the program calculates the number of screens as follows:
1. It calculates `z = (y + 1) // 2`, which is the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into a full screen.
2. It then calculates `m = 15 * z - y * 4`, which seems to be an attempt to account for the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. Finally, it adds `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` to `z` to account for the remaining 1x1 icons.

This approach is flawed because it does not correctly account for the placement of 1x1 icons in the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. For instance, if we have 12 1x1 icons and 4 2x2 icons, the program might incorrectly calculate the number of screens needed.

To illustrate, let's manually check the calculation:
- We need 4 screens for 4 2x2 icons (each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, so 4 screens are needed).
- After placing these 4 2x2 icons, we have 15 - 4 * 4 = 15 - 16 = -1 cells left, which means we need an additional screen for the remaining 12 1x1 icons.

Thus, the correct answer should be 2 screens, but the program might incorrectly calculate this as 1 or more depending on the specific values of `x` and `y`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
