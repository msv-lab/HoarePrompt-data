Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading pairs of integers `(x, y)` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons respectively.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Screens**:
   - For each test case, the program calculates the minimum number of screens needed.
   - The variable `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the screens without considering the 1x1 icons.
   - The formula `m = 15 * z - y * 4` is used to calculate the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons. Here, `15` is derived from the total number of cells in a 5x3 grid (`5 * 3`), and `4` is the number of cells occupied by each 2x2 icon.
   - If `m` (remaining space) is less than `a` (number of test cases), it means there are not enough cells left to fit any more 1x1 icons. In this case, the number of additional screens required is calculated as `z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated number of screens for each test case.

### Detailed Calculation Verification

Let's verify the logic with the example provided:

- **Test Case 1**: 
  - Input: `1 1`
  - `z = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 1 * 4 = 11`
  - Since `m = 11` and `a = 1`, we need to check if `x - m + 15 - 1` is positive.
  - `x - m + 15 - 1 = 1 - 11 + 15 - 1 = 4`, so we need an additional screen.
  - Result: `1 + 1 = 2` (but the expected output is `1`).

- **Test Case 2**: 
  - Input: `7 2`
  - `z = (2 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 2 * 4 = 7`
  - Since `m = 7` and `a = 1`, we need to check if `x - m + 15 - 1` is positive.
  - `x - m + 15 - 1 = 7 - 7 + 15 - 1 = 12`, so we need an additional screen.
  - Result: `1 + 1 = 2` (but the expected output is `1`).

- **Test Case 3**: 
  - Input: `12 4`
  - `z = (4 + 1) // 2 = 2`
  - `m = 15 * 2 - 4 * 4 = 22`
  - Since `m = 22` and `a = 1`, we need to check if `x - m + 15 - 1` is positive.
  - `x - m + 15 - 1 = 12 - 22 + 15 - 1 = 4`, so we need an additional screen.
  - Result: `2 + 1 = 3` (but the expected output is `2`).

From these examples, it is clear that the program does not correctly handle the placement of 1x1 icons. Specifically, the calculation of the remaining space and the additional screens required is flawed.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for all test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
