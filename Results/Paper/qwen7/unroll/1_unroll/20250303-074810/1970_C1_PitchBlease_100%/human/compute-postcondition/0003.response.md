Output State: `tree` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, with each key being a node and its value being a list of nodes connected to it by an edge; `n` remains an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, `edges` remains a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, and `start` remains an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed.

In this output state, the `tree` defaultdict will have been updated such that for each edge (u, v) in the `edges` list, both u and v will have each other added to their respective lists in `tree`. This effectively constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree.
