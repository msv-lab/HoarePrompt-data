The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (representing the tree's edges), and `start` (the initial node where the stone is placed). It constructs the tree structure, identifies the two leaves, calculates the shortest distances from the start node to each leaf using BFS, and checks if either distance is odd. If an odd distance is found, it returns 'Ron'; otherwise, it returns 'Hermione'.
