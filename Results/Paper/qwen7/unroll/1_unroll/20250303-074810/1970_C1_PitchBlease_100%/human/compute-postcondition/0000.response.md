Output State: **queue is a deque containing (start, 0), start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, target is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, and tree is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring nodes.**

Explanation: The code initializes a queue using collections.deque() with a single tuple `(start, 0)`. This tuple represents the starting node (`start`) and the distance from the start node, which is initially 0. The values of `target` and `tree` remain unchanged.
