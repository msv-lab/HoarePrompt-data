Output State: `tree` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and its value is a dictionary where each key represents a node in the tree, and the corresponding value is a list of nodes connected to it by an edge. The `n` and `start` variables retain their initial values, with `n` being the number of nodes in the tree and `start` being the initial node where the stone is placed.
