Output State: The output state consists of "YES" or "NO" printed for each query in the range specified by `m` queries. For each query `(a, b)`, if the number of 1s in the subarray `l[a-1:b+1]` is greater than or equal to half the length of the subarray when the subarray's sum minus its length is non-positive, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
