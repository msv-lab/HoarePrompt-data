You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5. c is a list of n positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n for each query.

    #State: Output State: The output state consists of "YES" or "NO" printed for each query in the range specified by `m` queries. For each query `(a, b)`, it checks if the number of 1s in the subarray `l[a-1...b]` is more than half the length of the subarray. If true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of queries on a given list `c`. It reads the list `c` and a number of queries from standard input. For each query defined by a pair of indices `(a, b)`, it calculates the count of the integer `1` within the subarray `c[a-1...b]` and compares it to half the length of the subarray. If the count of `1`s is greater than half the length of the subarray, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value but prints the result for each query.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, followed by the array `l` of length `n`.

2. **Preprocessing the Array:**
   - It initializes two lists `p` and `c`.
   - `p[i]` stores the cumulative sum up to index `i-1` of the array `l`.
   - `c[i]` stores the count of 1s up to index `i-1` of the array `l`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it reads the indices `a` and `b` which define the subarray.
   - It calculates the count of 1s (`i`) and the sum (`s`) of the subarray defined by `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the subarray is good based on the conditions:
     - The subarray must have more than one element.
     - The sum of the subarray should be at least equal to the count of 1s plus the number of elements minus 1.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Cumulative Sum and Count of 1s:**
   - The cumulative sum `p` and count of 1s `c` are correctly calculated.
   - This preprocessing helps in efficiently calculating the sum and count of 1s for any subarray.

2. **Checking Subarray Conditions:**
   - The condition `if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:` is used to check if the subarray is good.
   - Here, `s - (b - a + 1)` represents the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray.
   - The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that the sum of the subarray is at least the count of 1s plus the number of elements minus 1, which aligns with the problem statement.

### Correctness Verification

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the conditions for determining if a subarray is good are correctly checked. The program handles the preprocessing and query processing efficiently.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the provided conditions.
