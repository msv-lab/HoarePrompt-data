Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for swapping digits to maximize the product of `x` and `y` is flawed. The current implementation only performs one pass through the digits and does not ensure that the largest possible digits are swapped optimally across both numbers.

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
3
98
89
```

Expected Output:
```
99
88
```

However, the program's output will be:
```
89
98
```

This is because the program only checks for equal digits initially and swaps them, but it does not ensure that the largest digits are swapped optimally between the two numbers. For instance, in the example above, the program should swap the '9' from `x` with the '8' from `y` to get `99` and `88`, which maximizes the product.

Therefore, the program does not always produce the correct result and hence is incorrect.
