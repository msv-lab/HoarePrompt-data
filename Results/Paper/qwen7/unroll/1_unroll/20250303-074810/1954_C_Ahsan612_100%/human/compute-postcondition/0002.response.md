Output State: The output state consists of two strings of digits. For each iteration of the loop, a new string `new` and `new2` are generated based on the comparison of two input strings `a` and `b`. The first string `new` contains the maximum value at each position where `a` and `b` differ or when they are different from the previous matching pair. The second string `new2` contains the minimum value at each position where `a` and `b` differ or when they are different from the previous matching pair. After all iterations, the final `new` and `new2` strings are printed.
