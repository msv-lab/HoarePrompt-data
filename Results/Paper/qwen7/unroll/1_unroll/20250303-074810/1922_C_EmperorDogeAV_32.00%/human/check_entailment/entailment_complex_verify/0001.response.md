### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line, where the cost of moving to the closest city is 1 coin, and the cost of moving directly to another city is the absolute difference in their positions.

2. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the positions of the cities, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then calculates the closest city for each city using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function incorrectly determines the closest city. It sets `back` to `-99999999` and `forward` to `99999999` at the start, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.
   - It then checks if the forward city is closer than the backward city and assigns values accordingly.
   - The `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` lists are used to store prefix sums of the distances to the closest cities.
   - For each query, it uses these prefix sums to calculate the minimum cost to travel from one city to another.

3. **Issues with the Code**:
   - The `func_1` function does not correctly identify the closest city for each city. It should find the city that minimizes the absolute distance, but the current logic is flawed.
   - The prefix sums are calculated based on the incorrect closest city distances, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the `func_1` function is actually correctly identifying the closest city for each city. Hereâ€™s why:

- The function iterates through each city and compares the distance to the previous and next city.
- If the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city (or if there is no previous city), it sets the value to 1, indicating the next city is the closest.
- Otherwise, it sets the value to the distance to the next city.

This logic correctly identifies the closest city for each city, as required by the problem statement. The rest of the code correctly uses these closest city distances to compute the prefix sums and handle the queries.

Given this analysis, the original assessment was incorrect because the `func_1` function does indeed correctly identify the closest city for each city.
