Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line, where the coordinates are in strictly increasing order (i.e., 0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and there are m queries, where each query consists of two distinct indices x and y such that 1 <= x, y <= n and x != y.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999
        
        forward = 99999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `cities` is a list of integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line, and `prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the forward city coordinate and the current city coordinate, based on the condition inside the loop. Specifically, for each index `i` from 0 to n-2, if the difference between the forward city coordinate and the current city coordinate is less than the difference between the current city coordinate and the backward city coordinate (if available), then `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference between the forward and current city coordinates.
    return prog_cities
    #`prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the forward city coordinate and the current city coordinate, based on the condition inside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `cities` representing the coordinates of \( n \) cities on a number line in strictly increasing order and an integer \( n \) indicating the number of cities. It returns a new list `prog_cities` of length \( n-1 \). For each index \( i \) from 0 to \( n-2 \), the function sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 if the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city (if available); otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the absolute difference between the coordinates of the next and current cities.
