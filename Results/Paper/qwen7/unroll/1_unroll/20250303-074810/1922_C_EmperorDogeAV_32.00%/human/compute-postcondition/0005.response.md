Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `cities`, which is a list of integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line in strictly increasing order, and `n`, which is the number of cities. It returns a list `prog_cities` of length n-1, where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the forward city coordinate and the current city coordinate, based on the condition inside the loop.**
