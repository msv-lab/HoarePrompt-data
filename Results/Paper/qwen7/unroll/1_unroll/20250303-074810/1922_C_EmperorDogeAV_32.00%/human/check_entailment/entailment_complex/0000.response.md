Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to travel between any two cities on a number line, considering the unique closest city rule and the two types of travel actions (travel to any city or travel to the closest city).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` computes a list `prog_cities` of length \( n-1 \) where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the forward city coordinate and the current city coordinate.
   - This computation is based on whether the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city (if available).
   - The logic is correct for determining the closest city for each city based on the given constraints.

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly reverses the `cities` list to compute `backward_cities` using `func_1`.
   - It calculates prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) for efficient query processing.
   - For each query, it determines the minimum cost based on whether the start city index is less than the end city index or vice versa.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints and edge cases are handled appropriately, ensuring the program works within the specified limits.
   - The logic for handling queries is sound and follows the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
