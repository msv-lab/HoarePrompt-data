Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the closest city. The `func_1` function attempts to determine the closest city by comparing the distances to the previous and next city, but it does not correctly handle the unique closest city condition specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function does not ensure that for every city, the closest city is unique. This can lead to incorrect results, especially in cases where the cities are densely packed or have specific spacing that violates the unique closest city condition.

For example, consider the cities located in points `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`. According to the problem description, the closest city to city 1 is city 2, to city 2 is city 3, to city 3 is city 4, to city 4 is city 3, and to city 5 is city 4. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly identify these closest cities, leading to incorrect results for the queries.
