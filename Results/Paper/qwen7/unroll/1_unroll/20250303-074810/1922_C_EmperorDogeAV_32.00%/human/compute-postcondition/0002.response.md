Output State: `cities` is a list of integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line, and `prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the forward city coordinate and the current city coordinate. Specifically, for each index i (0 <= i <= n-2), if the distance to the forward city is less than the distance to the back city, then `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference between the forward city coordinate and the current city coordinate.
