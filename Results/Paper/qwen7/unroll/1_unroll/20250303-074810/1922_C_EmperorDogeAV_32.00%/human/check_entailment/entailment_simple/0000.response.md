Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves finding the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line, where the cost depends on the closest city to the current city.
2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It calculates the "closest city" information for each city and stores it in `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`.
   - It uses prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) to quickly compute the sum of these closest city differences.
   - For each query, it determines whether to use the forward or backward prefix sums based on the relative positions of the start and end cities.
3. **Key Function `func_1`**:
   - This function computes the "closest city" information for each city.
   - It iterates through each city and checks the distance to the next and previous cities to decide whether the next city is closer or the distance to the next city itself.
   - The logic seems correct for determining the closest city based on the given conditions.
4. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sums are correctly computed and used to find the minimum cost efficiently.
   - The logic for determining which prefix sum to use (forward or backward) is also correct.
5. **Query Processing**:
   - The queries are processed correctly using the precomputed prefix sums.
   - The output is generated based on the minimum cost calculated using the closest city information.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
