#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line, where the coordinates are in strictly increasing order (i.e., 0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and there are m queries, where each query consists of two distinct indices x and y such that 1 <= x, y <= n and x != y.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999
        
        forward = 99999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `cities` is a list of integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line, and `prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the forward city coordinate and the current city coordinate, based on the condition inside the loop. Specifically, for each index `i` from 0 to n-2, if the difference between the forward city coordinate and the current city coordinate is less than the difference between the current city coordinate and the backward city coordinate (if available), then `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference between the forward and current city coordinates.
    return prog_cities
    #`prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the forward city coordinate and the current city coordinate, based on the condition inside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `cities` representing the coordinates of \( n \) cities on a number line in strictly increasing order and an integer \( n \) indicating the number of cities. It returns a new list `prog_cities` of length \( n-1 \). For each index \( i \) from 0 to \( n-2 \), the function sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 if the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city (if available); otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the absolute difference between the coordinates of the next and current cities.
