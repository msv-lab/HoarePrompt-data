Output State: **`cities` is a list of integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line, where the coordinates are in strictly increasing order, n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and there are m queries, where each query consists of two distinct indices x and y such that 1 <= x, y <= n and x != y; `prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 initialized with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `prog_cities` with `n-1` zeros. This means that `prog_cities` is now a list of length `n-1` where every element is `0`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
