Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers written on the whiteboard are 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. After executing the loop, the score for each test case is calculated as the sum of the smallest element and every other subsequent smallest element from the sorted list of 2n integers.
