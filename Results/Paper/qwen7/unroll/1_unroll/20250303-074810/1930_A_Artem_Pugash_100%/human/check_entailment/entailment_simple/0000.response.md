Reasoning:
The given program aims to find the maximum score by pairing the smallest available numbers together in each iteration. Here's a breakdown of the logic and steps involved:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting the List**: It sorts the list of integers. Sorting ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together, which maximizes the score since the score is based on the minimum of each pair.

3. **Calculating Score**: The program then iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, summing up the first element of each pair (i.e., `l[i]`). This is because, in each iteration, the minimum of the pair (which is `l[i]`) is added to the score.

4. **Outputting Result**: Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, this approach correctly calculates the maximum possible score by always pairing the smallest available numbers, ensuring that the score is maximized.

Correctness: **True**
