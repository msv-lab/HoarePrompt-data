### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the solution and provides a thorough analysis. Let's break down the reasoning again to ensure everything aligns with the problem statement and the provided annotations.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list of integers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - This is essential because the optimal strategy involves pairing the smallest available numbers to maximize the score.

3. **Scoring**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2 (`range(0, 2 * n, 2)`).
   - It adds the elements at even indices to the score. Since the list is sorted, these elements are the smallest available numbers.

4. **Output**:
   - The score is printed for each test case.

### Key Points to Validate

- **Optimal Strategy**: Pairing the smallest numbers first is indeed the optimal strategy.
- **Correct Iteration**: The iteration through the sorted list in steps of 2 correctly pairs the smallest numbers.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles all given constraints and examples correctly.

### Detailed Validation Using Annotations

- **State Before Function Call**: The program starts with reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
- **Sorting**: The list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- **Scoring**: The program iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the elements at even indices to the score.
- **Output**: The score is printed for each test case.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy by sorting the list and then summing the first element of each pair in the sorted list. This approach ensures that the smallest numbers are paired first, maximizing the score.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
