Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of integers based on the constraints provided (t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers written on the whiteboard are 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). It returns a result based on the processed integers.**
