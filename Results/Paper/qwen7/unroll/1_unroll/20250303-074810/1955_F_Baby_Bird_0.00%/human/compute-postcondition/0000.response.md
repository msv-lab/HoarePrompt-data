Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used in the range function, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the state needed for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as the input value is a positive integer. Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the input value (which will be stored in the range function) is a positive integer within the given range.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that will be used in the range function.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
