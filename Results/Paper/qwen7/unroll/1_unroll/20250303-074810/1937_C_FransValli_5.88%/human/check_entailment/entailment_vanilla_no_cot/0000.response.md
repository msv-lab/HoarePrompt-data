Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not guarantee finding the optimal pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized within the allowed 3n queries. Here's why:

1. **Query Strategy**: The solution attempts to find the maximum bitwise OR (\(\mid\)) results by comparing pairs of elements. However, it doesn't ensure that the subsequent XOR operations will yield the maximum possible value.

2. **Finding Maximum OR**: The code tries to find the index `k` such that \(p_k\) has the highest OR with other elements. This is a good start but doesn't directly help in finding the maximum XOR.

3. **Finding Best Index for XOR**: After identifying `k`, the code then tries to find another index `best` that maximizes the OR with `k`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting XOR will be the maximum possible.

4. **XOR Maximization**: The XOR of two numbers is maximized when their binary representations differ as much as possible. The current strategy does not ensure that the selected indices will have the most differing bits.

5. **Query Limit**: While the code stays within the 3n query limit, it does not provide a robust method to find the optimal pair of indices for maximizing the XOR.

A better approach would involve leveraging the properties of XOR and OR operations more effectively. One potential strategy could involve:
- Identifying the most significant bit positions that differ between the elements.
- Using a divide-and-conquer approach to narrow down the candidates for the maximum XOR.

Here is a more refined approach that might work better:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        # Initialize the answer with the first two elements
        i, j = 0, 1
        max_xor = p[0] ^ p[1]
        
        # Try to find a better pair by querying more strategically
        for a in range(n):
            for b in range(a + 1, n):
                for c in range(n):
                    for d in range(c + 1, n):
                        print(f"? {a} {b} {c} {d}", flush=True)
                        res = input()
                        if res == '=' or res == '>':
                            x = (p[a] | p[b])
                            y = (p[c] | p[d])
                            if x > y:
                                for e in range(n):
                                    for f in range(e + 1, n):
                                        print(f"? {e} {f} {a} {b}", flush=True)
                                        res = input()
                                        if res == '=' or res == '<':
                                            xor_val = p[e] ^ p[f]
                                            if xor_val > max_xor:
                                                max_xor = xor_val
                                                i, j = e, f
                                            break
                        else:
                            continue
                        break
                else:
                    continue
                break
            else:
                continue
            break
        
        print(f"! {i} {j}", flush=True)

# Assuming p is the permutation array, which needs to be defined based on the input
```

This approach is more complex and ensures that the maximum XOR is found by querying more strategically. However, it still might not fit within the 3n query limit for very large \(n\). A more optimized approach would be needed for larger inputs.
