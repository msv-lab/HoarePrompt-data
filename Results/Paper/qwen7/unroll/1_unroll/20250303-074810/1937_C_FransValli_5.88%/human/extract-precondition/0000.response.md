Precondition: **None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the function signature. However, the problem description implies that the function interacts with an external entity to perform queries and obtain responses. The input variables are n (an integer representing the size of the permutation), and the permutation itself (though it is not directly passed as an argument to the function).**
