State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `_` is 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is used in the loop head, but it is typically an internal counter that starts from 0 and increments with each iteration. Since the loop will start with `_` being 0, we can directly set `_` to 0.
- The variable `t` represents the number of test cases, and for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is within the given range (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4).

Thus, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
