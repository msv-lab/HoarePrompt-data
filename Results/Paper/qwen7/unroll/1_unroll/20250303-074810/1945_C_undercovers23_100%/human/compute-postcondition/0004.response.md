Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through test cases where t is an integer between 1 and 20,000 (inclusive), and for each test case, n is an integer between 3 and 300,000 (inclusive), and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300,000. The function returns a result based on the given inputs for each test case.**
