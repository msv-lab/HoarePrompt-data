Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of zeros and ones with the same length as the number of elements in the lists of `d`, an integer key `da` present in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` of integers with the same length as the number of keys in the dictionary `d`. It returns 1 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the value of `tmp` incremented by 1, where `tmp` is the minimum value between the initial `tmp` (1000000000) and the values returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is initially 0 and then reverted to 0; `rank[da - 1]` is `tmp + 1`.**
