Output State: **`max_index` is the index of the first character '<' found in the sequence from index 0 to n-1 when calling `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`, or remains 0 if no such character exists; `min_indices` is a list containing the value of `max_index`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `min_indices` as a list containing the value of `max_index`. The value of `max_index` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is defined as the index of the first character '<' found in the sequence from index 0 to n-1 when calling `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`, or 0 if no such character exists. Therefore, `min_indices` is a list with a single element, which is the value of `max_index`.
