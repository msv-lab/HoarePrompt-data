Output State: `max_index` is the index of the first character '<' found in the sequence from index 0 to n-1 when calling `func_1(0, 0, 0, i)`, or remains 0 if no such character exists; `min_indices` is a list containing the indices of all characters '<' found in the sequence from index 0 to n-1 when calling `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` for each iteration of `i` from 0 to n-1. If no character '<' is found, `min_indices` will be an empty list.
