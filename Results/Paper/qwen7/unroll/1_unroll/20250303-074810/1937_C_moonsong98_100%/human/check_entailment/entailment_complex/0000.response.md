Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly prints a query and waits for the user's response, which is essential for interacting with the judge. It also flushes the output buffer to ensure the query is sent immediately.
2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function correctly prints the final answer and flushes the output buffer. However, it does not return any value, which is fine since the problem does not require returning anything.
3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function aims to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the logic:
   - It starts by identifying the first index `max_index` where the query `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` results in `<`. This step ensures that `max_index` is the first index that produces a smaller result compared to the reference query `func_1(0, 0, 0, i)`.
   - It then collects all indices `i` where `func_1(max_index, 0, max_index, i)` results in `<` and stores them in `min_indices`. This step helps in narrowing down the potential candidates for the maximum XOR.
   - It further refines `min_indices` to exclude indices that are equal to `max_index`.
   - Finally, it selects the minimum index from the refined `min_indices` and prints the result using `func_2`.

However, there are some issues with the logic:
- The logic for finding `max_index` and `min_indices` might not always correctly identify the optimal pair `(i, j)` that maximizes `p_i ⊕ p_j`. The approach relies on the order of comparisons and might miss the optimal pair if the sequence of comparisons does not align with the desired outcome.
- The function assumes that the first occurrence of `<` in the sequence is the best candidate, which might not be true in all cases.

Given these points, the function might not always find the correct pair of indices that maximize the XOR. Therefore, the provided implementation is not guaranteed to be correct for all possible permutations.

Correctness: **False**
