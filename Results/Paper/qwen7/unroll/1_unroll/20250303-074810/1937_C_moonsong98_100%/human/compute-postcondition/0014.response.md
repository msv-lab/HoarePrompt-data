Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the object `min_indices`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in `min_indices`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `min_indices` must contain at least one element.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over `i` in `min_indices`, `min_indices` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `i` will be the first element of `min_indices` during the first iteration, but we don't need to specify this explicitly since the loop will start as long as `min_indices` is non-empty.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `min_indices` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect this condition.

**State: **`min_indices` must contain at least one element**
