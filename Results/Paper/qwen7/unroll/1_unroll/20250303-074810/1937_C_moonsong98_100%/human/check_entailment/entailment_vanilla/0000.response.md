Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `n` from the input, which represents the size of the permutation.
   - For `n = 2`, it directly outputs the indices `[0, 1]` without further queries. This part is correct for `n = 2`.

2. **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair:**
   - The program initializes `max_index` to `0`.
   - It iterates through the indices from `0` to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_0 | p_max_index)` with `(p_0 | p_i)`. If the result is `<`, it updates `max_index` to `i`.
   - This step correctly identifies the index `max_index` such that `p_0 | p_max_index` is maximized.

3. **Finding the Minimum Index:**
   - It initializes `min_indices` with `max_index`.
   - It iterates through the indices from `0` to `n-1` again and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_max_index | p_min_indices[0])` with `(p_max_index | p_i)`. If the result is `<`, it updates `min_indices` to `[i]`. If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `min_indices`.
   - This step aims to find the smallest index among those that have the same result as `max_index` when compared with `p_max_index`.

4. **Final Selection of Indices:**
   - It selects `min_index` from `min_indices` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_min_index | p_min_index)` with `(p_min_index | p_i)` for each `i` in `min_indices`. If the result is `=`, it updates `min_index` to `i`.
   - This step ensures that `min_index` is the smallest index among those that have the same result as `max_index` when compared with `p_max_index`.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - It finally outputs the pair `[max_index, min_index]` using `func_2`.

### Correctness Verification

1. **Handling `n = 2`:**
   - The program correctly handles the base case `n = 2` by directly outputting `[0, 1]`.

2. **General Case (`n > 2`):**
   - The logic for finding `max_index` is correct. It correctly identifies the index `max_index` such that `p_0 | p_max_index` is maximized.
   - The logic for finding `min_indices` is also correct. It correctly identifies the smallest index among those that have the same result as `max_index` when compared with `p_max_index`.
   - The final selection of `min_index` is correct. It ensures that `min_index` is the smallest index among those that have the same result as `max_index` when compared with `p_max_index`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the strategy to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized using at most `3n` queries. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
