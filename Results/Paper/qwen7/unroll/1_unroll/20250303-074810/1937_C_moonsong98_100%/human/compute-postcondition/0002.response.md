Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and the current value of n is 2, `func_2(0, 1)` has been called.**

The function `func_2(0, 1)` has been called with arguments `0` and `1`. However, since no further details about the function's implementation are provided, the values of `n` remain unchanged from its initial state. The function call itself does not alter the value of `n`, which remains as an input integer within the specified range, specifically with the current value of `2`.
