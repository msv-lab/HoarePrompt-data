Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict where all values are lists containing edges from each node to its neighbors based on user inputs, `rev` is a defaultdict where all values are lists containing reverse edges for each node to its neighbors based on user inputs, `z` is an integer from the input, `tmp` is equal to `z`, `one` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `one` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This assignment does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
