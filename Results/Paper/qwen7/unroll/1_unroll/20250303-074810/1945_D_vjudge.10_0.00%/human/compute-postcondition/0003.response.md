Output State: `custos` is a list containing the cumulative cost calculated for each test case after executing the loop. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `x` is equal to the number of test cases. For each test case, `custo` accumulates the cost based on the conditions specified in the loop, and this value is appended to `custos`.
