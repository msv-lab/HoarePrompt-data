Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(x)`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: When the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0 because `range(x)` generates numbers from 0 to x-1.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < x`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `x` for the loop to continue executing.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to adjust the state such that `i` is 0 and `i` is less than `x`.

Given these points, the initial state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

**State:**
**`i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0**
