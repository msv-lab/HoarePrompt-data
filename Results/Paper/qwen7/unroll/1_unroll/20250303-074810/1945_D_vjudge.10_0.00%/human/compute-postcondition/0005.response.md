Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State before the loop starts**: `custos` is a list containing the cumulative cost calculated for each test case after executing the loop. Each element in the list represents the final value of `custo` for that specific test case, based on the given inputs `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, and `b_values`.
- **For Loop**: 
  ```python
  for c in custos:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `c`, which is an iterator over the elements in the list `custos`.
2. **List Iteration**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `custos`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Variable `c`**: In each iteration of the loop, `c` takes the value of an element from the list `custos`. Since `c` is an iterator over the elements of `custos`, we don't need to explicitly set its initial value; it will take the values from the list during each iteration.
2. **List `custos`**: The list `custos` contains the cumulative costs for each test case. For the loop to execute, `custos` must contain at least one element (otherwise, the loop would not run).

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the state of the list `custos`. Specifically, `custos` must contain at least one element.

### Final Answer:
State: **`custos` is a list containing the cumulative cost and must have at least one element**.
