Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `x`.
   - It then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue `num_fila` and the maximum allowable final position `max_p`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes `custo` (total cost) to 0.
   - It initializes `max_p` (maximum allowable final position) to the value read from the input.
   - It initializes empty lists `a_values` and `b_values` to store the costs `a_i` and `b_i` for each person in the queue.

3. **Reading Input Values**:
   - It reads the values of `a_i` and `b_i` for each person in the queue and appends them to the respective lists `a_values` and `b_values`.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `max_p` positions.
   - It starts from the last person in the queue (`num_fila - 1`) and moves backward to the `max_p - 1` position.
   - For each position `y`, it checks whether moving to the next position would cost less than staying at the current position. If so, it adds the appropriate cost to `custo`.
   - It handles edge cases where `y` is 1 or when it reaches the start of the queue.

5. **Output**:
   - After calculating the total cost for each test case, it prints the result.

### Correctness Check

- **Logic**: The logic in the program seems to correctly calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `max_p` positions. It considers both `a_i` and `b_i` costs appropriately.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `y` is 1 or when it reaches the start of the queue.
- **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the input values and processes them as required.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic and handling of the input and output are correct according to the problem statement.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
