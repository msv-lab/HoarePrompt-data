Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the number of diagonals `k` is less than `4 * n - 2`. In such cases, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of cells to color using the formula `ceil(k / 2)` instead of considering the actual constraints.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input: `2 3`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Program Output: `2`

This case works correctly. However, consider another case:
- Input: `3 10`
- Expected Output: `6`
- Program Output: `5`

The program incorrectly calculates the result as `5` instead of `6`. This happens because the condition `4 * n - 2 == k` is not met, and the program uses `ceil(k / 2)` which is insufficient when `k` is close to but less than `4 * n - 2`.

To fix this, the program should ensure that it handles all cases correctly by checking if `k` is less than `4 * n - 2` and then calculating the minimum number of cells accordingly.
