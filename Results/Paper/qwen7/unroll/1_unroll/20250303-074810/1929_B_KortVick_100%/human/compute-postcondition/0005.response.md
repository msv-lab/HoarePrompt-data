Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \). If \( 4n - 2 \) equals \( k \), it prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \); otherwise, it prints \( \left\lceil \frac{k}{2} \right\rceil \). The function reads \( t \) test cases, where \( t \) is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and for each test case, it outputs one line based on the conditions specified.**
