You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of non-negative integers, and n is an integer representing the length of the list.
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: Output State: The list remains unchanged, and the value of n remains unchanged. The loop checks each element in the list; if any element is not zero, it returns False. If all elements are zero, it never returns and completes all iterations, but no changes are made to the list or n.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all elements in the list are zero.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `list` is a list of integers representing the array `a`, and `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Each element in the list is an integer in the range [0, 10^9].
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
    #State: Output State: The list will be transformed such that for every element at index `i` (where 1 < i < n-1), if `list[i]` was greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` were greater than 0, then `list[i]` will be reduced by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i-1]` will be reduced by itself, and `list[i+1]` will be reduced by the value of `list[i-1]`. This process continues until the condition `list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0` is no longer satisfied for any `i`. The elements at the boundaries (`list[0]` and `list[n-1]`) remain unchanged throughout the process.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The list remains unchanged, all elements are integers, and for every element at index \(i\) (where \(1 < i < n-1\)), if \(list[i] > 1\) and both \(list[i-1] > 0\) and \(list[i+1] > 0\), then \(list[i]\) is reduced by twice the value of \(list[i-1]\), \(list[i-1]\) is reduced by itself, and \(list[i+1]\) is reduced by the value of \(list[i-1]\). This process continues until the condition \(list[i] > 1\) and \(list[i - 1] > 0\) and \(list[i + 1] > 0\) is no longer satisfied for any \(i\). The elements at the boundaries (\(list[0]\) and \(list[n-1]\)) remain unchanged throughout the process. The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `True` if the transformation is applied, otherwise the list remains unchanged.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not properly handle the decrement operations according to the rules specified. 

For instance, consider the following test case:
- Input: 
  ```
  5
  1 3 5 5 2
  ```

The expected steps to make all elements zero would be:
1. Apply the operation at `i=4`:
   - `a_3 = a_3 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`
   - `a_4 = a_4 - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3`
   - `a_5 = a_5 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`
   Resulting array: `[1, 3, 3, 3, 1]`
2. Apply the operation at `i=3`:
   - `a_2 = a_2 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`
   - `a_3 = a_3 - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1`
   - `a_4 = a_4 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`
   Resulting array: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`
3. Apply the operation at `i=2`:
   - `a_1 = a_1 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`
   - `a_2 = a_2 - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0`
   - `a_3 = a_3 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`
   Resulting array: `[0, 0, 0, 2, 1]`
4. Apply the operation at `i=4`:
   - `a_3 = a_3 - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1` (Invalid operation as it results in a negative value)
   
Since the program does not handle the decrement operations correctly and may result in invalid states (like negative values), it fails to correctly determine if all elements can be made zero. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
