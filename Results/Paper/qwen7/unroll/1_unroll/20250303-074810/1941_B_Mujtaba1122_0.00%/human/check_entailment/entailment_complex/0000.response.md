### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds a non-zero element.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - The function does not modify the list or the integer `n`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function attempts to reduce the elements of the list according to the specified operations.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to n-2 (excluding the first and last elements).
   - For each element, if it is greater than 1 and both its adjacent elements are greater than 0, it performs the specified operations:
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - These operations effectively reduce the value of `list[i]` by twice the value of `list[i - 1]`, `list[i - 1]` by itself, and `list[i + 1]` by the value of `list[i - 1]`.
   - The function continues these operations until no further reductions can be made under the given conditions.
   - After performing the operations, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements in the list are zero.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Overall Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   - It then calls `func_2` with the array and its size.
   - The function `func_2` correctly implements the logic to reduce the array elements according to the specified operations and checks if all elements can be reduced to zero.
   - The program correctly outputs 'YES' or 'NO' based on the result of `func_2`.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.
