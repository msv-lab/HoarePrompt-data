### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the provided problem description, function summaries, and the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
- If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`.
- Otherwise, it returns `True`.

This function is straightforward and works correctly.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function attempts to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.
- It iterates through the array from index 1 to `n-2` (inclusive).
- For each index `i`, it checks if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`.
- If these conditions are met, it performs the operation:
  - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
  - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
  - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
- After performing the operations, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero.
- If they are, it prints 'YES'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Operation Effectiveness**:
   - The operation reduces three elements: `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}`.
   - Specifically, it decreases `a_{i-1}` by 1, `a_i` by 2, and `a_{i+1}` by 1.
   - This operation is designed to reduce the value of `a_i` by 2, which is crucial for making the array elements zero.

2. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The algorithm iterates through the array and applies the operation whenever possible.
   - It ensures that the operation can only be applied when the necessary conditions are met (`a_i > 1` and both neighbors are greater than 0).
   - After applying the operation, it checks if all elements are zero.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm handles edge cases where the array might not allow further operations (e.g., if no valid `i` exists).
   - It correctly identifies such cases and prints 'NO'.

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the operation within `func_2`. The operation should be:

```python
list[i-1] -= 1
list[i] -= 2
list[i+1] -= 1
```

Instead of:

```python
list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]
list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]
list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]
```

The current implementation incorrectly modifies `list[i-1]` multiple times, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if `list[i-1]` is 1, it will be reduced to 0, and then the subsequent operations will not behave as intended.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the operation is applied correctly without modifying `list[i-1]` multiple times.

### Corrected Implementation

Here is the corrected version of `func_2`:

```python
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1
            list[i] -= 2
            list[i + 1] -= 1
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

With this correction, the program should work as intended.

### Final Evaluation

Given the corrected implementation, the original assessment was inaccurate due to the incorrect operation implementation in `func_2`.

**Final: False**
