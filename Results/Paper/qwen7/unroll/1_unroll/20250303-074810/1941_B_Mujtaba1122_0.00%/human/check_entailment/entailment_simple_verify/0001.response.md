### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step based on the provided annotated code and the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1`
- **Purpose**: Checks if all elements in the list are zero.
- **Behavior**: Iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero. Otherwise, it returns `True`.
- **Correctness**: This function works correctly and is used appropriately in the main logic.

#### Function `func_2`
- **Purpose**: Attempts to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.
- **Behavior**:
  - Iterates through the array from index 1 to `n-2` (inclusive).
  - For each index `i`, it checks if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`.
  - If these conditions are met, it performs the operation:
    - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
    - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
    - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
  - After performing the operations, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero.
  - If they are, it prints 'YES'.
  - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Operation Effectiveness**:
   - The operation reduces three elements: `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}`.
   - Specifically, it decreases `a_{i-1}` by 1, `a_i` by 2, and `a_{i+1}` by 1.
   - This operation is designed to reduce the value of `a_i` by 2, which is crucial for making the array elements zero.

2. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The algorithm iterates through the array and applies the operation whenever possible.
   - It ensures that the operation can only be applied when the necessary conditions are met (`a_i > 1` and both neighbors are greater than 0).
   - After applying the operation, it checks if all elements are zero.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm handles edge cases where the array might not allow further operations (e.g., if no valid `i` exists).
   - It correctly identifies such cases and prints 'NO'.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the operations are applied correctly and the final check with `func_1` ensures the result is accurate.
   - The logic is sound and the operations are performed as intended.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to achieve this goal.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
