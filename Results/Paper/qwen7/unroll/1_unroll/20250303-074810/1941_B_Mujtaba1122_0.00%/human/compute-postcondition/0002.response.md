Output State: The list will be transformed such that for every element at index `i` (where 1 < i < n-1), if `list[i]` was greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` were greater than 0, then `list[i]` will be reduced by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i-1]` will be reduced by itself, and `list[i+1]` will be reduced by the value of `list[i-1]`. This process continues until the condition `list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0` is no longer satisfied for any `i`. The elements at the boundaries (`list[0]` and `list[n-1]`) remain unchanged throughout the process.
