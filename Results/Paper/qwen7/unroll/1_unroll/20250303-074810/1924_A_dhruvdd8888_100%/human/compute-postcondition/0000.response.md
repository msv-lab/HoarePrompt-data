Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and the values of n, k, and m are set to the integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation. The values of `n`, `k`, and `m` are now specific to the integers entered by the user, but their ranges remain the same.
