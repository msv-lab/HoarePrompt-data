Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \), and the string \( s \).
3. It uses a set `us` to store the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets.
4. It initializes an empty set `win` to keep track of the characters encountered in the string \( s \) that are part of the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets.
5. It iterates through the string \( s \), adding characters to `win` when they are in `us`.
6. If `win` contains all \( k \) characters, it appends these characters to `ans` and clears `win`.
7. After processing the string \( s \), it checks if the number of distinct characters in `ans` is at least \( n \).
8. If so, it prints 'YES'.
9. If not, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string that includes the missing character from the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets.

Given the logic and the steps outlined in the execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
