Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads two integers `a` and `b` for each test case, representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Case 1: Both Dimensions Even**:
   - If both `a` and `b` are even, the program prints 'yes'.
   - This is correct because if both dimensions are even, you can always cut the rectangle into smaller even-sized rectangles and reassemble them into a different rectangle. For example, a \(4 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut into \(2 \times 6\) and \(2 \times 6\) and reassembled into a \(6 \times 4\) rectangle.

3. **Case 2: One Dimension is Exactly Double the Other**:
   - The condition `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is incorrect. The correct condition should check if one dimension is exactly double the other.
   - The correct condition should be `abs(a - b) == min(a, b)`. If this condition holds, the program should print 'no' because the only way to cut such a rectangle would result in two rectangles that cannot form a different rectangle when reassembled.
   - The current condition is incorrect and will not work as intended.

4. **Case 3: Difference Between Dimensions is Odd**:
   - The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is redundant and incorrect.
   - The correct logic should be to check if the difference between the dimensions is odd. If the difference is odd, the program should print 'yes' because the resulting smaller rectangles after cutting will have an odd difference, allowing for the formation of a different rectangle.
   - The current condition is incorrect and will not work as intended.

5. **Default Case**:
   - The default case prints 'no', which is correct for all other cases where none of the above conditions hold.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif abs(a - b) == min(a, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 != 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program contains logical errors in handling the conditions. After correcting these errors, the program should work as expected.

**Correctness: False**
