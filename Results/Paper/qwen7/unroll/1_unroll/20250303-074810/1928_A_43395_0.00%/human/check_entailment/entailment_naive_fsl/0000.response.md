Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the conditions for determining whether Bob can obtain another rectangle are incomplete and incorrect.

1. The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` checks if both dimensions are even. If this is true, it prints 'yes', but this is not always correct. For example, a 2x2 rectangle can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, and then rearranged to form a 2x2 rectangle again, which is not a new rectangle.

2. The condition `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` seems to be checking if the difference between the dimensions is equal to one of the dimensions, but this is also not sufficient. For instance, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles and rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is a valid case that should return 'yes'.

3. The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is redundant and incorrect. It checks if the difference between the dimensions is odd, but this does not cover all valid cases where a new rectangle can be formed.

A more accurate approach would be to check if either dimension is 1, or if the dimensions can be split such that the resulting pieces can form a new rectangle. For example, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles and rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which should return 'yes'. However, the current implementation does not cover these scenarios correctly.
