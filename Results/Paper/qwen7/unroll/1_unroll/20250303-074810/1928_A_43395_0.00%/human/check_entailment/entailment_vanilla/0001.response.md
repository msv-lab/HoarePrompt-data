Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Reading Dimensions**:
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
   - This part is also correct and matches the problem description.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks several conditions to determine if a new rectangle can be formed:
     - **Condition 1**: `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`
       - If both `a` and `b` are even, the program prints 'yes'.
       - This condition is correct because if both dimensions are even, you can always cut them into smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
     - **Condition 2**: `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`
       - This condition is incorrect. It should be checking if either `a == b` (which would mean the rectangle is already a square and cannot be cut into two non-trivial rectangles).
       - The current condition is not valid and does not make sense in the context of the problem.
     - **Condition 3**: `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`
       - This condition is redundant and incorrect. It checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, but it doesn't provide a clear logic for determining if a new rectangle can be formed.
     - **Else**: `print('no')`
       - This covers all other cases, but due to the incorrect conditions above, it might not handle all edge cases correctly.

### Correct Conditions:
- A rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and rearranged to form a new rectangle if at least one of the following conditions is met:
  - Both dimensions are even.
  - One dimension is exactly twice the other (i.e., `a == 2 * b` or `b == 2 * a`).

### Revised Program:
Here is a revised version of the program that correctly implements the logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('no')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif a == 2 * b or b == 2 * a:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')

func()
```

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the original program contains logical errors and does not correctly implement the required logic. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
