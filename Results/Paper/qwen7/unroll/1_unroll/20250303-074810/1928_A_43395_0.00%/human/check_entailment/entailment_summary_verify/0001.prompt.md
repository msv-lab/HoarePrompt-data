You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it checks specific conditions involving \(a\) and \(b\). If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, it prints 'yes'. If the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) equals \(-a\) or \(-b\), it prints 'no'. If the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd, it prints 'yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Reading Dimensions**:
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
   - This part is also correct and matches the problem description.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks several conditions to determine if a new rectangle can be formed:
     - **Condition 1**: `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`
       - If both `a` and `b` are even, the program prints 'yes'.
       - This condition is correct because if both dimensions are even, you can always cut them into smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
     - **Condition 2**: `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`
       - This condition is incorrect. It should be checking if either `a == b` (which would mean the rectangle is already a square and cannot be cut into two non-trivial rectangles).
       - The current condition is not valid and does not make sense in the context of the problem.
     - **Condition 3**: `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`
       - This condition is redundant and incorrect. It checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, but it doesn't provide a clear logic for determining if a new rectangle can be formed.
     - **Else**: `print('no')`
       - This covers all other cases, but due to the incorrect conditions above, it might not handle all edge cases correctly.

### Correct Conditions:
- A rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and rearranged to form a new rectangle if at least one of the following conditions is met:
  - Both dimensions are even.
  - One dimension is exactly twice the other (i.e., `a == 2 * b` or `b == 2 * a`).

### Revised Program:
Here is a revised version of the program that correctly implements the logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('no')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif a == 2 * b or b == 2 * a:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')

func()
```

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the original program contains logical errors and does not correctly implement the required logic. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
