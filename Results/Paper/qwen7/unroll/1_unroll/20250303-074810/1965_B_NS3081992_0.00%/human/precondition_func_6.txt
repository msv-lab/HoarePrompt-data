None of the variables `n` and `k` are mentioned in the provided function signature. However, based on the problem description, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Additionally, the function `func_7()` is expected to read input and split it into a list of integers, but it does not take any arguments.
