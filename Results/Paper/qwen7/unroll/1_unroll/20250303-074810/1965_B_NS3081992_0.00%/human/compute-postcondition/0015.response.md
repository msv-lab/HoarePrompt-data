Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `lk - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the loop.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < lk - 1`. This means that `i` should be less than `lk - 1` for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Initial values of relevant variables**:
   - `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
   - `k` is the second return value of `func_7()`.
   - `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
   - `l` is the length of `b`.
   - `lk` is the length of `bk`.
   - `ans` is an empty list.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `lk - 1` for the loop to execute at least once.
   - We don't need to adjust `b`, `k`, `bk`, `l`, or `lk` because they are not used directly in the loop condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` being less than `lk - 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `lk` must be greater than 1**
