You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no variable passed to the function `func_15`, and it is assumed that `func_10` and `func_14` are defined elsewhere in the program. The function `func_10` returns an integer representing the number of test cases, and `func_14` is expected to return an integer representing the size of the sequence for each test case.
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers, each on a new line, where the number of integers is equal to the return value of `func_10()`. Each integer represents the result of `func_14()` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns the number of test cases as an integer, which is obtained from the function func_10. It then returns the size of the sequence for each test case as an integer, which is obtained from the function func_14.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
