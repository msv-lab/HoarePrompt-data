Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i` being set to `lk`.
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `l`.

3. **Initial Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = lk`, `i` must be initialized to `lk` for the loop to begin.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < l`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than `l` for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` is initialized to `lk` and that `i < l` for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state where `ans` is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 13, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`, this list is not directly relevant to the loop's execution. The only state that needs adjustment is related to the loop variable `i`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `lk` and `i` must be less than `l`**
