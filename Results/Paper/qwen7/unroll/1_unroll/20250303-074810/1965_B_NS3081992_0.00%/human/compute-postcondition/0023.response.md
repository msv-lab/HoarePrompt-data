Output State: **The program returns a space-separated string of numbers starting from 2, 3, followed by powers of 2 from 2^2 to 2^(length of b - 2), and ends with k + 1 and 2 * k + 1 if k is 1, otherwise it includes 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2**

Explanation: The code `return ' '.join(map(str, ans))` converts each element in the list `ans` to a string and joins them with a space. Given the initial state, `ans` contains the initial values `[2, 3]` plus additional powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{(l-2)}\). If `k` is 1, it also includes `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1`. Otherwise, it includes `[1, 2, 4, 8, 13, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2]`.
