Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the provided function contribute to solving the problem directly. The function `func_5()` reads a line from standard input, strips the trailing newline character, and returns it.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of zeros and ones with the same length as the maximum key in `d.keys() + 1`, an integer `da` which is a key from the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` of zeros with the same length as the maximum key in `d.keys()`. It updates the `processing` list to mark nodes as processed and recursively calculates the minimum value of `func_12` for each node in `d[da]` where `processing` is not yet set. If the length of `d[da]` is 1, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it updates the `rank` list with `tmp + 1` and returns this value.

    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns y, x - a // b * y, g
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, where `b` is not zero. If `b` is zero, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with updated values until `b` becomes zero, then returns a tuple `(y, x - a // b * y, g)` where `x` and `y` are computed based on the Euclidean algorithm, and `g` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no explicit parameters but relies on the values returned by `func_7()` which are `n` and `k`. It then processes these values to generate a list of numbers based on certain conditions. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` containing specific numbers including powers of 2 and some derived values from `k`. Finally, it returns a space-separated string of these numbers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` outputs a series of integers, each representing the size of a sequence for a specific test case. The number of integers outputted is determined by the return value of `func_10`, which indicates the number of test cases. After executing, the function does not return any value but prints the sequence sizes for all test cases to the standard output.
