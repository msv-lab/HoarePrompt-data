Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly solve the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input using functions like `func_7()` and `func_10()` which read integers and lines from standard input.

2. **Problem Solving Logic**:
   - For the special case when `k == 1`, it generates a sequence `[2, 3, 2^i for i in range(2, l)]` where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - For other values of `k`, it constructs a sequence that ensures no subsequence sums to `k` while ensuring all other sums from `1` to `n` can be formed.
     - It uses the binary representation of `n` and `k` to construct the sequence.
     - It includes powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n` and adjusts the sequence to ensure no subsequence sums to `k`.

3. **Output Generation**: The constructed sequence is printed in the required format.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the provided solution seems to meet the requirements correctly.
