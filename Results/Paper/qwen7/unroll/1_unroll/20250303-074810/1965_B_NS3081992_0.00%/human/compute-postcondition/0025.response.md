Functionality: **The function takes no explicit parameters but relies on the values returned by `func_7()` which are `n` and `k`. It then processes these values to generate a list of numbers based on certain conditions. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` containing specific numbers including powers of 2 and some derived values from `k`. Finally, it returns a space-separated string of these numbers.**
