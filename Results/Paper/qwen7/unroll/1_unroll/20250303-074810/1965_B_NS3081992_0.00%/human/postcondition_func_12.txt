The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, where `b` is not zero. If `b` is zero, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with updated values until `b` becomes zero, then returns a tuple `(y, x - a // b * y, g)` where `x` and `y` are computed based on the Euclidean algorithm, and `g` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.
