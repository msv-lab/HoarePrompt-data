Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is equal to the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`.**

Explanation: The code `t, = R()` unpacks the tuple returned by the lambda function `R()`, which splits the input and maps each element to an integer. Since `t` is unpacked from the tuple, `t` will be equal to the first element of that tuple. The initial condition that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` remains valid.
