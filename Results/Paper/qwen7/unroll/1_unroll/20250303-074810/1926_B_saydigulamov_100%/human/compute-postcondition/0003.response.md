Output State: The output state depends on the inputs provided during the execution of the loop. For each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `a`), the program checks a series of strings (`b`) for the presence of '1's and counts them. If the counts of '1's in the first two strings are equal, it prints 'SQUARE'; otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. The final output state will consist of `a` lines, each containing either 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' based on the comparison of '1' counts in the first two strings for each set of inputs.
