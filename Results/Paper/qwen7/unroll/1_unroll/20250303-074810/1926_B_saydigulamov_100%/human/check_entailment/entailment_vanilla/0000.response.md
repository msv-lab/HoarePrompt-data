### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes an empty list `k` to store the count of `1`s in each row.
   - It iterates through each row of the grid, counts the number of `1`s in each row, and appends this count to the list `k`.

3. **Determining the Shape:**
   - The program checks if the first two counts in the list `k` are equal (`k[0] == k[1]`).
   - If they are equal, it prints "SQUARE".
   - Otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Triangle Detection:**
  - A triangle or an upside-down triangle will have rows with increasing numbers of `1`s until the middle row, then decreasing numbers of `1`s.
  - For example, for a triangle with `k=4`, the counts of `1`s would be `[1, 3, 5, 3, 1]`.
  - The program only checks the first two counts and does not check the entire sequence, which means it cannot correctly identify a triangle.

- **Square Detection:**
  - A square will have the same number of `1`s in each row.
  - For example, for a square with `k=4`, the counts of `1`s would be `[4, 4, 4, 4]`.
  - The program correctly checks if the first two counts are equal, which is sufficient to determine a square since all counts should be equal.

### Conclusion:

The program incorrectly identifies triangles because it only checks the first two counts and does not verify the entire pattern. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
