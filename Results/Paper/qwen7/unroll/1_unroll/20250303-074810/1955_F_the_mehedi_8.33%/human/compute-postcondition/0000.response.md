Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_` (a dummy variable used in the `for` loop)
   - The result of `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. This value should be a positive integer, as indicated by the condition `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on the input value, the state before the loop must include the condition that the input value is within the specified range. The other variables (`p_i`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that the input value is a positive integer within the specified range.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
