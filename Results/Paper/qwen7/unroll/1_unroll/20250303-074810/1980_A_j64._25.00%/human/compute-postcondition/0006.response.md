Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list of integers named 'results', where each integer represents the number of missing elements required to make the frequency of each character in the string 'a' at least 'm'. The length of this list is equal to the value of 't'.**
