Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the function `func_1` which takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`.
2. For each test case, it initializes a frequency array `freq` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the input string `a`.
3. It then calculates how many additional problems are needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of having at least `m` problems for each difficulty level.
4. The sum of these additional problems gives the total number of problems Vlad needs to create for that test case.
5. The function returns a list of results, where each element corresponds to the number of additional problems needed for each test case.
6. The provided example test cases match the expected output, indicating that the logic is correct.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
