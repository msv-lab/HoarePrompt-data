### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - **First Test Case**: \( (10, 1, 'BGECDCBDED') \)
     - The bank has 10 problems with difficulties 'B', 'G', 'E', 'C', 'D', 'B', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'E'.
     - Since only one round is needed, we need at least one problem of each difficulty level.
     - The program correctly identifies that two additional problems ('A' and 'F') are needed, resulting in a total of 2.
   - **Second Test Case**: \( (10, 2, 'BGECDCBDED') \)
     - The bank has 10 problems with difficulties 'B', 'G', 'E', 'C', 'D', 'B', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'E'.
     - Two rounds are needed, so we need at least two problems of each difficulty level.
     - The program correctly identifies that five additional problems ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E') are needed, resulting in a total of 5.
   - **Third Test Case**: \( (9, 1, 'BBCDEFFGG') \)
     - The bank has 9 problems with difficulties 'B', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'G'.
     - Only one round is needed, so we need at least one problem of each difficulty level.
     - The program correctly identifies that one additional problem ('A') is needed, resulting in a total of 1.

2. **General Case Analysis**:
   - The program uses a frequency array to count the occurrences of each difficulty level.
   - It then calculates the number of missing problems required for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds.
   - The logic ensures that the program handles all potential cases correctly, including edge cases like having fewer than `m` problems of a certain difficulty level.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency array to count the occurrences of each difficulty level.
   - It then calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level using the formula `max(0, m - f)` where `f` is the frequency of the current difficulty level.
   - Finally, it sums up the missing problems for all difficulty levels and appends the result to the `results` list.

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations provided in the annotated code align with the program's logic and confirm that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems needed for each test case.

Given the detailed analysis and the alignment with the provided test cases and annotations, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
