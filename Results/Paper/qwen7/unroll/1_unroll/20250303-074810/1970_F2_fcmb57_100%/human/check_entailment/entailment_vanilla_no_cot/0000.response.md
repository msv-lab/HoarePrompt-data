Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
1. **Function `func_1` Usage**: The function `func_1` is defined correctly, but it is never called in the main logic of the program. Instead, the movements are directly applied using dictionary `mouvements`. This means the function `func_1` is redundant and should be removed or used appropriately.

2. **Handling Bludgers and Player Eliminations**: The logic for handling bludgers and player eliminations is incorrect. Specifically, the line `elimines = []` inside the loop should be outside the loop and should be initialized before the loop starts. Also, the check for whether a player is eliminated should be done properly.

3. **Quaffle Handling**: The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to correctly assign the player who caught the Quaffle.

4. **Final Score Output**: The final score should be printed after all moves have been processed, but the current implementation prints the final score immediately after processing all moves, which is correct.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[0] == '.Q':
        quidditch[0] = (quidditch[0][0] + mouvements[mo[1]][0], quidditch[0][1] + mouvements[mo[1]][1])
    elif mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = (players[mo[0]][0] + mouvements[mo[1]][0], players[mo[0]][1] + mouvements[mo[1]][1])
        if '.B' in players:
            elimines = []
            for (k, v) in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    elimines.append(k)
            elimines.sort()
            for c in elimines:
                print(i, c, 'ELIMINATED')
                if quidditch[1] == c:
                    quidditch = [players[c], '']
                del players[c]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        quidditch[1] = ''
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            if mo[0][0] == 'R':
                quidditch[0] = middle
            else:
                quidditch[0] = players[mo[0]]
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            if mo[0][0] == 'B':
                quidditch[0] = middle
            else:
                quidditch[0] = players[mo[0]]

print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

With these corrections, the program should work as expected.
