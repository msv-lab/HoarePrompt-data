Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input to initialize the field, players, goals, and the initial position of the Quaffle and Bludger.
2. **Movement Logic**: The program handles the movement of players and the Quaffle correctly. It updates the positions of players and the Quaffle based on the input actions.
3. **Elimination Logic**: When a player is eliminated, the program correctly identifies and prints the elimination event. The sorting of player names ensures that the events are printed in the correct order.
4. **Scoring Logic**: The program correctly updates the scores when a player scores a goal. It also correctly handles the movement of the Quaffle to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.
5. **Final Score Output**: The program outputs the final score at the end of the game, which is correct based on the accumulated points.

Given the provided annotated program and the problem description, the program logic appears to be correct and aligns with the requirements specified.

Correctness: **True**
