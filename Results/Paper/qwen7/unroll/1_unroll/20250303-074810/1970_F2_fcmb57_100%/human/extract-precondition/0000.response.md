Precondition: **a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field, respectively, where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of strings, each string containing M characters. The list has N strings. Each character in the strings can be one of the following: '.', 'R0' to 'R9', 'B0' to 'B9', 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B'. The integers P, T, and the sequence of actions are also provided, where 1 ≤ P ≤ 10 and 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000.**
