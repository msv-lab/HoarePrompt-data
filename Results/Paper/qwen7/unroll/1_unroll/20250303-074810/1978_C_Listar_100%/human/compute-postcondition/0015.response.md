Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers `n` and `k` provided as space-separated values on a single line. If both `n` and `k` are out of their specified ranges, it returns (0, 0). Otherwise, it returns `n` and `k`, where `max_k` is the maximum value between `n` (if `n` is odd) and `k` (if `n` is even), and `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
