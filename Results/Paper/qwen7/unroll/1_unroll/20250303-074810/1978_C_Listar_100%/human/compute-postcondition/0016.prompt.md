You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, k) are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5}, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}, and n and k are provided as space-separated values on a single line for each test case.
def func_4():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (k % 2) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two zeros (0, 0)
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5}; `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}; `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers. The value of `k` is even
    if (n % 2) :
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else :
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5}; `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}; `max_k` is the maximum value between `n` and `n` if `n` is odd, and `k` if `n` is even.
    if (max_k < k) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two values both as 0.
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5}; `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}; `max_k` is the maximum value between `n` and `n` if `n` is odd, and `k` if `n` is even. **max_k is greater than or equal to k**
    return n, k
    #The program returns the values of `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12. The value of `max_k` is the maximum value between `n` (if `n` is odd) and `k` (if `n` is even), and `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers `n` and `k` provided as space-separated values on a single line. If both `n` and `k` are out of their specified ranges, it returns (0, 0). Otherwise, it returns `n` and `k`, where `max_k` is the maximum value between `n` (if `n` is odd) and `k` (if `n` is even), and `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns two zeros (0, 0)

Case_2: The program returns two values both as 0.

Case_3: The program returns the values of `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12. The value of `max_k` is the maximum value between `n` (if `n` is odd) and `k` (if `n` is even), and `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
