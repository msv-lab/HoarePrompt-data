Output State: **`l` is the return value of `func_1(n, k)`, and `l` is passed as an argument to `func_5(l)`**.

Explanation: The code `func_5(l)` calls the function `func_5` with the argument `l`, which is the return value of `func_1(n, k)`. The initial conditions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and no new variables are introduced or modified. Therefore, the only change is that `l` is now being used as an argument in the function call `func_5(l)`.
