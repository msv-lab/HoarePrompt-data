Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_4`**: This function checks if `k` is odd and if so, immediately returns `(0, 0)`. It then calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for a given `n` and compares it with `k`. If `max_k` is less than `k`, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation exists. Otherwise, it returns `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function is designed to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value. It halves `k`, iterates through the list `l` from `n` down to 1, and modifies `l` based on the value of `k`. If `k` becomes 0, it returns the constructed list. Otherwise, it calls `func_2` or `func_3` to adjust the list further.

3. **Function `func_2` and `func_3`**: These functions perform specific swaps in the list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value. `func_2` swaps elements at positions `-c` and `-c - k`, while `func_3` swaps elements at positions `c - 1` and `-c`.

4. **Function `func_5`**: This function prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` if `l` is a valid permutation with the desired Manhattan value. If `l` is not valid, it does not execute this function.

5. **Function `func_6`**: This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to get `n` and `k`, then constructs the permutation using `func_1` and prints the result using `func_5`.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the program correctly handles the constraints and requirements:
- It checks if a valid permutation exists based on `n` and `k`.
- It constructs a permutation with the desired Manhattan value if possible.
- It handles edge cases where no valid permutation exists.

Therefore, the program meets the problem requirements and is correct.

Correctness: **True**
