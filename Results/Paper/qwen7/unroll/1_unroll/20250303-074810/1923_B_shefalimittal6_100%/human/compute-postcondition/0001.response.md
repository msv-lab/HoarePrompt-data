Output State: **`sorted_indices` is a list of indices from `range(n)` sorted based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`; `n` is the length of the list `a`, `a` is a list of non-negative integers representing the health of the monsters, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, and `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of bullets you can fire per second.**

This means that `sorted_indices` now contains the indices of the list `x` sorted in ascending order based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`. The values of `n`, `a`, `x`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
