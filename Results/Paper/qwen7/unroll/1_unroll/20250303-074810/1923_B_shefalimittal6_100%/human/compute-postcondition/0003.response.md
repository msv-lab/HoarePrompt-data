Output State: **`distance` is 0, `pos` is 0**

Explanation: The initial state has `distance` set to 0 and `pos` also set to 0. The given code snippet only introduces a new variable `pos` and sets it to 0. Since no operations are performed on `distance`, its value remains unchanged. Therefore, both `distance` and `pos` are 0 after the code execution.
