Output State: **`res` is a boolean value which is True if `el[0]` is either 'B' or 'R' and `el[1]` is not 'G', otherwise False.**

This means that `res` is calculated based on whether the first character of `el` is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G'. The initial values of `el` remain unchanged, and `res` is set to True or False accordingly.
