N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd. The field is represented as a list of N strings, each string contains M characters. The field contains between 1 and 5 RG and BG goals, players represented as R0-R9 and B0-B9, and exactly one .Q for the Quaffle. T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000. Each action in the game is described as a string containing a valid entity (player or ball) and a valid action (U, D, L, R, C, T) with appropriate parameters.
