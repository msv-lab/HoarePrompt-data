The function `isPlayer` accepts a parameter `el`, which is a string. The string `el` represents an entity on the field, where the first character indicates the team (either 'R' for Red or 'B' for Blue) and the second character can be a player number (0-9) or 'G' for a goal. The function returns a boolean value `res`, which is True if the first character of `el` is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G', otherwise it returns False.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `el`, and returns `True` if the first character of `el` is 'R' or 'B' and the second character is not 'G'. Otherwise, it returns `False`.**
