Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, and the range is defined by `n`. Therefore, the only variables that need to be considered are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the range function in Python starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`. This means if `n` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is set to 0 (the starting value for the range function).

Given the initial states:
- `n` is an integer equal to the first number from the input.
- `m` is an integer equal to the second number from the input.
- `grid` is an empty list.
- `elements` is a dictionary containing {'.B': (-1, -1)}.
- `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary.
- `goal` is a list containing two empty lists.
- `points` is [0, 0].

We only need to adjust the states of `n` and `i`.

Therefore, the modified state should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
