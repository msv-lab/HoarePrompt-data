Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The logic in the program is based on counting the number of positions where a digit is greater than the next digit in the string and adding one to that count. However, this approach does not account for the requirement to rearrange the pieces into a sorted binary string. Instead, the solution should focus on identifying the points where the string transitions from '0' to '1', as these points will determine the minimum number of cuts required.

Here's a breakdown of why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program counts the number of positions where a digit is greater than the next digit, which is not relevant to the problem. This logic would work for finding local maxima in a sequence of numbers but does not help in determining the minimum number of cuts needed to sort the binary string.

2. **Requirement Misunderstanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of pieces such that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string. This means we need to identify the points where the string changes from '0' to '1' because each segment between these points can be treated as a separate piece.

3. **Correct Approach**: To solve the problem correctly, we should iterate through the string and count the number of transitions from '0' to '1'. Each transition indicates a potential cut point, and the total number of such points plus one gives the minimum number of pieces needed.

Given these observations, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
