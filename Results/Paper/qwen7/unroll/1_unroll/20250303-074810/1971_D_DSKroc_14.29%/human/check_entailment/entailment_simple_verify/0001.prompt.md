You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        print(count + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        
        print(count + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and for each input string `s`, the output is the number of times a digit is greater than the next digit in `s` plus one.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

2. **Counting Violations**:
   - The program iterates through the string `s` and checks if the current character is greater than the next character.
   - If `int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1])`, it means there is a violation of the sorted order (i.e., a '1' comes before a '0').
   - Each violation is counted.

3. **Calculating Pieces**:
   - The program prints `count + 1` as the result.
   - This logic assumes that each violation requires a new piece, plus an additional piece for the remaining part of the string.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the example test cases provided:

1. **Test Case: "11010"**
   - Violations: 
     - Between '1' and '0': `1 > 0` → Violation
     - Between '0' and '1': `0 < 1` → No violation
     - Between '1' and '0': `1 > 0` → Violation
   - Count of violations: 2
   - Expected output: `2 + 1 = 3`
   - Actual output: 3

2. **Test Case: "00000000"**
   - No violations since the string is already sorted.
   - Count of violations: 0
   - Expected output: `0 + 1 = 1`
   - Actual output: 1

3. **Test Case: "1"**
   - No violations since the string is already sorted.
   - Count of violations: 0
   - Expected output: `0 + 1 = 1`
   - Actual output: 1

4. **Test Case: "10"**
   - Violation: `1 > 0` → Violation
   - Count of violations: 1
   - Expected output: `1 + 1 = 2`
   - Actual output: 2

5. **Test Case: "0001111"**
   - No violations since the string is already sorted.
   - Count of violations: 0
   - Expected output: `0 + 1 = 1`
   - Actual output: 1

6. **Test Case: "0110"**
   - Violations:
     - Between '0' and '1': `0 < 1` → No violation
     - Between '1' and '1': `1 < 1` → No violation
     - Between '1' and '0': `1 > 0` → Violation
   - Count of violations: 1
   - Expected output: `1 + 1 = 2`
   - Actual output: 2

### Conclusion

The program correctly counts the number of violations and adds one to determine the minimum number of pieces required. This approach works for the given examples and follows the problem constraints.
