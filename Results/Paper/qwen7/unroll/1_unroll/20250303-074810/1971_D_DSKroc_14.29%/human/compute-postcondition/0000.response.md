Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and it is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, after executing the code, `t` will hold the value of the integer input provided by the user, which must still lie within the range 1 to 500. All other variables remain unchanged, specifically, `s` is not yet defined and thus its state remains as per the initial condition.
