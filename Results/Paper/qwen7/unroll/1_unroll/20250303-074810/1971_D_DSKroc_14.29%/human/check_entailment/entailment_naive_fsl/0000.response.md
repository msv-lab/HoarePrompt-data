Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to count the number of positions where the current character is greater than the next character, which is not the correct approach for solving the problem. The program fails to handle cases where the string can be split into multiple pieces to form a sorted binary string.

For example, consider the input string `0101`. The program would incorrectly output `1` because it counts the position where `1` is followed by `0`, but the correct answer should be `2` because the string can be split into `"01"` and `"01"`.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to count the number of transitions from `0` to `1` and add `1` to it. This will give us the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.
