Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum frequency of any number in the array after adding a permutation to it.
2. The provided code snippet does not match the problem's requirements. It seems to be attempting to solve a different problem, possibly related to counting unique elements in a sorted list.
3. The code initializes `m` as the maximum value in the array, then creates a new list `new` where each element is calculated as `m - arr[i] + 1`. This transformation does not align with the problem's requirement to add a permutation to the array.
4. The code then sorts the new list and uses a set to count unique elements, printing the size of the set. This approach does not solve the problem of finding the maximum frequency of any number in the array after adding a permutation.

Given the mismatch between the provided code and the problem statement, the given program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
