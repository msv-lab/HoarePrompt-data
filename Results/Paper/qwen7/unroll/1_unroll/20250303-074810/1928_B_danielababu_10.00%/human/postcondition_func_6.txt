The function processes an input consisting of multiple space-separated integers and returns a list of these integers converted to strings, sorted in alphabetical order. The function does not use the parameters `t` and `n` as described in the annotation; instead, it directly reads a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts them to strings, and sorts them.
