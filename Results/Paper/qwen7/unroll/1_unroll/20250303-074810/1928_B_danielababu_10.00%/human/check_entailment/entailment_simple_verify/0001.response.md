### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given annotated code step-by-step to understand its behavior and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1()`: Reads an integer `t` which is the number of test cases.
   - `func_3()`: Reads `n` integers for each test case and stores them in the list `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `m = max(arr)`: Finds the maximum value in the array `arr`.
   - `new = []`: Initializes an empty list `new`.
   - `for i in range(n): new.append(m - arr[i] + 1)`: For each element in `arr`, calculates `m - arr[i] + 1` and appends it to `new`. This transformation ensures that the elements in `new` are non-negative and represent the distance from the maximum value in `arr`.
   - `new.sort()`: Sorts the list `new`.
   - `ans = set()`: Initializes an empty set `ans`.
   - `for i in new: if i <= n and i > 0: ans.add(i)`: Iterates over the sorted list `new` and adds elements to the set `ans` if they are within the range `[1, n]`.
   - `print(len(ans))`: Prints the size of the set `ans`, which represents the maximum frequency of any number in the array after adding a permutation.

The key insight here is that the transformation `m - arr[i] + 1` ensures that the elements in `new` are non-negative and represent the distance from the maximum value in `arr`. Sorting `new` allows us to group these distances and identify the maximum frequency of any number in the array.

Given this analysis, the annotated code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It transforms the array to ensure that the maximum value becomes zero, then finds the maximum frequency of any number in the transformed array. The final step of printing the size of the set `ans` gives the desired result.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly states that the given program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem. However, upon detailed analysis, the annotated code indeed solves the problem correctly by transforming the array and finding the maximum frequency of any number.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
