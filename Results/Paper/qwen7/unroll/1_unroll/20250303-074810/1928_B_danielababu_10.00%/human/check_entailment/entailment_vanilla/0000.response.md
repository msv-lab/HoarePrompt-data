### Reasoning:

The given program does not actually implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions defined in the program do not address the core requirement of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array.

Here's what the program does:
- `func_1()`: Reads an integer from input.
- `func_2()`: Reads a space-separated list of integers and returns a map object.
- `func_3()`: Converts the output of `func_2()` into a list of integers.
- `func_4()`: Sorts the list of integers returned by `func_3()`.
- `func_5()`: Reads a line of input and maps each word to a string.
- `func_6()`: Reads a line of input and converts it into a list of characters.
- `func_7()`: Reads a line of input, converts it into a list of strings, and sorts it.
- `func_8()`: Computes the prefix product of the input array.
- `func_9()`: Computes the suffix product of the input array.

None of these functions help in solving the problem of finding the maximum frequency of any number in the array after adding a permutation. 

### Conclusion:
The given program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
