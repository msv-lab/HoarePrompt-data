Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string consists entirely of '1's or entirely of '0's correctly. For example, consider the input string "11111". According to the problem description, this string can be rearranged into a sorted binary string with just 1 piece. However, the program will incorrectly count the number of pieces as 5, which is not correct.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the string is already sorted and handle such cases appropriately. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if s == '0' * len(s) or s == '1' * len(s):
            count = 1
        elif flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)
```

This corrected version checks if the string is already sorted and sets `count` to 1 in those cases.
