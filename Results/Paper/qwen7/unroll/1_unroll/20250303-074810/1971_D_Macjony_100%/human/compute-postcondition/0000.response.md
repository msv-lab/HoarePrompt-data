Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), the input must also satisfy this condition. Therefore, after executing the code, `t` is assigned the value of the input integer, which is within the specified range.
