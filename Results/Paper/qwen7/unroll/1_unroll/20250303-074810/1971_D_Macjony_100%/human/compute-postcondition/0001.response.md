State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500, `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains two variables: `i` and `t`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a valid integer within the specified range (1 to 500).
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
4. Therefore, the state before the loop must ensure that `t` is within the required range and `i` is set to 0.

Thus, the adjusted state is: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500, `i` must be 0**.
