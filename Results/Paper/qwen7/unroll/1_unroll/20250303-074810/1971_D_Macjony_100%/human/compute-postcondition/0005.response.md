Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each string `s`, it counts the number of consecutive character pairs where a '0' is immediately followed by a '1'. If such a pair exists, the count is decremented by 1. Finally, it prints the adjusted count for each string `s`.**
