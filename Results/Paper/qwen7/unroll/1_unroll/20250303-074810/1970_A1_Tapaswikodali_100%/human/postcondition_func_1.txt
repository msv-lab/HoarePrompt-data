The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")", calculates the balance of parentheses, sorts the characters based on their balance and original position, and prints a new string formed by these characters in the sorted order. The final state of the program includes the original string `s`, its length `n`, the final balance `balance`, and a printed string `result` which is a concatenation of characters from `s` sorted by their balance and position.
