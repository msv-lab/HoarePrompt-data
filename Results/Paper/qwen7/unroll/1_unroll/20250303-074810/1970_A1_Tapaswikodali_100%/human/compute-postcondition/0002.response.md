Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance` is 0; `balance_info` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `balance` to 0. The lengths of the string `s` and the list `balance_info` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `balance` and retains the initial states of `s`, `n`, and `balance_info`.
