You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates a value \( ans \) based on \( n \) and \( m \) using a specific algorithm involving a loop. The function outputs the calculated value \( ans \) for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Count Initialization:**
   - The variable `count` is initialized to 2.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This suggests that initially, the program considers all pairs where `b = 1`, which is always valid since `a + 1` is always a multiple of `1`.

3. **Loop to Calculate Valid Pairs:**
   - The loop runs from `count = 2` to `m`.
   - For each `count`, it calculates `countmins` as `int(count - 1)`.
   - It then calculates `g` as `int(n / count)`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks, indicating that further values of `count` will not yield any valid pairs.
   - Otherwise, it updates `ans` by adding `int(g / count) + 1`.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Detailed Reasoning

#### Example Analysis

Let's manually verify the logic with the example provided in the problem statement.

- **Test Case 1:** \( n = 1 \), \( m = 1 \)
  - Initial `ans = 1` (since `a = 1` and `b = 1` is valid).
  - Loop runs from `count = 2` to `1` (breaks immediately).
  - Output: `1` (correct).

- **Test Case 2:** \( n = 2 \), \( m = 3 \)
  - Initial `ans = 2` (pairs: (1,1), (2,1)).
  - Loop runs from `count = 2` to `3`.
    - For `count = 2`: `countmins = 1`, `g = 1` (valid pair: (2,2)).
    - For `count = 3`: `countmins = 2`, `g = 0` (no valid pairs).
  - Output: `3` (correct).

- **Test Case 3:** \( n = 3 \), \( m = 5 \)
  - Initial `ans = 3` (pairs: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)).
  - Loop runs from `count = 2` to `5`.
    - For `count = 2`: `countmins = 1`, `g = 1` (valid pair: (2,2)).
    - For `count = 3`: `countmins = 2`, `g = 0` (no valid pairs).
    - For `count = 4`: `countmins = 3`, `g = 0` (no valid pairs).
    - For `count = 5`: `countmins = 4`, `g = 0` (no valid pairs).
  - Output: `4` (correct).

- **Test Case 4:** \( n = 10 \), \( m = 8 \)
  - Initial `ans = 10` (pairs: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1)).
  - Loop runs from `count = 2` to `8`.
    - For `count = 2`: `countmins = 1`, `g = 5` (valid pairs: (2,2), (4,2), (6,2), (8,2), (10,2)).
    - For `count = 3`: `countmins = 2`, `g = 3` (valid pairs: (3,3), (6,3), (9,3)).
    - For `count = 4`: `countmins = 3`, `g = 2` (valid pairs: (4,4), (8,4)).
    - For `count = 5`: `countmins = 4`, `g = 2` (valid pairs: (5,5), (10,5)).
    - For `count = 6`: `countmins = 5`, `g = 1` (valid pair: (6,6)).
    - For `count = 7`: `countmins = 6`, `g = 1` (valid pair: (7,7)).
    - For `count = 8`: `countmins = 7`, `g = 1` (valid pair: (8,8)).
  - Output: `14` (correct).
