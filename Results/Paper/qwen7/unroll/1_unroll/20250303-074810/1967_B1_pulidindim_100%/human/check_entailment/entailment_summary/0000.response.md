Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the algorithm implemented in the `func` function accurately counts the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

1. **Conditions Analysis**:
   - The conditions are: \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function iterates from 2 to \(m\) (inclusive) using a variable `count`.
   - For each `count`, it calculates `g` as `int(n / count)`.
   - If `g` is less than `count - 1`, the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, it adjusts `g` by subtracting `count - 1` and increments the answer `ans` by `int(g / count) + 1`.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The loop starts from 2 and goes up to \(m\). This ensures that all possible values of \(b\) are considered.
   - The calculation of `g` as `int(n / count)` seems to be an attempt to find how many multiples of `count` fit within `n`. However, this approach does not directly address the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The adjustment `g -= count - 1` and the subsequent increment `ans += int(g / count) + 1` do not seem to correctly account for the gcd condition.

4. **Example Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the test case \(n = 10\), \(m = 8\), the expected output is 14.
   - The given implementation does not correctly handle the gcd condition and thus will likely produce incorrect results.

Given the above analysis, the provided implementation does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
