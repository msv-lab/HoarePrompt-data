Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes two positive integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^6, with the sum of `n` or `m` over all test cases not exceeding 2·10^6. The function returns results based on the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.**

Note: The actual return value is not specified in the given information, so the description focuses on the parameters and their constraints.
