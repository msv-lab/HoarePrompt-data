Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Conditions**: The program attempts to count pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the logic inside the `while` loop does not correctly compute this condition.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of GCD and Multiples**: The code tries to incrementally check multiples of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but it does not properly handle the gcd calculation and the condition checking.

3. **Incorrect Increment Logic**: The increment logic for `ans` is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that every multiple of `count` will satisfy the condition without verifying the actual gcd and the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

To solve this problem correctly, you need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges and check the condition directly. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This solution iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly, ensuring correctness.
