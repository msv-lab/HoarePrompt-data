Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates a value \( ans \) based on \( n \) and \( m \) using a specific algorithm involving a loop. The function outputs the calculated value \( ans \) for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
