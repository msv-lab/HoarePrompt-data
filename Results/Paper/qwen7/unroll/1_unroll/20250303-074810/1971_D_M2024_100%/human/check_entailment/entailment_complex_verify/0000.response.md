### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the minimum number of pieces to cut a binary string so that the pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates through the string and counts the number of "01" and "10" transitions.
   - If there are no "01" transitions (`cut0 == 0`), it prints `cut1 + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `cut0 + cut1`.

3. **Key Points from Annotations**:
   - `cut0` counts the number of "01" substrings.
   - `cut1` counts the number of "10" substrings.
   - If there are no "01" substrings, the output is `cut1 + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the output is `cut0 + cut1`.

4. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the test case `111000`:
     - `cut0` (count of "01") = 0
     - `cut1` (count of "10") = 2
     - The program outputs `cut1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.
     - However, the correct answer should be `2` because we can cut after the first '1' and after the last '0' to get two pieces: `111` and `000`, which can be rearranged into `000111`.

5. **Fix Suggestion**:
   - The original assessment suggests counting the number of '1's before the first '0' and the number of '0's after the last '1'.
   - This approach ensures that we correctly identify the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

6. **Revised Program**:
   - We need to count the number of '1's before the first '0' and the number of '0's after the last '1'.
   - The sum of these counts plus one (for the remaining part of the string) will give the minimum number of pieces needed.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string. The suggested fix involves counting the number of '1's before the first '0' and the number of '0's after the last '1'.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
