Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string. Specifically, the program counts the number of transitions from '0' to '1' and from '1' to '0', which is not always the correct approach.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `111000`
- Expected Output: `2` (We can cut after the first '1' and after the last '0' to get two pieces: `111` and `000`, which can be rearranged into `000111`.)

However, the program will output `3` because it counts both transitions from '0' to '1' and from '1' to '0', which is incorrect for this case.

To fix this, we need to count the number of '1's before the first '0' and the number of '0's after the last '1'. The sum of these counts plus one (for the remaining part of the string) will give the minimum number of pieces needed.
