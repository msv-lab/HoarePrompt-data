Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the solution is flawed because it counts transitions between '0' and '1' but does not account for the correct number of pieces needed to sort the binary string.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to count the number of '1's from the start until we encounter the first '1'. This will give us the number of pieces needed because all '0's should come before all '1's. If there are no '1's, then only one piece is needed.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        # Count the number of '1's from the start until the first '1' is encountered
        first_one_index = next((i for i, char in enumerate(a) if char == '1'), None)
        if first_one_index is None:
            # If no '1' is found, the string is already sorted
            print(1)
        else:
            # The number of pieces needed is the index of the first '1'
            print(first_one_index + 1)
```

This solution correctly calculates the minimum number of pieces needed to sort the binary string.
