Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. It counts the occurrences of "01" and "10" substrings within `s`. If there are no "01" substrings, it prints the count of "10" substrings plus one. Otherwise, it prints the sum of the counts of "01" and "10" substrings. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
