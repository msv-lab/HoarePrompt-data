### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes.
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The visibility period of a firework launched at time `x` is from `x` to `x + m`.
   - To maximize the number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.

3. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code calculates `mn = min(a, b) + m`, which is incorrect for determining the LCM.
   - It then checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and prints a formula involving `mn // a` and `mn // b`.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves calculating the LCM of `a` and `b` and then determining how many fireworks can be launched within the visibility period.
   - The formula should be based on the LCM of `a` and `b` and the visibility period `m`.

5. **Issues in the Given Code:**
   - The calculation of `mn` is incorrect.
   - The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1)` is unnecessary and does not correctly handle the LCM.
   - The final print statement uses `mn // a + mn // b`, which is not the correct way to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

6. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\).
   - It calculates `mn` as the minimum of \(a\) and \(b\) plus \(m\).
   - It then checks if `m` is divisible by both \(a\) and \(b\) and prints a formula involving `mn // a` and `mn // b`.

Given the function summary, the code provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function summary suggests that the code is attempting to use a simplified approach that does not account for the actual LCM and the visibility period correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final: False**
