Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. Specifically, the calculation `mn = min(a, b) + m` is incorrect. This value should represent the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` plus `m`, not just the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `6 7 4`
- Expected Output: `2`

However, the program calculates `mn` as `min(6, 7) + 4 = 10`. It then prints `(mn // a + mn // b + 1)`, which results in `(10 // 6 + 10 // 7 + 1) = (1 + 1 + 1) = 3`. This is incorrect because the actual maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is `2`.

The correct approach would be to calculate the LCM of `a` and `b` and then use that value in the calculation. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)
        mn = lcm_ab + m
        print(mn // a + mn // b - 1)
```

This corrected version ensures that the LCM of `a` and `b` is used in the calculation, leading to the correct result.
