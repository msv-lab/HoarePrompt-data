Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t`.
2. **Determine the current state**: Before the loop, `t` is a specific integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive).
3. **Understand the loop execution requirement**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `t` must evaluate to `True`.

Given that `t` is already a non-zero integer (since it is specified to be between 1 and \(10^4\)), the condition `t` is already `True`. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary to make the loop execute the first time.

**Conclusion**: No changes are needed to the state of `t` for the loop to execute the first time.

**Answer**:
State: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)**
