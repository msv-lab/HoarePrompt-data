You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':

- Annotated Code: 
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in the 24-hour format where hh is the hour from 00 to 23 and mm is the minute from 00 to 59.
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        h = s[:2]
        
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each line containing a transformed time string based on the input time string. For each input time "hh:mm", the code converts it to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation and outputs it. If the input hour is '00', it is converted to '12'. Hours from '01' to '12' remain the same. Hours from '13' to '23' are converted by subtracting 12 and prefixing with '0'. The AM/PM indicator is determined by whether the hour is greater than or equal to '12'. Each line will also include either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the converted hour.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined correctly and is expected to handle the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `input()` and converts it to an integer.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `t` times.

3. **Time String Parsing**:
   - For each test case, the time string `s` is read using `input()`.
   - The hour part `h` is extracted using `s[:2]`.

4. **Hour Conversion Logic**:
   - If `h` is `'00'`, it prints `'12'` followed by the minutes part of the time string.
   - If `h` is between `'01'` and `'12'` (inclusive), it directly prints `h` followed by the minutes part.
   - If `h` is greater than `'12'`, it calculates the 12-hour equivalent by subtracting `12` from the hour and prepends `'0'` if necessary, then prints this value followed by the minutes part.

5. **AM/PM Determination**:
   - The program uses `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]` to determine whether to print `'AM'` or `'PM'`. This logic is correct because if `h` is greater than or equal to `'12'`, it should print `'PM'`; otherwise, it should print `'AM'`.

### Verification Against Example

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

- For `09:41`, the hour `09` is less than `12`, so it prints `09:41 AM`.
- For `18:06`, the hour `18` is greater than `12`, so it prints `06:06 PM`.
- For `12:14`, the hour `12` is exactly `12`, so it prints `12:14 PM`.
- For `00:59`, the hour `00` is `'00'`, so it prints `12:59 AM`.
- For `00:00`, the hour `00` is `'00'`, so it prints `12:00 AM`.
- For `14:34`, the hour `14` is greater than `12`, so it prints `02:34 PM`.
- For `01:01`, the hour `01` is less than `12`, so it prints `01:01 AM`.
- For `19:07`, the hour `19` is greater than `12`, so it prints `07:07 PM`.
- For `11:59`, the hour `11` is less than `12`, so it prints `11:59 AM`.
- For `12:00`, the hour `12` is exactly `12`, so it prints `12:00 PM`.
- For `21:37`, the hour `21` is greater than `12`, so it prints `09:37 PM`.

All these outputs match the expected results provided in the example.

### Conclusion

Since the program correctly handles all edge cases and produces the expected output for the given examples, the program is correct.
