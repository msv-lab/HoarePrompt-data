Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined correctly and is expected to handle the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `input()` and converts it to an integer.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `t` times.

3. **Time String Parsing**:
   - For each test case, the time string `s` is read using `input()`.
   - The hour part `h` is extracted using `s[:2]`.

4. **Hour Conversion Logic**:
   - If `h` is `'00'`, it prints `'12'` followed by the minutes part of the time string.
   - If `h` is between `'01'` and `'12'` (inclusive), it directly prints `h` followed by the minutes part.
   - If `h` is greater than `'12'`, it calculates the 12-hour equivalent by subtracting `12` from the hour and prepends `'0'` if necessary, then prints this value followed by the minutes part.

5. **AM/PM Determination**:
   - The program uses `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]` to determine whether to print `'AM'` or `'PM'`. This logic is correct because if `h` is greater than or equal to `'12'`, it should print `'PM'`; otherwise, it should print `'AM'`.

### Verification Against Example

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

- For `09:41`, the hour `09` is less than `12`, so it prints `09:41 AM`.
- For `18:06`, the hour `18` is greater than `12`, so it prints `06:06 PM`.
- For `12:14`, the hour `12` is exactly `12`, so it prints `12:14 PM`.
- For `00:59`, the hour `00` is `'00'`, so it prints `12:59 AM`.
- For `00:00`, the hour `00` is `'00'`, so it prints `12:00 AM`.
- For `14:34`, the hour `14` is greater than `12`, so it prints `02:34 PM`.
- For `01:01`, the hour `01` is less than `12`, so it prints `01:01 AM`.
- For `19:07`, the hour `19` is greater than `12`, so it prints `07:07 PM`.
- For `11:59`, the hour `11` is less than `12`, so it prints `11:59 AM`.
- For `12:00`, the hour `12` is exactly `12`, so it prints `12:00 PM`.
- For `21:37`, the hour `21` is greater than `12`, so it prints `09:37 PM`.

All these outputs match the expected results provided in the example.

### Conclusion

Since the program correctly handles all edge cases and produces the expected output for the given examples, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
