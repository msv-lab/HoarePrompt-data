Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case contains three non-negative integers a, b, and c representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. For each test case, the function determines the feasibility of seating arrangements given the constraints and returns the result accordingly.**
