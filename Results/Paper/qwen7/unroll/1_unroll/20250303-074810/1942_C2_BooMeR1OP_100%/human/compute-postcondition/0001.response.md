Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder) and `t`. The variable `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable when the index itself is not needed within the loop body. The variable `t` is the one that determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is given to be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute if `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the State**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it is greater than 0. This is because the loop will execute based on the value of `t`.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
