Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, the value of `t` is the integer input received, and no other variables have been defined.**

This means that the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input received, while the other variables (like `n`, `x`, `y`, etc.) have not yet been defined or modified. The precondition that `t` is an integer within the specified range remains valid, and now `t` holds the specific integer value entered by the user.
