Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly processes each test case according to the problem statement.
2. It checks if the total points (`total_points`) are even, which is necessary because each game contributes an even number of points (either 2 points to one player and 0 to another, or 1 point to each player).
3. It calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs`) from the total points.
4. It ensures that the total number of matches does not exceed 3 (since there are only 3 players and they can only play against each other in pairs).
5. It checks if the highest score (`p3`) does not exceed the total number of matches.
6. It calculates the number of draws (`egalites // 2`) using the formula derived from the points distribution.
7. If any of these conditions fail, it appends `-1` to the result list, indicating that the scores are inconsistent.
8. The provided examples in the execution summary match the expected behavior of the function.

Given this analysis, the function appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
