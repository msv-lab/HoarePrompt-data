Output State: **`a` is less than `b`, `c` is the result of `func_1(b, a)` with `b` as the first argument and `a` as the second argument, and `d` is the second return value of `func_1(b, a)`.**

Given the initial state where `a` and `b` are positive integers and `a` is less than `b`, the line of code `c, d = func_1(b, a)` calls the function `func_1` with `b` as the first argument and `a` as the second argument. The function returns two values, which are assigned to `c` and `d` respectively. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
