Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The code correctly parses the input, including the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, and the indices of the prefix and suffix maximums.
2. **Edge Cases Handling**: The code checks if the last index of prefix maximums (`p[-1]`) is equal to the first index of suffix maximums (`s[0]`), and if the first index of prefix maximums (`p[0]`) is 1 and the last index of suffix maximums (`s[-1]`) is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, it prints `0` indicating no valid permutations exist. This is correct according to the problem statement.
3. **Combinatorial Calculations**: The code uses combinatorial calculations to determine the number of valid permutations. Specifically, it calculates combinations using the `func_2` function, which in turn uses the `func_1` function to compute modular inverses. These calculations are performed correctly and are necessary for determining the number of permutations.
4. **Modular Arithmetic**: All arithmetic operations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct for handling large numbers and ensuring the result fits within standard integer limits.
5. **Loop Logic**: The loops for calculating the number of permutations are structured correctly, iterating through the indices of prefix and suffix maximums and applying the appropriate combinatorial logic.

Given the above points, the code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
