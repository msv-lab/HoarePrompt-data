### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it against the problem description and the example provided.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums of a permutation.
- We need to count the number of permutations that could match these indices.
- The solution should handle large inputs efficiently and output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Functions `func_1` and `func_2`:**
   - `func_1` appears to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for finding modular inverses.
   - `func_2` uses `func_1` to compute a modular inverse and then multiplies it by `a` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - These functions are not directly related to solving the permutation problem.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic constructs permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - It calculates combinations using the factorial precomputed in `facts`.
   - The logic seems to correctly handle the constraints and compute the number of valid permutations.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- **Precomputation of Factorials (`facts`):**
  ```python
  facts = [1]
  ch = 1
  for i in range(1, 200002):
      ch *= i
      ch %= 1000000007
      facts.append(ch)
  ```
  This part precomputes factorials up to \(200001\) and stores them in `facts`.

- **Reading Input and Checking Validity:**
  ```python
  for _ in range(int(input())):
      (n, m1, m2) = map(int, input().split())
      p = list(map(int, input().split()))
      s = list(map(int, input().split()))
      if p[-1] != s[0] or p[0] != 1 or s[-1] != n:
          print(0)
      else:
          ans = 1
          kol = n
  ```
  - It reads the input and checks if the first and last elements of `p` and `s` are consistent with the permutation constraints.
  - If not, it prints `0` immediately, indicating no valid permutation exists.

- **Calculating Combinations:**
  ```python
  for x in s:
      cnk = func_2(facts[kol - 1], facts[n - x] * facts[kol - 1 + x - n])
      ans *= cnk
      ans %= 1000000007
      kol = n - x
  kol = s[0] - 1
  p2 = []
  for i in range(m1 - 2, -1, -1):
      p2.append(p[i])
  for x in p2:
      cnk = func_2(facts[kol - 1], facts[x - 1] * facts[kol - x])
      ans *= cnk
      ans %= 1000000007
      kol = x - 1
  for i in range(m1 - 1):
      ans *= facts[p[i + 1] - p[i] - 1]
      ans %= 1000000007
  for i in range(m2 - 1):
      ans *= facts[s[i + 1] - s[i] - 1]
      ans %= 1000000007
  print(ans)
  ```
  - It calculates the number of valid permutations using combinations and modular arithmetic.
  - The logic correctly handles the constraints and computes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code does indeed solve the problem correctly. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used correctly within the context of the problem, and the overall logic is sound.
