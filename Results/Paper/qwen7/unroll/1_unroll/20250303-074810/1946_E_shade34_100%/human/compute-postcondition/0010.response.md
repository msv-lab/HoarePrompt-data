Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer where `b` is not zero and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `a` is not divisible by `b`; `c` is the result of `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `d` is the second return value from `func_1(b, a % b)`**.

This means that the function `func_1` has been called with arguments `b` and `a % b`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values of `c` and `d`, but we know they are the results of the function call. The conditions on `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
