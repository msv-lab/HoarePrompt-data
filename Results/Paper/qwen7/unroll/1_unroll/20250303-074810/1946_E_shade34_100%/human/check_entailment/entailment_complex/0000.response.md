### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums of a permutation.
   - We need to determine the number of permutations that could have these indices as their prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The solution involves combinatorial calculations and modular arithmetic.

2. **Key Points in the Solution:**
   - The program initializes factorials up to \(2 \times 10^5\) and uses them to calculate combinations.
   - It checks if the first and last indices of prefix and suffix maximums match the constraints.
   - It calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial methods and modular arithmetic.

3. **Analysis of Each Part:**
   - **Initialization of Factorials:** The `facts` list is precomputed to avoid repeated calculations.
   - **Checking Constraints:** The program checks if the first and last indices of prefix and suffix maximums match the required conditions. If they do not, it prints 0 immediately.
   - **Combination Calculations:** The program uses the `func_2` function to compute combinations and then multiplies them together to get the total number of valid permutations.
   - **Modular Arithmetic:** All operations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Verification of Correctness:**
   - The logic for checking the constraints is correct.
   - The combination calculations are implemented correctly using the `func_2` function.
   - The overall approach of using combinatorial methods to count valid permutations is sound.
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the result fits within the required bounds.
