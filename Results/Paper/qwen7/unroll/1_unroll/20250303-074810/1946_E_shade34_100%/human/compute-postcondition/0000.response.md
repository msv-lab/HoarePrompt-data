Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (c, d) such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^9 + 6 and d ≠ 0, `c` is a value returned from `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, `d` is a value returned from `func_1(b, 1000000007)`**.

In this state, the function `func_1` has been called with `b` and `1000000007` as arguments, and it has returned two values which are assigned to `c` and `d`. The initial state of `a` and the structure of `b` remain unchanged.
