### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Program Analysis:
The program iterates over each test case and checks for specific conditions to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The key part of the program is the loop that checks for invalid configurations:
```python
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
        print('No')
        break
else:
    print('yes')
```

This loop checks the following conditions:
1. If the current column `i` has a left arrow (`<`) and the next column `i+1` in the second row also has a left arrow (`<`).
2. If the current column `i` has a left arrow (`<`) and the previous column `i-1` in the second row also has a left arrow (`<`).

If either of these conditions is met, the program prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' at the end of the loop.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary states that the function checks for invalid configurations where two consecutive left-pointing arrows face each other directly. This is consistent with the program's logic.

However, the original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it only checks certain conditions and does not account for other valid paths. Let's verify this claim.

#### Verification:
To verify the correctness, we need to check if the program handles all possible valid paths correctly. Consider the example provided in the problem description:
```
4
6
<>><>>
><<<>
```

The program should correctly identify that the robot can reach the cell (2, 6) through the following path:
1. (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6)

The program does not find any invalid configurations in this case, so it should print 'Yes'. This is consistent with the expected output.

Another example:
```
4
>>><
>><<
```

Here, the program finds an invalid configuration at `i=1` and `i=3`:
1. At `i=1`, `a[1] == '>'` and `b[2] == '<'`.
2. At `i=3`, `a[3] == '<'` and `b[4] == '<'`.

The program correctly identifies this and prints 'No', which is also consistent with the expected output.

Given these examples and the function summary, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the function summary. It checks for invalid configurations and handles them appropriately, ensuring that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n) if such configurations exist.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the function summary.
