Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes t test cases, where each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even) and a 2xn grid with arrows pointing either left (<) or right (>). For each test case, it determines the overall direction of arrows in the grid and returns a result based on the majority direction of arrows.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving a 2x n grid with arrows. It checks the majority direction of the arrows in each grid and returns the result accordingly.
