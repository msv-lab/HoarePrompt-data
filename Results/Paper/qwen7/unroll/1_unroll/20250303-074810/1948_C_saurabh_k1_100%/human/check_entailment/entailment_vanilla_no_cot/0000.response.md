Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Reachability:**
   - The logic in the loop checks only certain conditions and breaks early if those conditions are met. However, this does not fully capture the necessary conditions for the robot to reach the cell (2, n).

2. **Handling All Possible Paths:**
   - The solution only checks specific patterns (`a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`) and stops if these conditions are met. This is insufficient because the robot can follow different paths and still reach the target cell.

3. **Edge Cases Not Considered:**
   - The solution does not handle all edge cases properly, such as when the robot can move through the grid in a way that eventually reaches the target cell (2, n).

### Correct Solution:
To correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n), you need to ensure that the robot can move from the starting cell (1, 1) to the target cell (2, n) by following the arrows. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def can_reach_target():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Check if the robot can move from (1, 1) to (2, n)
        # The robot must be able to move down at some point
        if 'v' not in a or 'v' not in b:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if the robot can move right from (1, 1) to (2, n)
        can_move_right = True
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == '>' and b[i] == '<':
                can_move_right = False
                break
        
        if can_move_right:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

can_reach_target()
```

This solution checks if there is a path that allows the robot to move down from the first row to the second row and then move right to the last column. It ensures that the robot can follow a valid path to reach the target cell (2, n).
