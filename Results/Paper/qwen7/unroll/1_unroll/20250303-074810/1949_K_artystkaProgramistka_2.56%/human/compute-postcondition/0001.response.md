Output State: **`numbers` is a list of n sorted positive integers in descending order; `group_a` is an empty list; `group_b` is an empty list; `group_c` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes three empty lists named `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. The list `numbers` remains unchanged as no operations were performed on it.
