Output State: **`numbers` is a list of n sorted positive integers in descending order; `group_a` is an empty list; `group_b` is an empty list; `group_c` is an empty list; `sum_a` is 0; `sum_b` is 0; `sum_c` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes three variables `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` to 0. The lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` remain empty, and the list `numbers` remains unchanged.
