Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over the `numbers` list using the variable `num`. Therefore, the objects in the loop head are `num` and `numbers`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `numbers` is a list of `n` sorted positive integers in descending order.
   - `num` will take on each value from the `numbers` list during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `numbers` must contain at least one element. Since `numbers` is a list of `n` sorted positive integers, if `n` is greater than 0, the list will have at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `numbers` has at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `num` will be the first element of the `numbers` list when the loop starts.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `numbers` must have at least one element (i.e., `n > 0`).
- `num` will be the first element of the `numbers` list when the loop starts.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`numbers` must have at least one element (i.e., `n > 0`), `num` is the first element of the `numbers` list**.
