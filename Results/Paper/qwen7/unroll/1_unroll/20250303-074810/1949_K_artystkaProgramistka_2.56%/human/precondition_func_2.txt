num is an integer, and sum_a, sum_b, sum_c, group_a, group_b, group_c, na, nb, and nc are defined such that na + nb + nc = n, where n is the length of the input list of integers. Additionally, sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c represent the current sums of the numbers in group_a, group_b, and group_c respectively, and group_a, group_b, and group_c are lists that will store the numbers in their respective groups.
