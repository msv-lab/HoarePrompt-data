Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to minimize the cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions in the queue. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The code reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads the number of people in front (`na_frente`) and the maximum allowable final position (`pos_final`).
3. **Cost Arrays**: It reads and stores the costs `a_i` and `b_i` for each person in the queue.
4. **Backward Iteration**: The loop iterates backward from the last person to the first, calculating the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the allowed range.
5. **Cost Calculation**: 
   - If moving to a position `v` is within the allowed range (`v <= pos_final`), it updates the best cost and adds the appropriate cost (`a_v` or `b_v`).
   - If moving to a position `v` is outside the allowed range, it only adds the cost of moving to the next position (`a_v` or `b_v`).
6. **Output**: Finally, it prints the minimum cost for each test case.

The logic handles all the constraints and examples provided, ensuring that the cost calculation is accurate and efficient. Therefore, the program is correct.
