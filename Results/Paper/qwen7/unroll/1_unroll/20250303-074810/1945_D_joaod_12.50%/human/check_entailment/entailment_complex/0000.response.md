Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`), and for each test case, it reads `na_frente` (number of people in front of Kirill) and `pos_final` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill). It also correctly reads the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.

2. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `total` and `best` are initialized correctly. `total` keeps track of the cumulative cost, and `best` stores the minimum cost found during the iteration.

3. **Loop Logic**: 
   - The loop iterates backward from `na_frente` to `0`. This ensures that the program considers the cost of moving Kirill from his current position to positions further back in the queue.
   - The logic inside the loop correctly updates `best` and `total` based on whether it is cheaper to swap positions with the person in front or to pass through them.
   - The conditions for updating `total` and `best` are correctly implemented, ensuring that the minimum cost is tracked appropriately.

4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which matches the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
