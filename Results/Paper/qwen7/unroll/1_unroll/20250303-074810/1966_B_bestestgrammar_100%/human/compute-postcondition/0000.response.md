Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. All other preconditions remain valid.**

This means that `t` now holds the value entered by the user, converted to an integer, and it must be within the range of 1 to 10^4. The other preconditions, such as the existence of multiple test cases, the values of `n` and `m`, and the grid, remain unchanged.
