Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of size n x m where n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, where t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the function determines the count of 'W' and 'B' cells in the grid and returns the count of 'W' cells.**

This means the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, each with its own grid, and for each grid, it counts the number of 'W' cells. The function does not take any direct parameters but works with the grid size and content provided within the scope of the function for each test case.
