Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are the same color. If they are different, it assumes it's impossible to make all squares the same color. However, this assumption is incorrect because the program does not consider other possible configurations that could lead to all squares being the same color.

For example, consider the following grid:

```
B W B
W B W
B W B
```

In this case, the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors ('B' and 'W'), so the program incorrectly outputs 'NO'. However, it is possible to make all squares the same color by performing the following operations:

1. Select positions (1, 1) and (3, 3) to color all squares in the subrectangle from (1, 1) to (3, 3) to the same color.
2. Select positions (1, 2) and (3, 2) to color all squares in the subrectangle from (1, 2) to (3, 2) to the same color.

After these operations, all squares in the grid will be the same color. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this case.
