Based on the initial state provided:

- `bipartite` is `False`
- `n` is the same input integer
- `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user
- `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `True`
- `coef` is a list of length `n` where some elements may be set to `1` and others remain `None`
- `tot` is the sum of all `tot` values from successful `dfs` calls
- `ok` is `False`

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
