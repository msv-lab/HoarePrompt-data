The function accepts an integer `n`, and three lists `x`, `y`, and `r` of length `n`. It also takes two lists `visited` and `coef`, both of length `n`. The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the input data to determine if the graph represented by `x`, `y`, and `r` is bipartite. If any DFS call results in the graph being bipartite and the total sum `tot` is not zero, `ok` is set to True. Finally, the function prints 'YES' if `ok` is True, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
