Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `y` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `r` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` initialized to False, and `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to None.**

Explanation: The code `r = [None] * n` initializes the list `r` to a list of `n` elements, each set to `None`. All other lists (`x`, `y`, `visited`, `coef`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
