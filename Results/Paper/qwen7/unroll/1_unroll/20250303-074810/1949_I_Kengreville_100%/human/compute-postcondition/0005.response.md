Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `y` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `r` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to False, `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `coef` is now a list of length `n` initialized to `[None, None, ..., None]` (where there are `n` elements).**

Explanation: The code initializes the `coef` list to a list of `n` `None` values. All other lists (`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`) remain unchanged.
