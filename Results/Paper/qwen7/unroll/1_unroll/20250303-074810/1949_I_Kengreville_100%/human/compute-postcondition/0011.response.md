Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to False, `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `tot` is 0, `ok` is False.**

Explanation: The line `ok = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `ok`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
