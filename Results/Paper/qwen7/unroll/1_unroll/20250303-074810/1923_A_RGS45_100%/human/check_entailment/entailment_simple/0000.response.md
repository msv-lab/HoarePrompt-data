Reasoning:
1. The problem requires moving chips to the left until they form a single block with no free cells between them, minimizing the number of operations.
2. The provided solution does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it finds the first and last occurrences of '1' (chips) in the string representation of the array and counts the zeros between these positions.
3. This approach is flawed because:
   - It does not account for the need to move chips to the leftmost possible position.
   - It does not handle cases where multiple chips need to be moved to form a single block.
4. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   1
   8
   0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
   ```
   - The solution would find the first '1' at index 1 and the last '1' at index 6, and count the zeros between them (1 zero). However, the correct solution would involve moving the chip at index 5 to index 3, resulting in only 1 operation, which matches the expected output.
5. Another example:
   ```
   1
   5
   1 0 1 0 1
   ```
   - The solution would incorrectly count the zeros between the first and last '1' (2 zeros), but the correct solution involves moving both chips to the leftmost possible position, requiring 2 operations.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
