Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Specifically, the program does not account for the correct distance to move each chip to the nearest free cell to the left. Instead, it attempts to find the positions of the first and last chips ('1's) and calculates the number of zeros ('0's) between them, which does not necessarily represent the minimum number of operations.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
The correct output should be `1` because moving the chip in the 7th position to the 5th position achieves the goal. However, the program incorrectly counts the number of zeros between the first and last '1's, which would give `3` in this case.

Another example where the program fails is:
```
5
5
1 0 1 0 1
```
The correct output should be `2`, but the program will output `0` because it incorrectly counts the number of zeros between the first and last '1's.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is thus incorrect.
