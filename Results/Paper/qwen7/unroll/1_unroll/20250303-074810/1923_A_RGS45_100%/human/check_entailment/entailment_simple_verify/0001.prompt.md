You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the i-th cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1); in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: After running the loop for `t` iterations, the output state will consist of the count of '0's in the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n-y`, where `x` is the first occurrence of '1' from the left, and `y` is the first occurrence of '1' from the right in the string `arr`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of cells.
   - It then reads a string of `n` characters where '0' indicates a free cell and '1' indicates a cell with a chip.

2. **Finding Positions of Chips:**
   - The program converts the input string to a single string by removing spaces using `split()` and `join()`.
   - It finds the index of the first '1' (chip) using `arr.find('1')`, storing this in `x`.
   - It finds the index of the last '1' (chip) from the right using `arr[::-1].find('1')`, storing this in `y`. Note that `[::-1]` reverses the string, so `y` is actually the distance from the end of the string to the last '1'.
   - It extracts the substring `z` from `x` to `n - y`.

3. **Counting Free Cells Between Chips:**
   - The program counts the number of '0's (free cells) in the substring `z` using `z.count('0')`.

4. **Output:**
   - The result of `z.count('0')` is printed for each test case.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Chip Positions:**
   - The logic to find the positions of the first and last chips is flawed. The program only considers the first and last chips but does not account for multiple chips in the middle.
   - The program assumes that moving the farthest chip to the left will solve the problem, which is not always true.

2. **Handling Multiple Chips:**
   - The program does not handle cases where there are multiple chips in the middle. It only considers the first and last chips, which might not be optimal.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Operations:**
   - The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. It simply counts the free cells between the first and last chips, which is not the correct approach.

### Correct Solution

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all chips and ensure that they are moved optimally to form a single block. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        chips = [i + 1 for i, x in enumerate(arr) if x == 1]
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of operations
        min_operations = len(chips) - 1
        for i in range(len(chips) - 1):
            min_operations = min(min_operations, chips[i + 1] - chips[i] - 1)
        
        print(min_operations)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
