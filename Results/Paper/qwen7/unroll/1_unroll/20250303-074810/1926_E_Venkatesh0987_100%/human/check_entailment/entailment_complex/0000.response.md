Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the \( k \)-th card that Vladislav lays down based on his specific pattern of laying out cards.
2. **Key Points**:
   - Cards are laid down in increasing order of their multiples of odd numbers.
   - For the first half of the cards (up to \((n+1)/2\)), the \( k \)-th card is simply \( 2k - 1 \).
   - For the second half, the logic involves calculating the position within the sequence of multiples of odd numbers.
3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the two main cases:
     - When \( k \leq (n + 1) / 2 \): It directly prints \( 2k - 1 \).
     - When \( k > (n + 1) / 2 \): It calculates the position within the sequence of multiples of odd numbers.
   - The logic for the second case is implemented using variables like `s`, `d`, `i`, `h`, `p`, and `g` to track the progress and compute the correct position.
   - The final result is computed using the formula \( y = 2^{(i-1)} \times (2f - 1) \), which matches the expected behavior of the problem.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
