Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t`, a positive integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. For each test case, it generates a string based on the count of each unique element in the reversed list `a`, minus one, using the first 26 letters of the English alphabet. The function then prints this string for each test case.**
