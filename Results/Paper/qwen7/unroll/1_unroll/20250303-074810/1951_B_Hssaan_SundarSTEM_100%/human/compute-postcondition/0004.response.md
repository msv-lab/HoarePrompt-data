Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `s` of `n` distinct integers. It swaps the first element of `s` with the element at index `k-1`. Then, it counts the number of elements in `s` that are greater than or equal to the first element (`ans`). After that, it swaps the element at index `p` (where `p` is the position of the first element greater than the first element) with the element at index `k-1`. Finally, it counts the number of elements in `s` that are greater than or equal to the first element again (`ans1`). The function outputs the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` for each test case.**
