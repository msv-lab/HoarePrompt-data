Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Swapping Logic**: The swapping logic in the code is flawed. The code swaps the positions of the first cow and the cow at position `k` twice, which is unnecessary and incorrect. The goal is to find the optimal swap position for cow `k`, not just swap with the first cow.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Wins**: The logic for calculating the maximum wins is also incorrect. The code checks if cow `k` can win from its initial position without any swaps and then considers a hypothetical swap with the cow at position `p`. However, it does not correctly simulate the tournament structure after the swap.

3. **Logic for Finding Optimal Swap Position**: The code does not properly identify the optimal position to swap cow `k` to maximize its wins. It should consider all possible positions where cow `k` could be swapped and calculate the maximum wins for each scenario.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
1. Identify the optimal position to swap cow `k` to maximize its wins.
2. Simulate the tournament with the swapped cow and count the number of wins.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the optimal position to swap
        max_wins = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if i + 1 == k:
                continue
            # Swap cow k with cow at position i
            ratings[k-1], ratings[i] = ratings[i], ratings[k-1]
            wins = 0
            current_max_rating = ratings[0]
            for j in range(1, n):
                if ratings[j] > current_max_rating:
                    wins += 1
                    current_max_rating = ratings[j]
                else:
                    break
            max_wins = max(max_wins, wins)
            # Swap back to original positions
            ratings[k-1], ratings[i] = ratings[i], ratings[k-1]
        
        print(max_wins)

func()
```

This solution iterates through all possible positions to swap cow `k` and calculates the maximum number of wins for each scenario. It then prints the maximum wins found.
