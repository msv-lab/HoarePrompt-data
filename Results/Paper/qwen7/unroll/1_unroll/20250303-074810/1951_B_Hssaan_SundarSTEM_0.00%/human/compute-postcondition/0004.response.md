Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers \( n \) and \( k \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) distinct integers. It then swaps the first element of the list with the \( k \)-th element, calculates two values \( ans \) and \( ans1 \) based on certain conditions involving these elements, and finally prints the maximum of these two values. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results.**
