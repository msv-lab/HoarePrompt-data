Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer `t` as a parameter, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it also accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the given parameters.**

This means the function takes a number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it processes values of `n` and `k`, along with a list `a` of unique integers, and produces some output based on these inputs.
