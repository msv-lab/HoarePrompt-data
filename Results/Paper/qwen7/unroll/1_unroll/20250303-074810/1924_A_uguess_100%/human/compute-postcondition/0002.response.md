Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` will be reduced to an input integer, `n`, `k`, and `m` will be set to values entered by the user, `s` will contain a string entered by the user, and `ans` will either contain a string that satisfies the conditions or will be constructed based on the last iteration's state if the conditions are not met. If `cnt` (the count of valid substrings) is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` will contain the constructed string with 'YES' printed. Otherwise, `ans` will contain a specific constructed string with 'NO' printed.**
