Output State: **`t` is reduced to an input integer, and all other variables (n, k, m, s) are yet to be assigned values**.

This means that the variable `t` has been updated to the value of the integer input, while `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain undefined and will be assigned values in subsequent code executions.
