Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `A` is a list containing integers calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` is a list of indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` is an empty list**.

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `B`. This operation does not affect the values of `s`, `A`, or `idx_A`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and a new empty list `B` is created.
