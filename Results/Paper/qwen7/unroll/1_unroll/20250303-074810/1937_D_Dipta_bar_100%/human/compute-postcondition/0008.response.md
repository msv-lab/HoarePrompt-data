State: **`idx_B` is an empty list, `s` is a string of length `n`, `A` is a list containing integers calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` is a list of indices where '>' appears in `s`, `j` is 0** 

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `j` is defined in the loop head and its initial value is set to 0.
- The loop runs as long as `j` is less than `n`.
- Therefore, to ensure the loop can start executing, `j` must be initialized to 0.

The other variables (`idx_B`, `s`, `A`, `idx_A`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect whether the loop can start executing. Hence, they do not need to be adjusted.
