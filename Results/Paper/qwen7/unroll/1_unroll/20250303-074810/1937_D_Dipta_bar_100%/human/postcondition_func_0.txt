The function accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and calculates and prints a sequence of numbers based on the positions of these characters. Specifically, it computes values `a` and `b` using lists `A` and `B` and their respective indices, then prints results derived from these values and the current index `i`. The final output is a series of numbers generated by the formula `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` or `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` depending on the conditions met during each iteration through the string `s`.
