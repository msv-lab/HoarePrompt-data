You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Example

    ><<
    
    4
    
    <<<<

Output

    1 4 7 10 8 1 
    
Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

The movement of the pinball for i=2 is shown in the following pictures. It
takes the pinball 6 seconds to leave the grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to compute the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - However, the logic implemented in `func_1` is flawed and does not accurately simulate the pinball movement as described in the problem statement.

3. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function attempts to precompute times for pinballs starting from the left and right ends of the grid, but it does not correctly handle the inversion of directions and the actual movement of the pinball.
   - The variables `A` and `B` are intended to store these precomputed times, but they are not filled correctly.
   - The logic to update `A` and `B` based on the direction of the pinball is incorrect and does not account for the inversion rule properly.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main loop in the `for` block after `func_1` tries to use the precomputed values to determine the time for each pinball starting position.
   - However, this approach is fundamentally flawed because the precomputed values do not reflect the actual movement of the pinball due to the inversion rule.

### Detailed Issues:
- **Incorrect Precomputation:**
  - The `A` and `B` arrays are meant to store the time taken for pinballs starting from the left and right ends, respectively. However, the logic to fill these arrays is incorrect and does not follow the problem's rules.
- **Inversion Rule Not Properly Handled:**
  - The program does not correctly handle the inversion of directions when the pinball moves. Each time the pinball moves, the direction should be reversed, but this is not done in the current implementation.
- **Complexity and Edge Cases:**
  - The solution attempts to handle complex cases with precomputation, but this approach is overly complicated and does not work as expected.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the logic and the precomputation, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
