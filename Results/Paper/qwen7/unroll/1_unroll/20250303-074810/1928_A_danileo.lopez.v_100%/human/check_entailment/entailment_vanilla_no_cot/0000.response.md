Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Checking Even Dimensions**: For each test case, the program checks if either `a` or `b` is even:
   - If `a` is even, it splits the rectangle into two equal halves along the `a` dimension (i.e., both resulting rectangles have dimensions `a//2` by `b`). It then checks if the new dimensions (`a1` and `a2`) are not equal to the other dimension `b`. If they are not equal, it prints "Yes" indicating that another rectangle can be formed.
   - Similarly, if `b` is even, it splits the rectangle into two equal halves along the `b` dimension (i.e., both resulting rectangles have dimensions `a` by `b//2`). It then checks if the new dimensions (`b1` and `b2`) are not equal to the other dimension `a`. If they are not equal, it prints "Yes".
3. **Odd Dimensions**: If neither `a` nor `b` is even, the program directly prints "No" since no further splitting can result in different dimensions.

The logic correctly handles all the test cases provided in the example, including edge cases where the original dimensions are odd or even. Therefore, the program is correct.
