Output State: The output will consist of 'Yes' or 'No' for each iteration based on the conditions provided in the loop. Specifically, if either `a` or `b` is even, and the halved value of the even number does not match the other number, 'Yes' will be printed; otherwise, 'No' will be printed. If neither `a` nor `b` is even, 'No' will always be printed. The exact sequence of 'Yes' and 'No' depends on the input values for each iteration.
