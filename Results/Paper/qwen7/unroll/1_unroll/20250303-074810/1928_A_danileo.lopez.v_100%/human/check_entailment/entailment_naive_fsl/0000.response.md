Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where the rectangle can be divided into smaller rectangles that can be recombined to form a new rectangle. 

Consider the test case `2 6`. According to the problem description, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can then be combined to form a 4x3 rectangle. However, the program incorrectly prints "No" for this case because both dimensions (2 and 6) are not even. 

To fix this, the program needs to check if either dimension can be split into two equal parts, and then verify if the resulting smaller rectangles can be recombined to form a new rectangle. The current implementation only checks if the original dimensions are even, which is insufficient.
