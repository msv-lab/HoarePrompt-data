Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case.
- For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) of the rectangle.
- The logic checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even:
  - If \(a\) is even, it checks if \(a / 2 \neq b\).
  - If \(b\) is even, it checks if \(b / 2 \neq a\).
- If either condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed.
- If neither condition is true, it prints 'No', indicating that no other rectangle can be formed.
- The program correctly handles all the given examples and follows the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
