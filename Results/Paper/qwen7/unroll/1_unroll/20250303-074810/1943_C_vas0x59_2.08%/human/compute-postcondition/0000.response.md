Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `u2vs` remains the same list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with n vertices.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. However, the initial state of `u2vs` is not altered by this line of code. Therefore, `u2vs` still represents the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, and `n` now holds the input integer value within the specified range.
