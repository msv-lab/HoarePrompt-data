Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `u2vs` is a list of n empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list of `n` empty lists, where each sublist represents an adjacency list for a vertex in the tree. Since `n` is an input integer between 1 and 2000, `u2vs` will be a list containing `n` elements, and each element in this list will be an empty list `[]`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the structure of `u2vs` is updated to reflect this new initialization.
