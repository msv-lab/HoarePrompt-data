Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `u2vs` is a list of n lists where each list contains its corresponding index's adjacent indices after processing all the input pairs (u, v); `d` is a list of integers representing the shortest distance from node 0 to each node, and `_` is the second value returned by bfs which is not used.**

Explanation: The code `d, _ = bfs(0)` executes a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from node 0. It returns two values: `d`, which is a list of integers representing the shortest distance from node 0 to each node in the graph, and `_`, which is the second value returned by the BFS function but is not used in the assignment. The variable `u2vs` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the BFS function call.
