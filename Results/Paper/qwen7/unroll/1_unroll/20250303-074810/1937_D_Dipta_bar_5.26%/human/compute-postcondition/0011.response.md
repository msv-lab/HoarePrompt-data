Output State: **`l` is 0, `idx_B` is a list of integers representing the indices of '<' characters in `s` from right to left, and `B` is a list of integers where each element is calculated based on the positions of '>' in `s` according to the given logic inside the loop.**

Explanation: The line `l = 0` initializes the variable `l` to 0. This does not affect the lists `idx_B` or `B`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state of `idx_B` and `B` while updating `l` to 0.
