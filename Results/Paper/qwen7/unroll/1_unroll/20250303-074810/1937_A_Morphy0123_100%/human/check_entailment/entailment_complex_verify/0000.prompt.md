You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program: 
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import log2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each `i` from `0` to `n_cases-1`, the output consists of either `1`, `2 ** power` where `power` is an integer, or no output if the input `n` was not `1`. Each `n` is processed independently based on its value, and the results are printed during the execution of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. It calculates and prints the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`, unless `n` is 1, in which case it simply prints 1. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the `swap` operation as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program attempts to find the largest divisor of `k` using a logarithmic approach, which is incorrect. The largest divisor of `k` that is not equal to `k` itself should be found through iteration, not by using logarithms.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- For `n = 6`, the initial array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- Performing `swap(2)` swaps `a_1` and `a_2`, resulting in `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- Performing `swap(3)` swaps `a_2` and `a_3`, resulting in `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6]`.
- Performing `swap(4)` swaps `a_3` and `a_4`, resulting in `[2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6]`.
- Performing `swap(5)` swaps `a_4` and `a_5`, resulting in `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 6]`.
- Performing `swap(6)` swaps `a_4` and `a_6`, resulting in `[2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 1]`.

After all the swaps, the element `1` is at position `6`. However, the provided program incorrectly calculates the position of `1` as `2^power`, which does not match the expected result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
