Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. It calculates and prints the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`, unless `n` is 1, in which case it simply prints 1. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results directly.**
