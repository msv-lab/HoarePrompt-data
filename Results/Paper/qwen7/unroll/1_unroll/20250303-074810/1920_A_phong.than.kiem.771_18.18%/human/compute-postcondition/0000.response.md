Output State: **`string` is a string, `substring` is a string such that `substring` is not empty and appears at least once in `string`, `indices` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `indices`. This does not affect the values of `string` or `substring`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `string` and `substring`, while introducing a new variable `indices` which is now an empty list.
