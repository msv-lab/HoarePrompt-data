Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Use of `dp` Array:**
   - The `dp` array is initialized to store results for a sequence of moves, but the logic to compute the number of configurations is flawed.
   - The `dp` array should be used to count the number of ways to place rooks on an \(n \times n\) board without attacking each other, considering the constraints of the problem.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Configurations:**
   - The current implementation uses a dynamic programming approach that does not correctly account for the specific constraints of the problem (i.e., the mirroring of moves and the fact that the board size decreases due to occupied rows and columns).
   - The `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])` line is not appropriate for calculating the number of configurations. This line simply returns the value from the `dp` array adjusted by the number of invalid positions, which does not reflect the actual combinatorial solution required.

3. **Missing Combinatorial Logic:**
   - The solution should involve combinatorial counting to determine the number of valid configurations after the initial moves.
   - The program lacks the necessary logic to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the reduced board after accounting for the initial moves and their mirrored counterparts.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
- Track the rows and columns that are already occupied.
- Calculate the number of available rows and columns for placing rooks.
- Use combinatorial methods to count the number of valid configurations for the remaining board.

Here is a more accurate approach to solving the problem:

```python
from math import comb
from functools import lru_cache

MOD = 1000000007

@lru_cache(None)
def count_configurations(n, k):
    if k == 0:
        return 1
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    # Calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining board
    ways = 0
    for i in range(1, n - k + 1):
        ways += count_configurations(n - i, k - 1) * comb(n - k, i - 1) % MOD
    return ways % MOD

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    invalid = set()
    for _ in range(k):
        r, c = map(int, input().split())
        invalid.add(r)
        invalid.add(c)
    valid_rows = n - len(invalid)
    valid_cols = n - len(invalid)
    print(count_configurations(valid_rows, k))
```

This approach uses combinatorial counting and memoization to efficiently compute the number of valid configurations.
