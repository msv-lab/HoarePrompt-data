Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Import Statements and Recursion Limit Setting**:
   - The program starts by importing `sys` and setting the recursion limit to 400,000 using `sys.setrecursionlimit(400000)`. This is necessary because the problem involves potentially large values of `n`, and setting a high recursion limit ensures the program can handle deep recursive calls.
   - A list `dp` is initialized with -1 values up to 300,007, and a function `func_1` is called with 300,000 as an argument. This suggests that `dp` is intended to store results of some dynamic programming calculations.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.

3. **Tracking Invalid Positions**:
   - A set `invalid` is used to track positions that are already occupied by rooks. This is done by adding `r` and `c` for each of the `k` moves.
   - The size of this set gives the number of positions that are already invalid.

4. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**:
   - The program uses a precomputed DP array `dp` to calculate the number of valid configurations.
   - The value `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on an `i x i` board without any two rooks attacking each other.
   - The formula used in the loop is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`, which seems to be derived from combinatorial logic related to placing non-attacking rooks.

5. **Output Calculation**:
   - The number of valid configurations for an `n x n` board with `k` invalid positions is calculated as `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`. This accounts for the fact that even if all positions are invalid, there is still one valid configuration (no rooks placed).

### Verification:

- **Base Cases**:
  - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correctly defined.
  - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` appears to be correct for calculating the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks.

- **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**:
  - The `dp` table is initialized to -1, and the function `func_1` populates it using the given recurrence relation. This ensures that the table is precomputed and ready for use.

- **Input Handling**:
  - The program correctly handles the input and tracks invalid positions.

- **Output Calculation**:
  - The calculation of the number of valid configurations using `dp[n - len(invalid)]` is correct.

Given that the program follows the correct logic and uses appropriate data structures and calculations, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
