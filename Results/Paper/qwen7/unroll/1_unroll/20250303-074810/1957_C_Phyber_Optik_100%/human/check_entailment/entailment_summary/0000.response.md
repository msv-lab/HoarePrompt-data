Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of unique final configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard after \(k\) moves, considering the mirroring effect of the computer's moves. The solution uses dynamic programming to precompute the number of configurations for smaller board sizes up to \(300,000\).

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The `dp` array is initialized to store the number of configurations for each board size from 1 to 300,000. The base cases are defined as `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. For larger sizes, the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is used.

3. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the board size \(n\) and the number of moves \(k\). It then reads the positions of the rooks placed during the initial \(k\) moves and stores them in a set `invalid`.

4. **Configuration Calculation**: After processing the initial moves, the code calculates the number of valid configurations for the remaining board size by using the precomputed `dp` values. Specifically, it uses `dp[n - len(invalid)]` to find the number of configurations for the remaining board space, taking into account the occupied rows and columns.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers, ensuring the output fits within standard integer limits.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described in the problem statement and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
