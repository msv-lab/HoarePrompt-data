### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it against the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description and Constraints
- We need to calculate the number of different final configurations of an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where each move places a rook and the computer mirrors the move.
- The program should account for the constraints that no two rooks can attack each other (i.e., they cannot be in the same row or column).
- The solution must handle the mirroring behavior of the computer's moves.
- The final configurations are counted modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Function Summary
- The function `func_1` computes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on an \( i \times i \) board such that no two rooks attack each other.
- The formula used in `func_1` is \( dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007 \).

#### Analysis of the Program
1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized using the provided formula in `func_1`.
   - This correctly computes the number of valid configurations for smaller boards up to \( n \).

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It then reads \( k \) moves, storing them in a set `invalid`.

3. **Configuration Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of valid positions left on the board after the initial moves.
   - It uses `dp[n - len(invalid)]` to get the number of configurations for the remaining board size.
   - This step assumes that the remaining board size is directly related to the number of invalid positions, which is a simplification.

#### Issues in the Program
- The program does not fully account for the mirroring behavior of the computer's moves. The computer's moves are mirrored, but the program does not adjust the `dp` values accordingly.
- The program assumes that the remaining board size is simply \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \), which is incorrect because the mirroring behavior affects the valid positions.
- The `dp` values are precomputed and do not dynamically adjust based on the specific moves made.

#### Correct Approach
- To correctly solve the problem, we need to account for the mirroring behavior and the constraints of no two rooks attacking each other.
- The `dp` values should be adjusted based on the specific moves made, not just the remaining board size.
- The program needs to dynamically compute the valid configurations for the remaining board, considering the mirroring behavior.

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the number of different final configurations. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the mirroring behavior and the constraints of the problem, making it incorrect for the given task.
