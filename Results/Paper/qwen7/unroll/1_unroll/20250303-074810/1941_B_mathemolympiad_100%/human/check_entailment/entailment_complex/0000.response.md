Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function. The function processes each test case individually.
- It reads the number of test cases (`numTest`), and for each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`a`).
- The function then iterates through the array from index 0 to `n-3` (since it performs operations on `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2` indices).
- During this iteration, it checks if any element becomes negative. If so, it immediately prints 'NO' and stops further processing for that test case.
- After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If not, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
- The function does not return any value but prints the result directly for each test case.
- Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the function correctly determines whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.

Correctness: **True**
