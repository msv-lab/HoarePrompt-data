Output State: **`numTest` is an input integer, and all other variables are in their initial state.**

Explanation: The code `numTest = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `numTest`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `numTest` will be within this range. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`) remain in their initial state as no operations are performed on them in this code snippet.
