Output State: **`ans` is a list containing the elements [1, 2, 4, 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]**.

The code appends the value `2 * k + 1` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains the elements `[1, 2, 4, 3, k + 1]`. After appending `2 * k + 1`, the list becomes `[1, 2, 4, 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
