Output State: **`ans` is a list containing the elements [1, 2, 4, 3]**.

Explanation: Initially, `ans` is a list containing the elements [1, 2, 4]. The code snippet appends a new element to the list `ans`. The new element is calculated as `k - 1 - sum(ans)`. Here, `k` is not defined, but since it's not specified and no other variable `k` is mentioned, we assume `k` is the length of the list `ans` before the append operation, which is 3. So, `sum(ans)` is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. Therefore, the new element is `3 - 1 - 7 = -5 + 1 = 3`. Hence, the updated list `ans` is [1, 2, 4, 3].
