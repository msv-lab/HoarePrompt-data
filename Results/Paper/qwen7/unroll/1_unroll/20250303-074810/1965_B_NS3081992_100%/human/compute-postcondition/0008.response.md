Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^6\), `k` is 1, `b` is a binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `ans` is `[2, 3]`, and `n` is not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code initializes the list `ans` with the values `[2, 3]`. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, and the condition that `n` is not equal to 2 remain unchanged.
