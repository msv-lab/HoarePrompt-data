Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of elements in list `b` using the `cnt_b` list. It then checks if the count of common elements between lists `a` and `b` meets or exceeds the value `k`. If so, it increments the answer counter. After processing each test case, it resets the `cnt_b` list to all zeros. The function does not return any value but prints the total count of test cases that meet the specified condition.**
