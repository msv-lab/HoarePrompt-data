Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: t (an integer between 1 and 10^4), n (an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^5), m (an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^5, and k (an integer between 1 and 10^4). Additionally, it accepts two lists: a (a list of n integers, each between 1 and 10^6) and b (a list of m integers, each between 1 and 10^6). The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the input according to the given constraints.**
