Reasoning:

1. The program correctly initializes `cnt_b` as a list of zeros with a length of `max_val + 1`, where `max_val` is set to `1000000`.
2. For each test case, the program reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.
3. It counts the occurrences of each element in `b` using `cnt_b`.
4. It then iterates through the first `m` elements of `a` to check how many of these elements are in `b` and update the count in `cnt_b`.
5. It checks if the current count of matching elements (`curr`) is greater than or equal to `k`. If so, it increments the answer (`ans`).
6. The program then slides a window of size `m` across the rest of the array `a` (from index `m` to `n-1`), updating the count in `cnt_b` and adjusting `curr` accordingly. If the count of matching elements (`curr`) is still greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.
7. After processing each test case, the program prints the value of `ans` and resets `cnt_b` to all zeros for the next test case.
8. The logic for checking and updating the count of matching elements is correct and handles the sliding window approach properly.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
