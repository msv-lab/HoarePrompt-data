Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Deciding Video Types**: The logic used to decide whether a transition video should be funny (`F`) or scary (`S`) is flawed. Specifically, the program tries to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type appear for any permutation of scenarios. However, the current implementation does not properly account for all permutations and does not guarantee that the condition will be met for every possible order of scenarios.

2. **Incomplete Handling of Undecided Videos**: The program attempts to assign `F` or `S` to undecided videos (`?`) based on some heuristic (e.g., assigning `F` if both `i` and `j` are in the first quarter of `sa` or `sb`). This approach is overly simplistic and does not ensure the required condition holds for all permutations.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Quarters**: The program uses `sa[:n // 4]` and `sb[:n // 4]` to decide the type of videos, which does not necessarily cover all cases where the condition needs to be checked. The quarters should be calculated based on the actual distribution of `F` and `S` values across all scenarios, not just the first quarter of the list.

4. **Missing Consideration of Existing Decisions**: The program does not fully consider the existing decisions made for transition videos. It should ensure that the new assignments do not violate the condition even when considering the fixed transitions.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, possibly involving graph theory or dynamic programming techniques to ensure the condition is met for all permutations. The current implementation does not provide a comprehensive solution to the problem as stated.
