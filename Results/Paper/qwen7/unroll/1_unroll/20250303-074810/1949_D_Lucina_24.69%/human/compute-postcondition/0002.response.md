Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length n+1 containing only zeros, and `b` is a list of length n+1 containing only zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `b` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the list `a` is still a list of length `n + 1` containing only zeros. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `b` and retains the initial state of `n` and `a`.
