Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).
   - `i` is initialized to 1 (as per the `range(1, n + 1)`).

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - Initially, `i` is set to 1, so the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Given the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 24\), this condition is always satisfied.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is within the specified range and that the loop can start executing. Given the constraints, `n` must be at least 2 (the minimum value in the range).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `i` is already set to 1, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1**
