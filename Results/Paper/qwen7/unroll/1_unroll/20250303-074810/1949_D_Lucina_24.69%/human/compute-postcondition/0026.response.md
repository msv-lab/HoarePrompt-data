Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length n+1 where each element is the count of 'F' received from the input for each index, `b` is a list of length n+1 where each element is the count of 'S' received from the input for each index, `xx` is a list containing n elements, each being the input string received during each iteration of the loop, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. After the loop executes, if `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, `sa` is updated to include all indices `i` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `nx` is a string generated based on the conditions provided. Otherwise, `sb` is updated to include additional indices `i` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `nx` is a string generated based on the conditions provided.**
