n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line corresponds to the transition video between the i-th and the j-th scenarios. It will be F if the corresponding transition video will be funny, S if the corresponding transition video will be scary, ? if the corresponding transition video is still undecided, or . if i=j. At most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos will already be decided, meaning at most 2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input will be F or S.
