Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a 2D grid represented by n lines, where each line contains n characters indicating the type of transition video between scenarios. The characters can be F (funny), S (scary), ?, or . (no transition video specified). The function ensures that the grid is symmetric and that at most half of the transition videos are already decided. The function returns a specific output based on the given constraints and relationships between the input parameters.**

Note: The exact output is not specified in the problem statement, but the functionality describes what the function does with the input parameters.
