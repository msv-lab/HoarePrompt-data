You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, where the j-th character of the i-th line corresponds to the transition video between the i-th and the j-th scenarios. Each line contains n characters, which can be F (funny), S (scary), ?, or . (no transition video specified). It is guaranteed that the i-th character of the j-th line and the j-th character of the i-th line are the same for all i and j. At most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided, meaning at most 2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input are F or S.

#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a 2D grid represented by n lines, where each line contains n characters indicating the type of transition video between scenarios. The characters can be F (funny), S (scary), ?, or . (no transition video specified). The function ensures that the grid is symmetric and that at most half of the transition videos are already decided. The function returns a specific output based on the given constraints and relationships between the input parameters.
