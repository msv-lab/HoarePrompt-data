Output State: `A` is True, `not_c` is True, and `arr[0]` is equal to 1, `set_` is [1]

Explanation: The loop runs for the length of `set_`, which is initially [1]. Since the length of `set_` is 1, the loop does not execute because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include the length of `set_`. Therefore, the values of `A` and `not_c` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `arr[0]` and `set_` also remain unchanged.
