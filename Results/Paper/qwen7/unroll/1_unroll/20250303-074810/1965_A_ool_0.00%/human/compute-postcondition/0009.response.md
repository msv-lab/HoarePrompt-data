Output State: `A` is True, `not_c` is True, and `arr[0]` is equal to 1, `set_` is [1]

Explanation: The loop runs from `i=1` to `len(set_)`, but since `set_` only contains one element `[1]`, the loop does not execute at all. Therefore, the value of `A` toggles once (from False to True) and `not_c` remains True. The values of `arr[0]` and `set_` remain unchanged.
