The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5) and `k` (an integer between 0 and 10^12). It manipulates a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n` by moving the last element to the front repeatedly until `k` becomes zero or less. If the condition `1 + i > k` is met during the iteration, the function stops early. The final state of the list `l` is returned.
