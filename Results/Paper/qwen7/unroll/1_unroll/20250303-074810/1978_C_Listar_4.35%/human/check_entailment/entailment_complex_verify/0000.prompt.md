You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5) and `k` (an integer between 0 and 10^12). It manipulates a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n` by moving the last element to the front repeatedly until `k` becomes zero or less. If the condition `1 + i > k` is met during the iteration, the function stops early. The final state of the list `l` is returned.

    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and `k` is even. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is (n - 1) / 2. If `n` is even, `max_k` is `n`.
    if (max_k < k) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two zeros (0, 0)
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and `k` is even, and `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.

    #The program returns n, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, and k, which is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12 and k is even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( 0 \leq k \leq 10^{12} \). It then checks if \( k \) is even. If \( k \) is odd, it returns two zeros (0, 0). Otherwise, it calculates the maximum possible value of \( k \) based on \( n \), and if \( k \) exceeds this maximum, it also returns two zeros (0, 0). If \( k \) is within the valid range, it returns \( n \) and \( k \).

    print()
    #This is printed: ''
    return
    #The program returns an empty value since there is no value being returned in the given code.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `l` representing a valid permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value equal to `k`. It prints "YES" followed by each element of the list `l` separated by a space. After printing, the function concludes without returning any value.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, k) are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12. n is the length of the permutation, and k is the required Manhattan value.

        #This is printed: 'NO'
        return
        #The program returns 0 for `n` and an integer `k` such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12; `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`. `n` is not equal to 0
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_3(l)
    return
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no direct parameters but uses values `n` and `k` obtained from `func_2()`. If `n` is not zero, it calls `func_1(n, k)` and then `func_3(l)`, where `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`. If `n` is zero, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately. The function returns 0 under certain conditions or None otherwise.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not fully address the problem description. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not handle all possible cases correctly. 

1. **Function `func_2`**: This function checks if `k` is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. However, it does not provide a way to construct a permutation that achieves the exact Manhattan value `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function attempts to construct a permutation based on the value of `k` and the length `n`. However, it does not handle all possible values of `k` correctly. For example, consider the case where `n = 3` and `k = 1`. The function should return a permutation like `[3, 1, 2]` or `[2, 1, 3]`, but it does not guarantee this.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function prints "YES" and the constructed permutation. However, it does not handle the case where no valid permutation exists.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function integrates the above functions to solve the problem. However, it does not handle all cases correctly. For instance, it does not handle the case where `k` is odd, which is not possible since the Manhattan value of a permutation is always even.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 3`, `k = 1`
- Expected Output: A permutation like `[3, 1, 2]` or `[2, 1, 3]`
- Actual Output: The provided code does not guarantee to produce such a permutation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to handle certain cases as required by the problem description.
