Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2()`**: This function checks if `k` is even and calculates the maximum possible `k` based on `n`. If `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible `k`, it returns `(0, 0)`. Otherwise, it returns `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**: This function manipulates a list `l` to achieve a specific Manhattan value `k`. It moves the last element to the front of the list repeatedly until `k` becomes zero or less. If the condition `1 + i > k` is met, it stops early.

3. **Function `func_3()`**: This function prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` and then returns. The list `l` is expected to have a Manhattan value equal to `k`.

4. **Function `func_4()`**: This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_2()` to get `n` and `k`, then `func_1()` to generate the permutation, and finally `func_3()` to print the result. If `n` is zero, it prints "NO".

Given the problem statement and the provided functions, let's verify the correctness:

- **Step-by-Step Verification**:
  - `func_2()` ensures that `k` is even and within the valid range for the given `n`.
  - `func_1()` generates a permutation with the desired Manhattan value `k`.
  - `func_3()` correctly prints the permutation.
  - `func_4()` correctly handles both cases: when a valid permutation exists and when it doesn't.

The overall logic of the program aligns with the problem requirements. Each function performs its intended task, and the flow of the program ensures that the correct output is produced based on the input.

Therefore, the given program meets the problem description and the execution states provided.

Correctness: **True**
