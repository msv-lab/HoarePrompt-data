Functionality: **The function accepts parameters t, n, k, q, a, b, and d. t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. n and k are integers such that k is less than or equal to n and both are between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. q is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive. a is a strictly increasing list of k integers where each element is between 1 and n inclusive and each element is less than the next. b is a strictly increasing list of k integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive and each element is less than the next. d is an integer between 0 and n inclusive. The function processes t test cases, each containing n, k, q, a, b, and d, and returns a result for each query d based on the given lists a and b.**
