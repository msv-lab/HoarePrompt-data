Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if the logic implemented in the function matches the problem statement and the expected behavior for the queries.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, and `b` for each test case. This part is correct.

2. **Speed Calculation**: The program calculates the speed between each pair of points in `a` and `b`. This is done correctly by computing the differences in positions (`ad`) and times (`bd`), and then dividing these differences to get the speed.

3. **Query Handling**: For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment of the array `a` that the query point `ql` falls into. It then calculates the exact time taken to reach `ql` using the interpolated speed. This part also appears to be correct.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the time for each query as an integer, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the annotations and the logic described in the function, the program seems to follow the correct approach to solve the problem. The key steps—calculating speeds, interpolating times, and handling queries—are implemented correctly.

Therefore, the program should work as intended for the given problem constraints and examples.

Correctness: **True**
