Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed for each query within each test case. For each test case, there will be `q` lines of output, where each line contains the result of a query. Each query involves finding the interpolated value between two points defined by arrays `a` and `b`, based on the position `ql` provided in the query. The interpolated value is calculated using the differences in `a` and `b` arrays and printed as an integer. This process is repeated for `t` test cases.
