Output State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is an integer derived from `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings representing the split input, n and q are integers derived from the input, a is a list of n integers, and each query consists of two integers l and r where 1 â‰¤ l < r â‰¤ n.**

In this step, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx]`, which is `data[0]` since `idx` is initially 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
