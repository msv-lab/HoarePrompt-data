Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. It initializes necessary variables and structures like prefix XOR (`pf`), a map (`mp`) to store the positions of prefix XOR values, and a results list to store the answers for each query.
3. For each query, it calculates the prefix XOR value for the subarray defined by `l` and `r` and checks if the subarray is interesting based on the conditions provided.
4. The logic for determining if the subarray is interesting is sound: it checks if the XOR of the subarray is zero or if there exists a valid split such that the XOR of each part is equal.
5. The program handles the input and output as specified, including the format of the output (each 'YES' or 'NO' followed by a newline, ending with an empty line).

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
