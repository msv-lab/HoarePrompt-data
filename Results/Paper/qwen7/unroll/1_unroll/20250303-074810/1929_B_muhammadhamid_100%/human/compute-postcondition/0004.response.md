Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it prints an integer based on specific conditions: if \( k = 1 \), it prints 1; if \( k \leq 2(n + (n - 2)) \), it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \); otherwise, it prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \). The function does not return any value but outputs a series of integers corresponding to the conditions evaluated for each test case.**
