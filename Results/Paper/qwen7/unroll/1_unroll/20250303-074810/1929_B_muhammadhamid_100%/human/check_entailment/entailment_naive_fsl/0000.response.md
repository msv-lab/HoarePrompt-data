Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider the minimum number of cells required when \( k \) is greater than \( 2 \times (n + (n - 2)) \). According to the problem description, for \( n \times n \) grid, the maximum number of diagonals is \( 4n - 2 \). When \( k > 2 \times (n + (n - 2)) \), the formula used in the program does not provide the correct minimum number of cells to color.

For example, in the test case \( (n=3, k=10) \), the program outputs 6, but according to the problem statement, the correct answer should be 6 as well, but the logic in the program does not cover this scenario properly. The program incorrectly uses `k // 2 + 1` when \( k > 2 \times (n + (n - 2)) \).

To fix this, the program should ensure that when \( k > 2 \times (n + (n - 2)) \), the result should be \( n \), as coloring all cells in one row or column will ensure that all diagonals have at least one colored cell.
