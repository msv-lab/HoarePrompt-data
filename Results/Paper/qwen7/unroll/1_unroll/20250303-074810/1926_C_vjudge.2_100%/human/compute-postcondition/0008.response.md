Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases (t) where each test case involves an integer n. For each test case, if 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, it performs some unspecified operation; if n is less than 1 or greater than 2·10^5, it handles this as an error.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over a range of test cases defined by `t`, and for each test case, it checks if `n` falls within the specified range. However, since the exact operation is not specified in the output, the focus is on the validation and handling of `n` based on its value.
