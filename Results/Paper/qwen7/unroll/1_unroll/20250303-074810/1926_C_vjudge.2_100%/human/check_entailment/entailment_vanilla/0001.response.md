Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program initializes `N` to `2 * 10^5 + 1`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to `N` and stores them in the list `pd`.

2. **Precomputation of Sum of Digits:**
   - For each number `i` from 1 to `N`, it updates `pd[i]` to be the sum of the digits of `i`.
   - This is done using a nested loop where the inner loop processes each digit of `i`.

3. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and prints `pd[n]`.

### Detailed Breakdown

#### Precomputation Logic
- The logic for precomputing the sum of digits is flawed.
- The variable `pd[i]` is being updated incorrectly. Specifically, `pd[i]` should store the sum of the digits of `i`, but the current implementation adds `pd[i-1]` which is not necessary and incorrect.

#### Correct Approach
- Instead of storing cumulative sums, we need to directly compute the sum of digits for each number up to `N`.

### Correct Implementation

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    N = 2 * 10**5 + 1
    pd = [0 for _ in range(N)]
    
    # Precompute the sum of digits for each number from 1 to N
    for i in range(1, N):
        pd[i] = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
    
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(pd[n])

func()
```

### Verification

- The corrected program initializes `pd` correctly.
- It computes the sum of digits for each number from 1 to `N` and stores it in `pd`.
- For each test case, it retrieves and prints the precomputed sum of digits for `n`.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the original program has a logical error in its precomputation step. The corrected program above addresses this issue and should work correctly.

**Correctness:** **False**
