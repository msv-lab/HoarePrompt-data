You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Annotated Code: 
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, alphabet is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, each iteration of the loop modifies the variable `word` based on the value of `n`, resulting in a sequence of strings printed where each string follows specific rules depending on the value of `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's reason through the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - This part is handled correctly.

2. **Encoding Logic**:
   - The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest word that can be encoded to a given integer `n`.
   - It uses the following logic:
     - If `n > 52`, it means the third character is beyond 'z'. This is not possible since we are limited to 3-character words with each character being a lowercase Latin letter ('a' to 'z').
     - If `n > 26`, it means the second character is beyond 'z', which again is not possible.
     - Otherwise, the word is formed by the first two characters being 'a' and the third character being the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where `n <= 3`. In such cases, the word should be 'aaa'.
   - The program also does not handle the case where `n` is between 27 and 52, which requires more complex logic to form the correct word.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed word for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Case 1**: When `n <= 26`
  - The word is 'aaa' because the smallest possible word is 'aaa' and any other combination would be larger.
  - Example: For `n = 3`, the word is 'aaa'.

- **Case 2**: When `n > 26` and `n <= 52`
  - The word is formed by 'a' for the first two characters and the character at position `n - 3` for the third character.
  - Example: For `n = 27`, the word is 'azz' (since 'a' is at position 1 and 'z' is at position 26).

- **Case 3**: When `n > 52`
  - This case is not handled correctly. The program incorrectly assumes the third character is beyond 'z', which is impossible.

### Correctness Evaluation:

- The program fails to handle the edge cases properly, particularly when `n <= 26` and when `n` is between 27 and 52.
- The logic for forming the word when `n > 26` and `n <= 52` is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the failure to handle edge cases and the incorrect logic for forming the word when `n > 26`.

**Correctness: False**
