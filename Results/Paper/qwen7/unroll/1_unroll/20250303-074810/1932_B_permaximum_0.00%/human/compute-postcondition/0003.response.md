Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers. It first checks if the test case count `t` is within the range of 1 to 1000. For each test case, it checks if the integer `n` is within the range of 1 to 100, and then processes a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is within the range of 1 to 10^6. The function does not return a specific value but rather processes the given data according to the specified constraints.**
