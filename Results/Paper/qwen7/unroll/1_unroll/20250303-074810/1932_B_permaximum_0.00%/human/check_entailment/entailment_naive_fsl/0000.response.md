Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the year in which all signs will occur sequentially according to the problem description. For each sign, the program waits until the next multiple of its periodicity that hasn't been reached yet. This approach ensures that the program handles the sequential occurrence of signs correctly. Given the examples and the nature of the problem, the program works as expected for all potential cases.
