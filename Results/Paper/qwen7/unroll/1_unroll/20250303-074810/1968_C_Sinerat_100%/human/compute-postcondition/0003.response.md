Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), and a list `x` of `n-1` integers (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n). It returns a result based on the processed data for each test case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing a positive integer `t`, another integer `n`, and a list `x` of `n-1` integers, and returns a result for each test case based on these inputs.
