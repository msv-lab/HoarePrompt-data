You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5. The array c is a list of n positive integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. Each query is defined by two integers l_i and r_i such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.

    #State: Output State: After processing all test cases, for each query, a 'YES' or 'NO' is printed based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, for each query defined by \(a\) and \(b\), it checks if the number of 1s in the subarray from index \(a\) to \(b\) (inclusive) is at least half the length of the subarray. If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array `c` and a set of queries. For each query defined by indices `a` and `b`, it checks whether the number of 1s in the subarray from index `a` to `b` (inclusive) is at least half the length of the subarray. If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This process is repeated for all queries in each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to determine if a subarray `c[l_i], c[l_i+1], ..., c[r_i]` is "good".
   - A subarray is "good" if there exists another array `b` such that:
     - The sums of elements in both arrays are equal.
     - No element in `a` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
     - All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If a subarray has at least one `1`, it cannot be "good" because we would need another `1` to balance the sum, but no other element can be `1` to satisfy the condition \(a_i \neq b_i\).
   - If a subarray has more than one distinct value, it can potentially be "good". For example, `[2, 3, 2]` can be transformed into `[3, 2, 3]`.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code attempts to count the number of `1`s in the subarray and check if the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of `1`s.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not fully capture the requirement that the subarray must be transformable into another array where no elements are equal.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly determine if a subarray is "good", we should:
     - Check if the subarray contains any `1`s.
     - Ensure the subarray has at least two distinct values.
     - Verify that the sum of the subarray minus its length is non-negative.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the given example:
     - Subarray `[1, 2, 1, 4, 5]` (entire array): Contains `1`, so it's not "good".
     - Subarray `[4]`: Single element, so it's not "good".
     - Subarray `[2, 1, 4]`: Contains `1` and has two distinct values, so it can be "good".
     - Subarray `[1, 2, 1]`: Contains `1`, so it's not "good".

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is "good". It fails to account for the presence of `1`s and the requirement of having at least two distinct values.
