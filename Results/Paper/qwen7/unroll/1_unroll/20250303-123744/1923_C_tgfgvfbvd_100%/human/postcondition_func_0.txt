The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array `c` and a set of queries. For each query defined by indices `a` and `b`, it checks whether the number of 1s in the subarray from index `a` to `b` (inclusive) is at least half the length of the subarray. If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This process is repeated for all queries in each test case.
