Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `p` and `c`:**
   - The arrays `p` and `c` are being used to count the number of 1s and the prefix sums, but they are not being used correctly to check if a subarray can be transformed into another array satisfying the conditions.
   
2. **Conditions for a Good Subarray:**
   - A subarray is considered "good" if it can be transformed into another array `b` where:
     - The sum of elements in both arrays is equal.
     - No element in the subarray is the same as its corresponding element in `b`.
     - All elements in `b` are positive.
   - The current implementation does not check these conditions properly.

3. **Logic to Determine if a Subarray is Good:**
   - To determine if a subarray is good, we need to check if the subarray can be rearranged such that the sum remains the same, no element is the same as its original position, and all elements in the new array are positive.
   - This requires a more complex approach, possibly involving checking permutations and ensuring the sum condition is met.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
- Calculating the sum of the subarray.
- Checking if the subarray can be rearranged such that no element remains in its original position and all elements are positive.
- Ensuring the sum of the subarray is even (since each element must be swapped with another element).

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
from itertools import accumulate

def is_good_subarray(arr, start, end):
    subarray_sum = sum(arr[start:end+1])
    if subarray_sum % 2 != 0:
        return False
    # Check if the subarray can be rearranged to satisfy the conditions
    # This is a simplified check; actual implementation may require more complex logic
    return True

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        for _ in range(m):
            (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
            if is_good_subarray(arr, a-1, b-1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This code still needs further refinement to correctly implement the logic for determining if a subarray is "good". The `is_good_subarray` function needs to be more robust to handle all edge cases.
