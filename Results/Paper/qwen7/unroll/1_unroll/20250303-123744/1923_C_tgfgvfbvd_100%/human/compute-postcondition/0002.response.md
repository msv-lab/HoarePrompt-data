Output State: After processing all test cases, for each query, a 'YES' or 'NO' is printed based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, for each query defined by \(a\) and \(b\), it checks if the number of 1s in the subarray from index \(a\) to \(b\) (inclusive) is at least half the length of the subarray. If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
