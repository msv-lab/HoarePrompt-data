Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where both `a` and `b` are odd but greater than 1. In such cases, Bob can still form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. 

For example, consider the input `3 3`. According to the problem description, Bob can cut the `3x3` rectangle into two `3x1` rectangles and then rearrange them to form a `1x6` rectangle. However, the current implementation incorrectly outputs "No" for this case because neither `a` nor `b` is even. Thus, the program does not correctly identify that a new rectangle can be formed in this scenario.
