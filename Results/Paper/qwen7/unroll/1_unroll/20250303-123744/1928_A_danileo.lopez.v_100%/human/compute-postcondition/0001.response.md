State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, _ is now 1** 

Explanation:
- The variable `_` is used as a placeholder in the `for` loop and is automatically incremented with each iteration. It does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts; its initial value is effectively 1.
- The variable `t` determines whether the loop will execute. Since the loop runs `t` times, `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `t` is a valid positive integer within the given range.
