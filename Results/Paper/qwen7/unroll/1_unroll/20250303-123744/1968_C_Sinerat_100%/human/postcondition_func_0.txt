The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) and a list \( x \) of \( n-1 \) integers (1 ≤ \( x_i \) ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n). For each test case, it initializes a list \( a \) of length \( n \) with the first element set to 1000, and then iteratively updates the subsequent elements of \( a \) by adding the corresponding elements from \( x \). Finally, it prints the list \( a \) for each test case.
