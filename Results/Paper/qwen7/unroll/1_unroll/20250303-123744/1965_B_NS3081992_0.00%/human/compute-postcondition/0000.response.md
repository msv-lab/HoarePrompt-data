Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `func_10()`. This function call determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer (since the loop runs for each value returned by `func_10()`).

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: We need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer for the loop to execute. Since `func_10()` is a function, its return value cannot be directly adjusted in the given state. However, we can infer that `func_10()` should return a positive integer for the loop to execute.

4. **Consider the initial state**: The initial state provides information about the sequence `a` and the integer `k`. These details are not directly relevant to the loop execution since they do not affect the return value of `func_10()`.

Given these points, the only thing we need to ensure is that `func_10()` returns a positive integer. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `func_10()` returns a positive integer.

**State:**
- `func_10()` must return a positive integer.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`func_10()` must return a positive integer**
