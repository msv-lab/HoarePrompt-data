The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, an integer `da`, a list `rank` of integers with the same length as the maximum key in `d` + 1, and a list `processing` of integers with the same length as the maximum value in the union of all lists in `d.values()` initialized to 0. It returns 1 if the length of `d[da]` is 1. Otherwise, it recursively finds the minimum value among the results of calling itself for each element `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0, updates `rank[da - 1]` to this minimum value plus 1, and returns this minimum value plus 1. During this process, the `processing` list is updated to mark elements as processed and then reset.
