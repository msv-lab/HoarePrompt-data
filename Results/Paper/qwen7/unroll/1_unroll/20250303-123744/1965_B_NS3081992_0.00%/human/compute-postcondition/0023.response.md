Output State: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` but not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `ans` is a list containing `[2, k + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code snippet appends `k + 1` to the list `ans`. Since `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (but not equal to 1), `k + 1` is an integer between 2 and `n + 1`. Therefore, `ans` now contains the original first element `[2]` and the new element `k + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
