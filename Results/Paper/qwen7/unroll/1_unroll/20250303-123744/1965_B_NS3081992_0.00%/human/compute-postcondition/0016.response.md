Output State: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` but not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `l` is the length of `b`.**

Explanation: The code `bk = bin(k)[2:]` converts the integer `k` to its binary representation using `bin(k)`, which includes the '0b' prefix. By slicing the string from the third character onwards (`[2:]`), `bk` is assigned the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix. The values of `b`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
