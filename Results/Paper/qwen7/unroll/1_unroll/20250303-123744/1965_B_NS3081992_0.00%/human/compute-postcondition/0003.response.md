Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the sequence `a` meets the specified conditions. Specifically, it checks if there is no subsequence of `a` that sums to `k`, but for all other integers `v` in the range `1 \le v \le n` (where `v \ne k`), there exists a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`. The length of the sequence `a` is at most 25.**
