Output State: `ans` is [2, 3, 4, 8], `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is 1, `k` remains an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is 4, and `n` is not equal to 2.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = l-1`. Given that `l` is the length of `b`, and assuming `b` has at least 4 bits (since it starts with [2, 3] which implies at least 4 bits for the binary representation), the loop will append `2 ** i` for `i` from 2 to 3 (inclusive). Thus, `ans` becomes [2, 3, 4, 8].
