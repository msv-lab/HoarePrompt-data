Output State: **The program returns a string '2', followed by the value of `k + 1`, then '2 * k + 1', and finally '2' joined by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans` is a list containing `[2, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2]`.
- The code `return ' '.join(map(str, ans))` converts each element in the list `ans` to a string and joins them with a space.
- Since `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` but not equal to 1, the exact values of `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` depend on the value of `k`, but they will be converted to strings and joined with spaces along with the other elements from the list.
