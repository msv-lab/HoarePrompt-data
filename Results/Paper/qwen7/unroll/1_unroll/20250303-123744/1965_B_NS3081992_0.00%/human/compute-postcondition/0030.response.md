Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns either the string '1\n2' or a string starting with '2', followed by the value of `k + 1`, then '2 * k + 1', and finally '2' joined by spaces.**

This means the function `func_14` does not take any input parameters. It returns one of two possible strings based on some internal logic. The first case returns the string '1\n2'. The second case returns a string that starts with '2', followed by the value of `k + 1`, then '2 * k + 1', and finally '2', all joined by spaces.
