Functionality: **The function prints a series of numbers generated by `func_14()` for the number of times specified by `func_10()`. The exact numbers printed depend on the implementations of `func_10()` and `func_14()`, but they will be printed in the order generated by these functions. After completing the loop, the function does not return any value; its primary action is outputting the specified numbers to the console.**
