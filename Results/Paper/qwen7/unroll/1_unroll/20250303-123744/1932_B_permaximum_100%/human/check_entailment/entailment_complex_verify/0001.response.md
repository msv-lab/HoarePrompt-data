### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes an empty list `test_cases` to store the details of each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a` of the signs, storing them in a tuple `(n, a)` and appending this tuple to `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case by iterating over the list of integers and updating a variable `current_year` based on certain conditions.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in `a`, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur. This calculation ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one by finding the smallest year greater than or equal to `current_year` that is a multiple of `ai`.
   - After processing all periodicities for a test case, it appends the final `current_year` to the `results` list.

3. **Calculation Logic:**
   - The logic used in the function to calculate the next year is correct. Specifically, the line `next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai` ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`. This is achieved by first dividing `current_year` by `ai` and rounding up to the nearest integer, then multiplying back by `ai`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases well. If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next year is simply `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, it finds the next multiple of `ai` by adding `ai` to `current_year` until it becomes a multiple of `ai`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case, which are the final values of `current_year` for each test case.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program appears to correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur sequentially for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all cases as expected.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
