Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and initializes an empty list `test_cases` to store the details of each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities (`a`), storing them as tuples in `test_cases`.
3. The function `func_1` processes each test case:
   - It initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur by ensuring that the current year plus the periodicity is the smallest multiple of the periodicity that is greater than or equal to the current year.
   - This is done using the condition `if current_year % ai == 0: next_year = current_year + ai` or `next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai` if the current year is not a multiple of `ai`.
   - It updates `current_year` to `next_year`.
4. After processing all periodicities for a test case, it appends the final value of `current_year` to the results list.
5. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly calculates the year in which the nth sign will occur for each test case based on the provided periodicities.

Correctness: **True**
