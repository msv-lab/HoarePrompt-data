### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes an empty list `test_cases` to store the details of each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a` of the signs, storing them in a tuple `(n, a)` and appending this tuple to `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case by iterating over the periodicities `a` and calculating the next year when the sign will occur.
   - The logic for calculating the next year is correct. It ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one by finding the smallest year greater than or equal to `current_year` that is a multiple of `ai`.
   - The variable `current_year` is updated correctly after each iteration to reflect the next required year for the next sign.

3. **Final Year Calculation:**
   - After processing all periodicities for a test case, the final `current_year` is appended to the `results` list.
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `current_year % ai == 0`, ensuring that the next year is correctly calculated.
   - The program also handles cases where `current_year % ai != 0`, ensuring that the next year is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which all signs will occur sequentially for each test case. The annotations and the original assessment accurately describe the program's behavior and reasoning.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
