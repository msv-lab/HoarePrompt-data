Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly reads the number of test cases and initializes an empty list `test_cases` to store the details of each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a` of the signs, storing them in a tuple `(n, a)` and appending this tuple to `test_cases`.
3. The program then calls the function `func_1(t, test_cases)` to process each test case and collect the results.
4. In `func_1`, the function iterates over each test case, extracts `n` and `a`, and initializes `current_year` to 0.
5. For each periodicity `ai` in `a`, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur. This calculation ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one by finding the smallest year greater than or equal to `current_year` that is a multiple of `ai`.
6. After processing all periodicities for a test case, it appends the final `current_year` to the `results` list.
7. Finally, the program prints the results for each test case.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program appears to correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur sequentially for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
