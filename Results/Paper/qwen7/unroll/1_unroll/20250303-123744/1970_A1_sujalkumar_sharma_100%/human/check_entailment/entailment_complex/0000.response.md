Reasoning:
1. The problem description and the annotated program align well with the steps required to perform the balanced shuffle operation.
2. The function `func_1` correctly computes the prefix balance for each character in the input string `s`.
3. The computed prefix balances are stored along with their corresponding indices and characters.
4. The list `prefix_balance` is then sorted according to the rules specified: first by balance in ascending order, and in case of ties, by index in descending order.
5. Finally, the function constructs and returns the resulting shuffled string based on the sorted `prefix_balance` list.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic for performing the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
