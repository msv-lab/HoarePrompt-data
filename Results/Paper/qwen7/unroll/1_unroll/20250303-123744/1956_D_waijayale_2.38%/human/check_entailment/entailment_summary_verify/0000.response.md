### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function Analysis:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function is intended to set the elements of the subarray `[l, r]` to the MEX value of that subarray.
   - However, the current implementation does not correctly compute the MEX value. It simply sets all elements to `r - l + 1`, which is not the MEX of the subarray.
   - The function also incorrectly updates the array elements and appends operations without ensuring the MEX is correctly calculated.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to maximize the sum of the array.
   - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

3. **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`):**
   - This function attempts to maximize the sum of the subarray `[l, r]`.
   - It checks if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to the square of the length of the subarray. If true, it calls `func_1` to set all elements to the MEX value.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively maximizes the sum for the left and right subarrays.

4. **Function 4 (`func_3`):**
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to compute the required values, and prints the results.

#### Correctness Evaluation:

1. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The current `func_1` function does not correctly compute the MEX value. It sets all elements to `r - l + 1`, which is not the MEX of the subarray.
   - The corrected version provided in the original assessment is correct. It computes the MEX value by iterating through possible values until it finds one not present in the subarray.

2. **Recursive Maximization:**
   - The `recursive_maximize_sum` function attempts to maximize the sum by either setting all elements to the MEX value or recursively maximizing the sum for subarrays.
   - The logic seems sound, but it needs to ensure that the MEX is correctly computed and applied.

3. **Overall Logic:**
   - The overall logic of the program is correct. It uses recursion to maximize the sum by setting subarrays to their MEX values.
   - The number of operations is limited to \(5 \times 10^5\), which is sufficient for the problem constraints.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements due to the incorrect MEX computation in `func_1`.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate, and the program needs to be fixed as per the provided corrected version of `func_1`.
