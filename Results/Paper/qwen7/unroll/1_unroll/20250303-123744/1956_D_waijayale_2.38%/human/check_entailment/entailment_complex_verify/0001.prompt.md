You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `a` of non-negative integers within a specified range `[l, r]`. It ensures that all elements in this range are either zero or equal to `r - l + 1`.

The value of `s` is `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 2) / 2` if `l <= i <= r`, otherwise `s` remains unchanged. `l` and `r` retain their original values. If `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, then `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, and if `pos` is not equal to `r`, `pos` is incremented by 1 and the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` is called.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `recursive_maximize_sum` takes two parameters, `l` and `r`, which define a sublist of the input list `a`. It modifies the sublist to maximize the sum of its elements under certain conditions. Specifically, if the sum of the sublist is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1)^2\), it sets all elements in the sublist to \(r - l + 1\) and records the operation. Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the sublist and recursively calls itself on the left and right parts of the sublist excluding the position of the maximum element. The function returns the maximum sum achievable by these operations.

    #State: The loop prints the pairs (l+1, r+1) for each (l, r) in ops. The final output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing two integers separated by a space, representing the printed pairs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the user. It then calls another function `func_2` to compute values `s` and `m`, and a list `ops`. It prints `s` and `m`, and subsequently prints each pair `(l+1, r+1)` for every `(l, r)` in `ops`. The final output consists of multiple lines, each containing two integers separated by a space.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function recursively sets all elements from `l` to `r` to the value `r - l + 1`.
   - The base case is when `l == r`. If `a[l]` is not zero, it sets `a[l]` to zero and appends `(l, l)` to `ops`.
   - The function is called recursively for `l + 1` to `r`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`.
   - It returns the sum of the array `a`, the number of operations `len(ops)`, and the operations list `ops`.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function is designed to maximize the sum of the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`.
   - If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it calls `func_1` to set all elements to `r - l + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and calls itself recursively for the left and right parts of the subarray excluding the position of the maximum element.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input values `n` and `a`.
   - It calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum, number of operations, and the operations list.
   - It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - It then prints each operation in the format `(l + 1, r + 1)`.

### Reasoning

1. **Base Case Handling**: The base case in `func_1` correctly handles the scenario where `l == r` and ensures that the element is set to zero if it is not already zero.

2. **Recursive Operation**: The recursive call in `func_1` ensures that the entire subarray is updated correctly.

3. **Maximization Logic**: In `recursive_maximize_sum`, the logic to check if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` and then setting all elements to `r - l + 1` is sound. This ensures that the subarray is filled with the smallest possible value that maximizes the sum.

4. **Finding Maximum Element**: The logic to find the maximum element and then recursively call `recursive_maximize_sum` on the left and right parts is correct. This ensures that the entire array is processed to maximize the sum.

5. **Output Formatting**: The output formatting in `func_3` is correct, ensuring that the operations are printed in the required format.

Given that the logic in each function is sound and the overall approach correctly maximizes the sum of the array while adhering to the constraints, the program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the analysis of the functions.
