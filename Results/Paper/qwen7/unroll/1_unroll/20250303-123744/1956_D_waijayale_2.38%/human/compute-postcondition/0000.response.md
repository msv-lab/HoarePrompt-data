Output State: **`n` is an input integer, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. However, the initial state of `a` remains unchanged because no code has been provided that modifies `a`. The precondition that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 18\) and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\) is still valid.
