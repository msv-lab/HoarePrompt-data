Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `l` and `r`, which are non-negative integers such that 1 <= l <= r <= n, where n is the length of the list `a`. The function returns the maximum sum possible by performing operations defined by the list `ops` on the sublist of `a` from index `l-1` to `r-1`.**
