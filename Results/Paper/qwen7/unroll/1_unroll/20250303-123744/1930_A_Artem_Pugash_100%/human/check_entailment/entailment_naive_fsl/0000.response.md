Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always selecting the smallest two numbers available on the whiteboard and adding the smaller one to the score. This ensures that the sum of the minimum values of all pairs is maximized, which is the optimal solution for this problem.

Since the program sorts the list and then sums up the elements at even indices (which correspond to the minimum values of each pair), it correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The program works for all given examples and does not miss any edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
