Reasoning:
The given program aims to calculate the maximum score by pairing the smallest available numbers together in each iteration. Here's how the logic works:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - It sorts the list of integers.
   - It iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, summing up the first element of each pair (which are the smallest elements in each pair due to sorting).
   - It prints the accumulated score for each test case.

This approach ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together, which maximizes the score since the score is always added as the minimum of the two chosen numbers. This is an optimal strategy because it ensures that the smallest possible values are used first, thereby maximizing the sum of the minimums.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program correctly implements the required logic to achieve the maximum score.

Correctness: **True**
