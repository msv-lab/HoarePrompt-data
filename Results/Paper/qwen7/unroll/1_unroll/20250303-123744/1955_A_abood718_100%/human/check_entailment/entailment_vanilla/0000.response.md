### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts.
   - The cost can be calculated either at the regular price (`a` per yogurt) or at the promotional price (`b` for two yogurts).

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It then checks if the promotional price for two yogurts (`b`) is less than twice the regular price (`2*a`).
     - If `2*a > b`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually at `a` burles.
     - If `2*a <= b`, it means it's cheaper to use the promotion.
       - If `A` (the number of yogurts) is even, it calculates the total cost as `(A/2) * b`.
       - If `A` is odd, it calculates the cost as `(A//2) * b + a`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for checking the promotional price (`2*a > b`) is correct.
   - The logic for handling even and odd numbers of yogurts is also correct:
     - If `A` is even, buying in pairs is straightforward.
     - If `A` is odd, the program correctly buys as many pairs as possible and then buys the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles all edge cases correctly, including when `A` is odd and when the promotional price is better than the individual price.

5. **Output:**
   - The output matches the expected results provided in the example.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
