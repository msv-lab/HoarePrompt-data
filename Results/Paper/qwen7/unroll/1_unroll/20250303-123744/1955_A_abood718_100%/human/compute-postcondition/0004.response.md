Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers t, n, a, and b. It reads t, then for each of the next t test cases, it reads n, a, and b. Based on the values of a and b, it calculates and prints one of three possible outputs: \(A \times B\), \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\), or \(\frac{A}{2} \times C + B\). After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.**
