Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving three integers \( t \), \( x \), and \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the maximum value of \( i \) such that \( x - n \cdot i \geq 0 \) and either \( x - n \cdot i \) is divisible by \( i \) or \( x - n \cdot (x // i) \) is divisible by \( x // i \). The function then prints this maximum value for each test case.**
