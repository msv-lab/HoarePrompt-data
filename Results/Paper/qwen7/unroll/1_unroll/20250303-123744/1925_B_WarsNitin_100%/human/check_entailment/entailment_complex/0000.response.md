Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `n`.
3. The core logic of the program aims to find the maximum possible GCD (balance) for the sub-problems' difficulties.
4. The program iterates over possible divisors `i` from 1 to the square root of `x`. This is an efficient approach because any divisor larger than the square root would have a corresponding smaller divisor.
5. It checks two conditions for each divisor `i`:
   - If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`.
   - If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `x // i`.
6. The maximum value found during these checks is stored in `ans` and printed at the end of each test case.
7. The logic correctly handles the constraints and examples provided.

Given the analysis, the program appears to follow the correct algorithm to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
