Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers: t, x, and n, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, and 1 ≤ n ≤ x. It returns a value based on the relationship between these integers.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over `t` test cases, and for each test case, it checks the relationship between `x` and `n`. However, since the function definition itself does not specify the exact operation, the description focuses on the parameters and their constraints.
