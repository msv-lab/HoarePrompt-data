Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each value of t, n is an integer read from input, s is a string read from input, and both zero and one are integers initialized to 0. The variable pk is calculated based on the value of n. The variable mini is set to 10^8. The list lst contains integers representing positions in the string s where the percentage of zeros and ones first meets or exceeds 50%. The list final contains the position from lst closest to pk. If no such position exists, final is set to either 0 or n based on the percentage of ones in s. The output is the first element of final for each iteration.
