Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the percentage of satisfied residents on each side of the road. Specifically, the program uses `zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and `one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` to calculate the percentages, but these calculations do not ensure that at least \(\lceil \frac{x}{2} \rceil\) residents are satisfied on each side. Instead, it checks if more than 50% of the residents on each side are satisfied, which is not equivalent to the requirement.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
010111
```
The program should output `3`, because if the road is placed after the third house, there will be 3 houses on the left side with 1 zero (50% satisfied) and 3 houses on the right side with 2 ones (66.67% satisfied). However, the program incorrectly calculates the percentages and does not produce the correct result.
