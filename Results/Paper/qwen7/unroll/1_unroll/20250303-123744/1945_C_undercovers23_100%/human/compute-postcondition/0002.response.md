Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each value of t, n is an integer read from input, s is a string read from input, and both o and z are integers representing the counts of '1' and '0' in s respectively. After executing the loop, final is a list containing a single integer, which is the index of the substring in s where the percentage of '0's and '1's first reaches or exceeds 50%, or 0 or n if no such index exists.
