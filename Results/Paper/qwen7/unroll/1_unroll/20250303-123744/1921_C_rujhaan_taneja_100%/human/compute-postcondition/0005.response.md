Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t`, followed by `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it creates a new list `array2` based on certain conditions involving the input arrays. It then checks if the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of the remaining elements with `b` is less than `f`. If true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". The function does not return any value but prints "Yes" or "No" for each test case.**
