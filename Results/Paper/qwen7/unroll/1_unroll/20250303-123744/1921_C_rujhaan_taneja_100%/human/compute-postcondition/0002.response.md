Output State: The output state consists of "Yes" or "No" printed for each test case based on whether the sum of the adjusted array elements plus the cost of unadjusted elements is less than the given threshold `f`. For each test case, if the condition `sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f` is true, "Yes" is printed; otherwise, "No" is printed.
