### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum cost to travel between two cities.
   - The cost to travel to the closest city is 1 coin.
   - The cost to travel directly to another city is the absolute difference in their coordinates.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code uses two dictionaries (`d1` and `d2`) to store the cumulative costs to reach each city.
   - `d1` calculates the cost to reach each city starting from the leftmost city (index 2).
   - `d2` calculates the cost to reach each city starting from the rightmost city (index `n-1`).

3. **Issues with the Code:**
   - The logic for calculating the cost to reach each city is flawed.
   - The code assumes that the closest city can be found by comparing distances, but it doesn't correctly handle the unique closest city condition.
   - The code does not correctly compute the cumulative costs to reach each city.
   - The code incorrectly uses the dictionaries to compute the minimum cost for each query.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this problem, we need to precompute the closest city for each city.
   - Once we have the closest city for each city, we can efficiently answer each query using these precomputed values.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - Precompute the closest city for each city.
   - Use a segment tree or a similar data structure to efficiently answer the queries.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It fails to properly compute the closest city for each city and incorrectly uses the dictionaries to compute the minimum cost for each query.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
