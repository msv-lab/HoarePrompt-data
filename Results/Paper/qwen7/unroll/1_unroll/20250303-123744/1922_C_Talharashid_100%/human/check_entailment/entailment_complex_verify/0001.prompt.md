You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: Output State: The output state consists of the results of `m` queries for each test case. For each query, if `y > x`, the output is the value of `d1[y] - d1[x]`. If `y <= x`, the output is the value of `d2[y] - d2[x]`. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are computed based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n, a list of n integers a, an integer m, and m queries consisting of pairs of integers (x, y). It then computes two dictionaries, d1 and d2, based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list a. Finally, it outputs the results of the queries, printing the value of d1[y] - d1[x] if y > x, and d2[y] - d2[x] otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum cost to travel between two cities.
   - The cost to travel to the closest city is 1 coin.
   - The cost to travel directly to another city is the absolute difference in their coordinates.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code uses two dictionaries (`d1` and `d2`) to store the cumulative costs to reach each city.
   - `d1` calculates the cost to reach each city starting from the leftmost city (index 2).
   - `d2` calculates the cost to reach each city starting from the rightmost city (index `n-1`).

3. **Issues with the Code:**
   - The logic for calculating the cost to reach each city is flawed.
   - The code assumes that the closest city can be found by comparing distances, but it doesn't correctly handle the unique closest city condition.
   - The code does not correctly compute the cumulative costs to reach each city.
   - The code incorrectly uses the dictionaries to compute the minimum cost for each query.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this problem, we need to precompute the closest city for each city.
   - Once we have the closest city for each city, we can efficiently answer each query using these precomputed values.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - Precompute the closest city for each city.
   - Use a segment tree or a similar data structure to efficiently answer the queries.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It fails to properly compute the closest city for each city and incorrectly uses the dictionaries to compute the minimum cost for each query.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
