Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop `for i in range(t):` will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head that affects the loop's execution, we need to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), we can conclude that `t` will always be greater than 0 when the loop starts. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`.

However, since we need to provide the state explicitly, we can state that `t` is a positive integer within the given range.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
