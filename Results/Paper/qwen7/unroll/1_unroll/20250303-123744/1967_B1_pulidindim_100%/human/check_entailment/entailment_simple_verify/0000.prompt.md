You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` test cases where for each test case, `n` is incremented based on the given logic inside the loop, and the final value of `ans` is printed for each test case. Specifically, for each test case, `ans` is updated by adding the integer division of `(g / count) + 1` where `g` is calculated as `n // count` and `countmins` is `count - 1`. The loop continues until `count` exceeds `m` or the condition `g < countmins` is met.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the program attempts to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) but does not accurately calculate whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To illustrate, consider the test case \(n = 3\) and \(m = 5\):

- According to the problem description, we need to check pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- For \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\):
  - \(a + b = 2\)
  - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\)
  - \(2\) is a multiple of \(1\), so \((1, 1)\) is a valid pair.
- For \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\):
  - \(a + b = 3\)
  - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\)
  - \(3\) is a multiple of \(1\), so \((2, 1)\) is a valid pair.
- For \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\):
  - \(a + b = 4\)
  - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\)
  - \(4\) is a multiple of \(2\), so \((2, 2)\) is a valid pair.
- For \(a = 3\) and \(b = 1\):
  - \(a + b = 4\)
  - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot \gcd(3, 1) = 1\)
  - \(4\) is a multiple of \(1\), so \((3, 1)\) is a valid pair.
- For \(a = 3\) and \(b = 2\):
  - \(a + b = 5\)
  - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 2 \cdot \gcd(3, 2) = 2\)
  - \(5\) is not a multiple of \(2\), so \((3, 2)\) is not a valid pair.
- For \(a = 3\) and \(b = 3\):
  - \(a + b = 6\)
  - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 3 \cdot \gcd(3, 3) = 3\)
  - \(6\) is a multiple of \(3\), so \((3, 3)\) is a valid pair.

The program, however, does not correctly handle these cases. It uses a loop to incrementally count pairs without checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Therefore, the output for this test case would be incorrect.
