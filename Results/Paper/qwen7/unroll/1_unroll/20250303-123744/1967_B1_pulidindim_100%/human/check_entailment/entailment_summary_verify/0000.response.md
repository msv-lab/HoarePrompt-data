Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program does not directly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it increments `n` based on a specific algorithm that does not match the problem requirements. Here's the breakdown of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

### Function Summary Recap
The function summary states that the function calculates and prints an updated value of `n` based on a specific algorithm. However, this summary does not accurately reflect the actual logic implemented in the program. The summary mentions incrementing `n` based on a division operation, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.

### Correct Implementation
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)
```

### Evaluation
- The original assessment stated that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. This is accurate because the provided program does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The function summary also does not accurately describe the actual logic implemented in the program.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is correct.

Final: **False**
