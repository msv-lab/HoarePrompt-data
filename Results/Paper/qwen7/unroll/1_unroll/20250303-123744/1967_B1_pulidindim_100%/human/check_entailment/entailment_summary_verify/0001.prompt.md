You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `t`, `n`, and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints an updated value of `n` based on a specific algorithm. The algorithm involves incrementing `n` by a value derived from dividing `n` by a counter `count`, adjusted by `count - 1`, until the counter exceeds `m` or the division result is less than `count - 1`. The function outputs the final calculated value of `n` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Count Initialization:**
   - The variable `count` is initialized to 2, which seems to be an attempt to start checking from the smallest possible value greater than 1.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop runs while `count` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`, which is unnecessary and might be a mistake.
     - `g` is calculated as `int(n / count)`. This does not represent the greatest common divisor (GCD) but rather the integer division of `n` by `count`.
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.
     - `g` is then adjusted by subtracting `countmins`, which is also unnecessary.
     - `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to itself. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for the conditions specified in the problem.

4. **Output:**
   - The final value of `ans` is printed, which is supposed to be the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of GCD:**
   - The program uses integer division (`n / count`) instead of calculating the GCD, which is incorrect.

2. **Unnecessary Variables and Logic:**
   - The variables `countmins` and the way `g` is adjusted are unnecessary and do not contribute to solving the problem correctly.

3. **Loop Condition and Break Logic:**
   - The loop condition and the break logic are not aligned with the problem requirements. The loop should iterate over all possible values of `b` and check the conditions for each pair `(a, b)`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m` and for each `b`, find the valid `a` values such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It has several logical errors and does not follow the problem's requirements accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
