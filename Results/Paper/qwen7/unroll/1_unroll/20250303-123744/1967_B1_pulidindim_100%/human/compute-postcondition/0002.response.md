Output State: The value of `t` test cases where for each test case, `n` is incremented based on the given logic inside the loop, and the final value of `ans` is printed for each test case. Specifically, for each test case, `ans` is updated by adding the integer division of `(n - (count - 1) * count)` by `count` plus one, until `count` exceeds `m`.
