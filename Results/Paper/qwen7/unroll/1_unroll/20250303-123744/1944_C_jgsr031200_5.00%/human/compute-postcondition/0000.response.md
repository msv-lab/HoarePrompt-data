Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\) and the length of the list is \(n\); nums is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in arr.**

Explanation: The code `nums = collections.Counter(arr)` creates a `Counter` object named `nums` which counts the occurrences of each element in the list `arr`. The initial conditions about `arr` remain unchanged. Therefore, `arr` is still a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\) and the length of the list is \(n\), and `nums` is a `Counter` object that contains the count of each element in `arr`.
