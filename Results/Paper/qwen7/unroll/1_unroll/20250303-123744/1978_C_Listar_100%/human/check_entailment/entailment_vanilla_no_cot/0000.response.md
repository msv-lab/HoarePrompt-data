Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Even and Odd Lengths**: The function `func_4` attempts to calculate the maximum possible Manhattan value for a given `n`. However, the logic used to determine this maximum value is flawed. Specifically, the calculation of `max_k` should consider the correct formula for the maximum Manhattan value, which is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) for odd `n` and \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) for even `n`.

2. **Recursive Function Calls**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are not correctly implemented to solve the problem. They do not handle the construction of permutations with the required Manhattan value effectively. The recursive calls and swapping operations are not aligned with the problem requirements.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The code does not properly handle edge cases where no permutation can achieve the required Manhattan value. For example, when `k` is odd, no permutation can achieve an even Manhattan value, and vice versa.

4. **Output Format**: The output format is not consistent with the problem statement. The code should output "Yes" followed by the permutation if a solution exists, or "No" if no solution exists.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to implement a more robust approach that considers the properties of permutations and the Manhattan distance. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def find_permutation(n, k):
    if k % 2 != 0:
        return "No"
    
    # Calculate the maximum possible Manhattan value
    max_k = (n * (n - 1)) // 2
    if k > max_k:
        return "No"
    
    # Construct the permutation
    perm = list(range(1, n + 1))
    i = 0
    j = n - 1
    while k > 0:
        if k >= (j - i + 1):
            k -= (j - i + 1)
            perm[i], perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            perm[i], perm[i + k] = perm[i + k], perm[i]
            k = 0
    
    return perm

def solve():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        result = find_permutation(n, k)
        if result == "No":
            print("No")
        else:
            print("Yes")
            print(*result)

solve()
```

This corrected version handles the problem correctly by constructing the permutation directly and ensuring that the Manhattan value matches the required value.
