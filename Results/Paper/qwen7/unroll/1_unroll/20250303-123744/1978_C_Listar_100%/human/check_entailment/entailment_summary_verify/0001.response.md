### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \).
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |p_i - i| \).

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**
   - **func_4()**: This function checks if \( k \) is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \). It returns \( (0, 0) \) if \( k \) is odd or if \( k \) exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value.
   - **func_1()**: This function attempts to construct a permutation with the required Manhattan value. It uses a recursive approach with helper functions `func_2()` and `func_3()`.
   - **func_2()** and **func_3()**: These functions swap elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - **func_5()**: This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation.
   - **func_6()**: This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4()` and `func_1()`, and then calls `func_5()` to print the result.

3. **Verification of Correctness:**
   - **func_4()**: Ensures \( k \) is even and within the valid range. If \( k \) is odd or exceeds the maximum possible value, it returns invalid values.
   - **func_1()**: Constructs the permutation by recursively swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value. The logic seems to handle even and odd \( n \) correctly.
     - The function starts by setting \( k \) to \( k // 2 \).
     - It iterates over the list in reverse, trying to adjust the Manhattan value by swapping elements.
     - The helper functions `func_2()` and `func_3()` are used to swap elements in specific positions to reduce the Manhattan value.
   - **func_2()** and **func_3()**: Swap elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value, ensuring the permutation remains valid.
   - **func_5()**: Correctly prints the permutation if found.
   - **func_6()**: Properly handles the input and calls the necessary functions to solve the problem.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases like odd \( k \), odd \( n \), and when \( k \) exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value.
   - The recursive approach in `func_1()` ensures that the permutation is built correctly by adjusting the Manhattan value through swaps.

5. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - **func_1()**: The function logic is somewhat complex, but it aims to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value. However, there are several issues:
     - The function does not handle all cases correctly. For example, if \( k \) is very large, the function may not be able to construct a valid permutation.
     - The function assumes that swapping elements will always lead to a valid permutation, which is not always true. There might be cases where no valid permutation exists, but the function does not handle these cases properly.
     - The function does not check for all possible permutations and may miss some valid permutations.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - While the overall structure of the code seems to address the problem, there are significant issues with the implementation of `func_1()`. The function does not guarantee that it will find a valid permutation in all cases, especially for larger values of \( n \) and \( k \).
