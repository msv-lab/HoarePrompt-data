Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'Yes' and 'No' based on the conditions evaluated in each iteration of the loop. For each line of input provided during the loop, the program checks the relationship between `n` and `m`, and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly. If `t` is the number of iterations, there will be `t` lines of output, each either 'Yes' or 'No', depending on the values of `n` and `m` for that iteration.
