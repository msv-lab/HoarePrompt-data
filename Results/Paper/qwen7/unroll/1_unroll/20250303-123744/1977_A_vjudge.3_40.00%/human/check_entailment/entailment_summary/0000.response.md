Reasoning: 
The provided program checks whether it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves. The logic in the program needs to be analyzed to ensure it correctly handles all possible scenarios.

1. If `n == m`, it means that every move added a cube, which is possible.
2. If `m > n`, it's impossible because you can't add more cubes than the total number of moves.
3. If `m == n - 1`, it means that after adding cubes for `n-1` moves and removing one cube in the last move, it's possible.
4. If both `n` and `m` are even, it's possible to achieve this by adding and removing an equal number of cubes.
5. If both `n` and `m` are odd, it's also possible to achieve this by adding and removing an equal number of cubes.

However, the current implementation has some issues:
- The condition `elif m == n - 1:` is redundant because it can be covered by the general logic of adding and removing cubes.
- The conditions for checking if both `n` and `m` are even or odd should be combined into a single check since they cover the same scenario.

Let's re-evaluate the logic:
- If `n == m`, print 'Yes'.
- If `m > n`, print 'No'.
- If `m == n - 1`, print 'Yes'.
- If both `n` and `m` are even or both are odd, print 'Yes'.
- Otherwise, print 'No'.

Given the execution summary, the program seems to follow these rules correctly. Therefore, the program is logically sound and matches the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
