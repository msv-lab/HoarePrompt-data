Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `num != 0`.
2. **Current state**: 
   - `a` is 0.
   - `num` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `num != 0` must be true. Since `num` is given as a positive integer, it is already non-zero. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `num`.

4. **Conclusion**: The current state already satisfies the loop condition, so no modifications are required.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is 0, `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5**
