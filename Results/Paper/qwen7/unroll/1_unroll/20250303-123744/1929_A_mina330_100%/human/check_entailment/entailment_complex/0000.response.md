Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all integers \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).
- The provided solution sorts the array and prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements, i.e., `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`.
- This approach is incorrect because it does not maximize the beauty of the array as defined. Instead, it simply finds the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the sorted array.
- To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. Sorting the array and taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements does not achieve this.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
