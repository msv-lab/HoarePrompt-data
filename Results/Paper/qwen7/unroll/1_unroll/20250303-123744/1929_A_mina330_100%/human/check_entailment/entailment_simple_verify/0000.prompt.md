You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
        
    #State: Output State: The maximum difference between the largest and smallest numbers among the inputs provided for each iteration, up to a total of ntest iterations, where 1 ≤ ntest ≤ 500.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in the sorting and subtraction logic. The program sorts the array and then subtracts the smallest element from the largest element, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array according to the given definition.

To maximize the beauty, we need to ensure that the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \) are maximized. Sorting the array and taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements only ensures that the first and last differences are maximized but does not guarantee that all intermediate differences are optimized.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
The program outputs `57`, but the correct maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[90, 54, 100, 43, 80]`. This gives us the following differences:
\[ (90 - 54) + (54 - 100) + (100 - 43) + (43 - 80) = 36 - 46 + 57 - 37 = 57 \]

However, another optimal arrangement could be `[100, 90, 80, 54, 43]`, which gives:
\[ (100 - 90) + (90 - 80) + (80 - 54) + (54 - 43) = 10 + 10 + 26 + 11 = 57 \]

In this case, the program fails to find the correct maximum beauty because it only considers the extreme values after sorting. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
