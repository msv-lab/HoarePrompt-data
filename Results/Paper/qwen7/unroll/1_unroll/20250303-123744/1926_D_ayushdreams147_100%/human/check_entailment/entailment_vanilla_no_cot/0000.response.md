Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but contains a logical error. The function `func_1` tries to ensure that no two numbers share the same bit pattern across their 31 least significant bits by using a dictionary to track the presence of the bitwise complement of each number. However, this approach does not correctly handle the requirement of grouping numbers such that any two numbers in the same group do not share the same bit value at any position from 1 to 31.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of the 31-bit binary representation and how to group numbers based on their bit patterns. A more appropriate approach would be to use a bitmask to represent the bit patterns and then use a set or similar data structure to keep track of unique bit patterns.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    bit_patterns = [0] * 32  # Array to store the count of unique bit patterns
    for num in a:
        pattern = 0
        for i in range(31):  # Consider only the 31 least significant bits
            if (num >> i) & 1:
                pattern |= (1 << i)
        bit_patterns[pattern] += 1
    max_groups = 0
    for count in bit_patterns:
        max_groups = max(max_groups, count)
    return max_groups
```

This corrected program works as follows:
1. It initializes an array `bit_patterns` to keep track of the count of unique bit patterns.
2. For each number, it calculates the bit pattern by considering only the 31 least significant bits.
3. It updates the count of the corresponding bit pattern in the `bit_patterns` array.
4. Finally, it determines the maximum count of any bit pattern, which represents the minimum number of groups needed.

This approach ensures that the numbers are grouped correctly based on their bit patterns.
