Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as the value of `int(input())` is a non-negative integer. However, since the problem specifies that `t` (which is the input) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we know that the input will always be a valid non-negative integer within this range.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop will always execute given the constraints on `t`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `t` itself. We need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that satisfies the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
