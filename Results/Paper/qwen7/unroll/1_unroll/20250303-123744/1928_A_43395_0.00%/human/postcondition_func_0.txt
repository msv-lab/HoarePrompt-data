The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it checks specific conditions related to the parity of \(a\) and \(b\) and their difference. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, it prints 'yes'. If the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is equal to \(-a\) or \(-b\), it prints 'no'. If the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd, it prints 'yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no explicit return value, but the output consists of 'yes' or 'no' for each test case.
