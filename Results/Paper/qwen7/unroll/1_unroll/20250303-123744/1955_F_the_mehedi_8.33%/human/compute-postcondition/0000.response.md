Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer. Given the state before the loop, we know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**: Since the loop condition depends on the input from `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input provided will satisfy the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The state before the loop should reflect this.

4. **State the Adjusted State**: The state before the loop should be such that the input will provide a value for `t` within the specified range.

Given these points, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that the input will provide a valid value for `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the input will provide a value for t within this range**
