Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30; `resultats` is a list of non-negative integers or -1 based on the conditions specified in the loop.
