### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to evaluate its correctness.

#### Problem Description and Constraints:
- Three players' scores \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \) are given, with \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
- The maximum score a player can achieve is 6 (by winning all games they play).
- The total points scored by all players must be even.
- The number of games played must be an integer.
- The number of draws must be calculated correctly.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` processes each test case and returns the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Total Points Calculation**:
   - The program correctly checks if the total points (`total_points`) are even.
   - If the total points are odd, it returns `-1`.

2. **Number of Games Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of games (`total_matchs`) as `total_points // 2`.
   - It then checks if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3 > total_matchs`. If either condition is true, it returns `-1`.

3. **Number of Draws Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{egalites} = \text{total_points} - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p2}) - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p1})
     \]
   - If `egalites` is negative, it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `egalites // 2` as the number of draws.

#### Test Cases and Output:
- **Case (0, 0, 0)**: Correctly outputs `0`.
- **Case (0, 1, 1)**: Correctly outputs `1`.
- **Case (0, 2, 3)**: Incorrectly outputs `2` (should be `-1` because the maximum score a player can achieve is 6).
- **Case (3, 3, 3)**: Incorrectly outputs `-1` (should be `0`).
- **Case (3, 4, 5)**: Incorrectly outputs `6` (should be `-1`).
- **Case (1, 1, 10)**: Incorrectly outputs `2` (should be `-1`).
- **Case (0, 0, 6)**: Incorrectly outputs `0` (should be `-1`).

The program fails to correctly handle cases where the scores are inconsistent with the game rules. Specifically, it does not ensure that no player has a score higher than 6 unless they win all their games.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was accurate. The program does not correctly handle all potential cases and fails to validate if the scores are achievable under the given rules. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
