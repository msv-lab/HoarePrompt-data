You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30; `resultats` is a list of non-negative integers or -1 based on the conditions specified in the loop.
    return resultats
    #The program returns a list of non-negative integers or -1 based on the conditions specified in the loop. Each element in the list corresponds to the evaluation of each inner list in `cas_de_test`, where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and `cas_de_test`, a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that `0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30`. It evaluates each inner list according to specific conditions and returns a list of results. Each result in the returned list is either a non-negative integer representing the number of equal matches or `-1` if the conditions are not met.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to check if the scores are consistent with the rules of the game. For instance, consider the input `(1, 1, 10)`. According to the problem description, the maximum score a player can achieve is 6 (by winning all games they play), but the program does not enforce this constraint. The program calculates the number of draws based on the total points and the differences in scores, but it does not validate if the scores are achievable under the given rules. This leads to an incorrect output of `2` for the input `(1, 1, 10)`, which is not possible since no player can have a score higher than 6 without violating the game rules.
