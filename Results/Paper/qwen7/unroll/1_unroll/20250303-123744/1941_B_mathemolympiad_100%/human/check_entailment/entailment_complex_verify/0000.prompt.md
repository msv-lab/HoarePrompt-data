You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a consists of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each element a_j in the array.

    #State: Output State: After executing the loop for all test cases, for each test case, if there exists any negative value in the array `a` before the end of the array (i.e., indices from 0 to n-3), the program prints 'NO' for that test case and moves to the next test case. If no negative values are found and the last two elements of the array are zero, the program prints 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of size `n`. It then iterates through the array, modifying its values based on the first element of each segment of three consecutive elements. If any element in the array becomes negative before reaching the second-to-last element, the function prints 'NO' for that test case and moves to the next one. If the function completes the iteration without finding any negative elements and the last two elements of the array are zero, it prints 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to reduce the array elements to zero by repeatedly applying the operation but does not handle the array correctly. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. The program iterates through the array and checks if any element is less than 0. If it finds such an element, it immediately prints 'NO' and stops further processing. However, this approach is incorrect because it only checks for negative elements after applying the operation, which might not be sufficient to determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros.

2. The program incorrectly applies the operation by setting `a[i] -= opNum`, `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum`, and `a[i + 2] -= opNum`. This logic does not correctly simulate the operation as described in the problem statement. According to the problem, the operation should be applied to indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` respectively, not `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2`.

3. After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements are zero. However, this check is insufficient because the operation might not be able to reduce all elements to zero even if the last two elements are zero.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

The program would apply the operation at index 2 (since `i = 2`), resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 3, 1]`. It would then apply the operation again at index 2, resulting in `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Finally, it would apply the operation at index 3, resulting in `[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]`. At this point, the program would incorrectly print 'NO' because it checks the last two elements and finds them not zero, but it fails to recognize that the array can still be reduced to all zeros with further operations.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem and is incorrect.
