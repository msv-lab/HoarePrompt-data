Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer `n` representing the size of an array `a`, and the array `a` itself, which contains `n` integers. The function returns information based on the array `a` for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own `n` and array `a`. For each test case, it processes the array `a` of length `n` and returns some form of output based on the elements in the array, given the constraints on `n` and the values in `a`.
