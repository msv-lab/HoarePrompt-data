Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the operations allowed by the problem statement. The logic in the given code does not accurately reflect how the operations can be applied to the array. Specifically, the code subtracts values from the array in a way that does not match the problem's operation rules.

To solve this problem correctly, you should check if the sum of every element in the array is even. This is because each operation reduces three elements by a total of `3 * opNum`, which means the parity (odd/even nature) of the sum of the array remains unchanged. If the sum of the array is odd, it is impossible to make all elements zero since zero is even.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(numTest):
        n = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is even
        if sum(a) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This solution checks if the sum of the array is even. If it is, then it is theoretically possible to make all elements zero using the described operations; otherwise, it is not possible.
