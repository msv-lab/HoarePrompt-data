The only variable in the loop head is the `queue`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `queue` being non-empty. Right before the loop, the `queue` contains a single tuple `(start, 0)`. For the loop to execute the first time, the `queue` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, no adjustment is necessary since the `queue` already contains an element.

State: **`queue` is a deque containing a tuple (start, 0), `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the element `start`**
