Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing a tuple (start, 0), `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the element `start`.**

The code creates a set called `visited` and adds the `start` node to it. The values of `queue` and `target` remain unchanged from their initial state.
