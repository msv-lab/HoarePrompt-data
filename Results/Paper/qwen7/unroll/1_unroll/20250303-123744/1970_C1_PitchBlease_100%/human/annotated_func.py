#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, edges is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, and start is an integer representing the starting node for the round. The tree has exactly two leaves, and 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: `tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes, with all edges from `edges` added bidirectionally. The `n` and `start` variables remain unchanged, representing the number of nodes in the tree and the starting node for the round, respectively.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 1 or dist2 % 2 == 1) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns 'Ron'
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (representing the tree's edges), and `start` (the starting node for a round). It constructs a bidirectional tree representation using the given edges. Then, it identifies the two leaves of the tree and calculates the shortest distances from the start node to each leaf. Based on whether these distances are odd or even, the function returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.
