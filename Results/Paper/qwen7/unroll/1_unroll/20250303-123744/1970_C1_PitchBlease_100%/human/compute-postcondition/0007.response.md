Postcondition: **`tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes, with all edges from `edges` added bidirectionally; `leaves` is a list of nodes that have exactly one adjacent node; `dist1` is the distance from `start` to `leaves[0]` calculated using BFS; `dist2` is the distance from `start` to `leaves[1]` calculated using BFS. Either `dist1` is odd or `dist2` is odd.**
