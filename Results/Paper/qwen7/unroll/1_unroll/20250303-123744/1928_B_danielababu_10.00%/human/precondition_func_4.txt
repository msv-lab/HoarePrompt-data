t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is an integer representing the length of the array a, followed by a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n where 1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
