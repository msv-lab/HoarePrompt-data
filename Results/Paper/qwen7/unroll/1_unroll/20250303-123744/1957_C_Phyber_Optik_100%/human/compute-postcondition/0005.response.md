The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5. The functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and does not return any specific value based on the given constraints and relationships. However, it seems the function might be part of a larger context involving test cases and moves, but the direct functionality described here is simply accepting an integer within a specified range.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5.**
