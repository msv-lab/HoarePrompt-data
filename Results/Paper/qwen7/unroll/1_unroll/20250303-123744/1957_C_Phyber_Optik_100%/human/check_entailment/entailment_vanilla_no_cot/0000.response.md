Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly model the problem. The logic in the `func_1` function and the use of `dp` array do not accurately represent the number of possible configurations for the remaining empty cells on the board after the initial k moves.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Use of DP Array**: The `dp` array is used to store results of subproblems, but the recurrence relation used in `func_1` does not correctly represent the problem. The problem requires calculating the number of ways to place rooks in a partially filled board, which is more complex than just filling an array based on previous values.

2. **Invalid Calculation of Configurations**: The formula `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` in `func_1` does not account for the constraints of the problem. Specifically, it does not consider the fact that rooks cannot be placed in the same row or column as existing rooks.

3. **Set Usage**: The `invalid` set is used to track positions where rooks are already placed, but this does not directly help in calculating the number of valid configurations.

To solve this problem correctly, a different approach is needed. One possible approach involves using combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of valid configurations for the remaining empty cells, taking into account the constraints of the problem.

### Correct Approach:
1. Calculate the number of free rows and columns after the initial k moves.
2. Use combinatorial methods to count the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining cells.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import sys
from math import comb

sys.setrecursionlimit(400000)
t = int(input())

def count_configurations(n, k, occupied_rows, occupied_cols):
    free_rows = n - len(occupied_rows)
    free_cols = n - len(occupied_cols)
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining rows and columns
    if free_rows == 0 or free_cols == 0:
        return 1
    
    # Choose free_rows out of free_cols columns
    ways_to_choose_columns = comb(free_cols, free_rows)
    
    # For each choice of columns, calculate the number of ways to place rooks in those columns
    configurations = ways_to_choose_columns * (2 ** free_rows)
    
    return configurations

for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    occupied_rows = set()
    occupied_cols = set()
    
    for _ in range(k):
        r, c = map(int, input().split())
        occupied_rows.add(r)
        occupied_cols.add(c)
    
    print(count_configurations(n, k, occupied_rows, occupied_cols) % 1000000007)
```

This approach uses combinatorial methods to correctly count the number of valid configurations for the remaining empty cells on the board.
