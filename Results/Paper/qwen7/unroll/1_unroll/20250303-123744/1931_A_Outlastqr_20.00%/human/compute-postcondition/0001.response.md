Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 0 because `range(int(input()))` generates numbers starting from 0 up to but not including `int(input())`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`. Therefore, `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 0.

4. **Initial values of the other variables**: The variables `t` and `alphabet` are not used within the loop head, so their initial values do not affect the loop's execution directly. However, `n` is mentioned in the problem statement and should be considered.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `alphabet` is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`.
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 78\).

Since the loop depends on `int(input())`, we need to ensure that `int(input())` is a valid number that makes the loop execute. Given the constraints on `n`, the value of `int(input())` should be at least 3 (the minimum value of `n`).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can start executing, which means `int(input())` must be at least 3.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)
- `alphabet` is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 78\)
- `int(input())` must be at least 3, and `i` is initially 0.

So, the final state is:
**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `alphabet` is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 78\), `int(input())` must be at least 3, and `i` is 0**.
