### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the encoded integer `n`.

2. **Encoding Logic**:
   - If `n > 52`, it means the encoded value is too high for a two-letter combination starting with 'a'. Hence, it calculates the third letter using `alphabet[n - 53]` and appends 'zz'.
   - If `26 < n <= 52`, it means the encoded value can be represented by a combination of 'a', a second letter, and 'z'. It calculates the second letter using `alphabet[n - 28]` and appends 'z'.
   - If `n <= 26`, it means the encoded value can be represented by 'aa' and the third letter. It calculates the third letter using `alphabet[n - 3]`.

3. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The logic ensures that the word generated is the lexicographically smallest possible word for the given encoded integer.
   - For example, for `n = 24`, the program correctly outputs "aav" because the smallest possible word is "aav" (1 + 1 + 22 = 24).
   - For `n = 70`, the program correctly outputs "rzz" because the smallest possible word is "rzz" (18 + 26 + 26 = 70).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is exactly 26 (outputting "aaa") and when `n` is less than 26 (outputting words like "auz").

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the generated word for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded integer.
