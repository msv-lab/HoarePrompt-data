Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that can be encoded to a given integer `n`.
2. The encoding process sums the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
3. The provided solution attempts to construct the word based on the value of `n` using conditional logic.
4. Let's analyze the logic:
   - If `n > 52`, the word is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. This handles cases where the third letter is beyond 'z'.
   - If `n > 26`, the word is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. This handles cases where the second letter is beyond 'z'.
   - Otherwise, the word is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`. This handles cases where the first two letters are 'a' and the third letter is up to 'z'.

5. The conditions in the code do not cover all possible cases correctly:
   - For `n > 52`, the word should be constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`, which is correct.
   - For `26 < n <= 52`, the word should be constructed as `alphabet[n - 27] + 'az'`, not `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
   - For `3 <= n <= 26`, the word should be constructed as `alphabet[n - 3] + 'aa'`, not `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

6. The provided solution does not handle the middle range (27-52) correctly, leading to incorrect results for some values of `n`.

Correctness: **False**
