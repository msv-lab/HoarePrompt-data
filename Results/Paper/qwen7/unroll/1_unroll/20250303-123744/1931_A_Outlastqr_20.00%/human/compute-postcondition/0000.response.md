Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.**

Explanation: The code initializes the `alphabet` variable with the lowercase English letters using `string.ascii_lowercase`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `t` and `n` while adding the new information about `alphabet`.
