Reasoning:
The given program attempts to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing the specified operations. However, the logic in the program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Specifically, the program checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color and then checks if all other cells in the same row or column as these corners also have the same color. This approach is flawed because it does not account for the possibility of making all cells the same color through a series of operations that may involve more than just the top-left and bottom-right corners.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if the entire grid can be made uniform by ensuring that all cells in the same row or column have the same color. The given solution does not fully address this requirement.

Given the execution summary, the program is checking for a specific condition that is not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
