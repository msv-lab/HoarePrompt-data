Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid and stores the grid in a list `gr`.
3. It initializes `ans` to 'YES' assuming it's possible to make all squares the same color.
4. The program then checks if the top-left (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) cells have the same color. If they don't, it sets `ans` to 'NO' because it's impossible to make all squares the same color.
5. If the top-left and bottom-right cells have the same color, it further checks if there are any mismatches along the top row or the rightmost column. If there are mismatches, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
6. Finally, it prints `ans`.

Given the problem description and the logic implemented in the code, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color based on the given operations.

Correctness: **True**
