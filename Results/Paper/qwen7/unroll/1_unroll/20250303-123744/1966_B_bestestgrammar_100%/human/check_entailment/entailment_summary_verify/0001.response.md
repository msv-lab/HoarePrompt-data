### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using the given operations. An operation allows selecting two squares of the same color and changing the color of all squares within the subrectangle defined by those two squares.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If the top-left corner square and the bottom-right corner square have different colors, it's impossible to make all squares the same color because any operation would only affect a subrectangle that includes both corners.
   - If the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color, we need to check if there are any other conflicting colors in the grid.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \), and the grid itself.
   - It initializes `ans` to `'YES'`.
   - It checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color. If they don't, it sets `ans` to `'NO'` and exits.
   - If the corners have the same color, it further checks if there are any other conflicting colors in the grid by examining the first row and the last column. If any of these checks fail, it sets `ans` to `'NO'`.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the impossible scenario where the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors.
   - However, the additional checks for the first row and last column are unnecessary and incorrect. These checks do not guarantee that the entire grid can be made uniform. For example, consider a 2x2 grid with the following configuration:
     ```
     W B
     B W
     ```
     Here, the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same ('W'), but the grid cannot be made uniform because there are conflicting colors in the middle.

   - The function should only check if the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color. If they do, then it is always possible to make the entire grid the same color by repeatedly applying the operations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program incorrectly includes unnecessary and incorrect checks for the first row and last column. These checks do not contribute to the correctness of the solution and can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

**Final: False**
