Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of size n x m where n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, represented by t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the function evaluates the grid and returns information based on the distribution of 'W' and 'B' cells.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving a grid of specified dimensions filled with 'W' (White) and 'B' (Black) cells. It processes these grids according to the given constraints and returns relevant information about the distribution of 'W' and 'B' cells within each grid.
