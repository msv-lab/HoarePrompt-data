Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each t, there is an integer ans calculated based on the given logic within the loop for each input instance.**

To explain this output state in natural language:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` remains the same as the initial input, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each value of `t`, the variable `ans` is updated according to the operations defined within the loop for each corresponding input instance. The final value of `ans` for each instance is printed at the end of its respective loop iteration. Therefore, the output state includes the same number of `t` values as the initial state, but with updated `ans` values computed from the given logic for each input instance.
