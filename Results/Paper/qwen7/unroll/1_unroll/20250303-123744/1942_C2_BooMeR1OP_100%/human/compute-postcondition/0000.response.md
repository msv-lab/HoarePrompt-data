Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and t is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the input function will assign the input value to `t`, the updated state reflects that `t` is now the input integer. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
