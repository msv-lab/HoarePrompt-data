Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by n, x, and y (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x). Additionally, it receives a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns different outputs based on the conditions specified for each test case.**

This means the function handles multiple test cases, each with specific parameters and a list of integers, and returns outputs based on the given constraints.
