Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), along with a list of \( x \) distinct integers representing chosen vertices. It calculates and prints an integer \( ans \) for each test case based on specific conditions involving these inputs. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has printed the calculated \( ans \) for each test case.**
