Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the `while` loop and the conditions for counting pieces are flawed. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Counting Logic**: The code increments `count` every time there is a change in consecutive characters, which is not always correct. For example, in the string "0101", the code would incorrectly count 4 pieces because it counts changes at every position.

2. **Flag Handling**: The flag `flag` is set to `True` when a '0' is followed by a '1', but this alone doesn't indicate the need for more than one piece. Instead, we need to ensure that all '0's come before any '1's.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        # Find the index where '1' starts
        index_of_one = s.find('1')
        if index_of_one == -1:  # If no '1' is found, the string is already sorted
            print(1)
        else:
            # Count the number of '0's before the first '1'
            count_zeros_before_one = s[:index_of_one].count('0')
            # The number of pieces needed is the count of '0's before the first '1' plus one more piece for the rest
            print(count_zeros_before_one + 1)
```

This corrected function works as follows:
- It finds the index of the first '1' in the string.
- If there are no '1's, the string is already sorted, so it prints 1.
- Otherwise, it counts the number of '0's before the first '1'.
- The total number of pieces needed is the count of '0's before the first '1' plus one more piece for the remaining part of the string.
