Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and for each input string `s`, the variable `count` is calculated based on the rules inside the loop. If there is at least one occurrence where '0' is followed by '1', `count` will be decremented by 1 before printing. The final value of `count` for each string `s` is printed.
