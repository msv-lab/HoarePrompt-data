The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each string `s`, it counts the number of consecutive characters that are different. If there is at least one occurrence where '0' is immediately followed by '1', this count is decremented by one. Finally, it prints the adjusted count for each string `s`.
