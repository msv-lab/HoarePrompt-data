Output State: **`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, and `bipartite` remain unchanged.**

This means that the variable `n` is updated to the integer value entered by the user, while the other variables (`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, and `bipartite`) retain their original values from the initial state.
