Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the year when the nth sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicities of the signs.
2. The annotated program correctly initializes `t` as the number of test cases.
3. For each test case, it reads `n`, the number of signs, and the periodicities `a`.
4. It initializes `year` to 0, which represents the current year.
5. It iterates over each periodicity `ai` and updates `year` by adding either `year % ai` or `ai` to `year`. This ensures that `year` is always a multiple of the current periodicity `ai` after considering all previous periodicities.
6. After processing all periodicities for a test case, it prints the final value of `year`.

Given the logic in the program matches the problem statement and the provided example, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
