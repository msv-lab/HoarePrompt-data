Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - The expression `int(input())`: This is the condition that determines whether the loop should continue.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` initialized to 0, we know that `i` will be 0 at the beginning of the loop.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0. Therefore, the initial value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).

Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, and `t` is the number of test cases, the initial input must be one of these values. For the loop to execute, the first input must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the initial input from `int(input())`.

**State:**
- `i` is 0 (as it is initialized to 0).
- The initial input from `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

So, the final state is:
**`i` is 0, the initial input from `int(input())` must be greater than 0**.
