Output State: The output state consists of a series of integers, each representing the result of the print statement for each test case. For each test case, the result is either 0 or 1 plus the sum of the elements in the list `p` divided by 2. The value 0 or 1 is determined by whether the first three elements of the list `p` (representing counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s) are all odd, and then adding the integer division of the sum of all elements in `p` by 2.

For example, if the input for a test case is "3" followed by "1 2 3 4", the list `p` would be [1, 2, 3, 4]. The expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` evaluates to 0 because not all of the first three elements are odd. Then, `sum(p) // 2` is `10 // 2`, which is 5. So the output for this test case would be `5`.

Output State: A series of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 plus the sum of the elements in the list `p` divided by 2 for each test case.
