You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, there are four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of a series of integers, each representing the result of the print statement for each test case. For each test case, the result is either 0 or 1 plus the sum of the elements in the list `p` divided by 2. The value 0 or 1 is determined by whether the first three elements of the list `p` (representing counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s) are all odd, and then adding the integer division of the sum of all elements in `p` by 2.
    #
    #For example, if the input for a test case is "3" followed by "1 2 3 4", the list `p` would be [1, 2, 3, 4]. The expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` evaluates to 0 because not all of the first three elements are odd. Then, `sum(p) // 2` is `10 // 2`, which is 5. So the output for this test case would be `5`.
    #
    #Output State: A series of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 plus the sum of the elements in the list `p` divided by 2 for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a sequence defined by counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the form of four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200). It then performs some unspecified operation on these counts and returns the result.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
