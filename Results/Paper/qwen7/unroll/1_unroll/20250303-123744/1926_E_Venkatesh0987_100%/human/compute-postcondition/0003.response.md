Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes integers t, n, and k. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and given integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the function returns information based on these inputs.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing three integers: `t`, `n`, and `k`. It checks if `t` is within the range 1 to 50000 (inclusive). If so, it then uses `n` and `k` to determine and return some specific information, though the exact nature of the return value isn't specified in the given constraints.
