Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. After all the executions of the loop have finished, the values of n and k from each test case will be processed according to the given conditions, and the result (a single integer value calculated for each test case) will be printed. The variables `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, and `f` will be reset to their initial values before processing the next test case.
