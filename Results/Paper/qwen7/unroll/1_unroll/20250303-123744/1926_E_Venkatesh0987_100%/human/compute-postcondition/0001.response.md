Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. After executing the loop, the value of `y` is printed for each test case based on the given conditions. The other variables `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` are used during the loop execution but their final states do not affect the output.
