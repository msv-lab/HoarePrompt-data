Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value based on the given conditions. If \( k \) is greater than half of \( n + 1 \), it performs a series of calculations involving variables \( s \), \( d \), \( h \), \( p \), and \( g \) to determine the final output. Otherwise, it directly prints \( 2k - 1 \). After processing each test case, it resets the relevant variables before moving on to the next case.**
