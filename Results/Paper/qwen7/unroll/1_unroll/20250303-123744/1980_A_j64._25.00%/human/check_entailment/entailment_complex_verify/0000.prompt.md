You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

Each element in the list represents the number of missing characters for each test case, calculated as the sum of the maximum differences between `m` and the frequency of each character in the string `a`. The frequencies are determined by counting how many times each character ('A' to 'G') appears in the string `a`, and then calculating how many more occurrences of each character are needed to reach `m` for each character.

    #The program returns a list named `results` which contains `t` elements. Each element in the list represents the number of missing characters for each test case, calculated as the sum of the maximum differences between `m` and the frequency of each character ('A' to 'G') in the corresponding string `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of additional problems of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') needed for each test case to meet the required number of problems (`m`) in the upcoming rounds. For each test case, it counts the frequency of each character in the given string of problem difficulties, then determines the shortfall for each character by comparing these frequencies with the required number of problems (`m`). The function processes `t` test cases and returns a list of these shortfalls for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure he can hold `m` rounds with at least one problem of each required difficulty level. 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. For each test case, the program initializes a frequency array `freq` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
2. It iterates through the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `freq`.
3. It then calculates how many problems are missing for each difficulty level by subtracting the current count from `m` and taking the maximum of 0.
4. Finally, it sums these values to get the total number of additional problems needed.

This approach ensures that for any given test case, the program will accurately compute the minimum number of additional problems required. Since the logic seems sound and the program handles all the provided examples correctly, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
