Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three elements: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, and a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged from their initial state.
