Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads input from standard input using `[*open(0)][1:]`, which reads all lines except the first one. This is not the most common way to read input in Python; typically, you would use `input()` or `sys.stdin`.

2. **Parsing Input:**
   - The program splits each line into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, s.split())`. This part is correct.

3. **Adjusting Extroverts and Universals:**
   - The line `(a, b, c) = (a, b + c, c)` is intended to combine the number of extroverts and universals. However, this is incorrect because it should be `(a, b + c, c)` but the order of assignment is wrong. It should be `(a, b + c, c)` instead of `(a, b, c)`.

4. **Calculating Tents:**
   - The program calculates the number of tents needed using the expression `a - -b // 3`. This is incorrect. The double negative `- -b // 3` simplifies to `b // 3` and then negates it again, which is not what we want. We need to calculate the number of tents required for introverts and extroverts plus universals.

5. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if `c < b % 3` to determine if it's possible to accommodate everyone. This logic is flawed. The correct check should ensure that the remaining universals can be paired with extroverts.

### Correct Solution:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Allocate tents for introverts (`a`).
2. Allocate tents for extroverts and universals combined (`b + c`).

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    for s in sys.stdin:
        a, b, c = map(int, s.split())
        # Calculate the number of tents needed
        tents = a + (b + c + 2) // 3
        # Check if it's possible to accommodate everyone
        if c >= b % 3:
            print(tents)
        else:
            print(-1)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in calculating the number of tents and the incorrect handling of the combination of extroverts and universals.

**Correctness: False**
