### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if we can make all elements of the array zero by repeatedly applying an operation that reduces three specific elements of the array.
   - The operation involves reducing `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The operation can only be applied to consecutive elements in the array.
   - To make all elements zero, the array must be structured in such a way that the operation can be repeatedly applied until all elements are zero.
   - The given code checks the first and last elements of the array to see if they meet certain criteria, which is not sufficient to determine if all elements can be made zero.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The given code only checks the first and last elements. This is insufficient because the operation can only be applied to consecutive elements, and there could be other elements in the middle that prevent the array from being reduced to all zeros.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`. The first and last elements do not meet the criteria, but the array can still be reduced to all zeros as shown in the example in the problem description.

4. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly checks if the first and last elements meet the criteria mentioned above.
   - If either condition fails, it prints 'NO'.
   - However, this is not sufficient to determine if all elements can be made zero. The code does not check the entire array and the possibility of reducing it to all zeros.

5. **Verification**:
   - The logic in the given code does not match the problem requirements completely.
   - The code only checks the first and last elements, which is not enough to determine the possibility of making all elements zero.
   - There are test cases where the first and last elements meet the criteria, but the array cannot be reduced to all zeros.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The code only checks the first and last elements, which is insufficient to determine if all elements can be made zero.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
