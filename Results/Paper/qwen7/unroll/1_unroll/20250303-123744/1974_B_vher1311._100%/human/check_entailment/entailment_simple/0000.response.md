Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
2. The `func_1` function is responsible for decoding the encoded string.
3. The function first creates the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters of the encoded string.
4. It then creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
5. Finally, it decodes the encoded string by replacing each character with its corresponding value from the `mapping` dictionary.

Given the problem description and the steps involved in the decoding process, the provided implementation appears to follow the correct logic for decoding the encoded string.

Correctness: **True**
