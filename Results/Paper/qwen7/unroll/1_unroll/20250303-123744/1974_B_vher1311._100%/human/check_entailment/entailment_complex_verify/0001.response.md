### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads input from standard input and splits it into a list of strings. It correctly extracts the number of test cases (`t`), the length of each encoded string (`n`), and the encoded strings themselves. This part is correct.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it correctly extracts the encoded string `b`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with the encoded string `b`. This is correct.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Creating String `r`**: The function `func_1` creates the string `r` by sorting and removing duplicates from the encoded string `b`. This part is correct.
   - **Mapping Characters**: It then creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character in `r`. This is done correctly.
   - **Decoding**: Finally, it decodes the encoded string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding symmetric character from `r`. However, there is a logical error in this step. The dictionary `mapping` should map each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart, but the current implementation incorrectly maps each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart in the reverse order. Specifically, the line `mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}` should be `mapping = {r[i]: r[len(r) - 1 - i] for i in range(len(r))}` to correctly create the symmetric mapping.

4. **Output**: The decoded strings are stored in the `results` list and printed at the end. However, due to the error in the mapping creation, the decoded strings will not be correct.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment concluded that the program is correct, but this conclusion is inaccurate because the mapping creation in the `func_1` function is incorrect. The dictionary `mapping` should map each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart, but the current implementation does not achieve this correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
