### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `x`.
   - It then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it correctly parses the number of people in the queue (`num_fila`) and the maximum allowable final position (`max_p`).

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `custo` to 0, which is used to accumulate the total cost.
   - It then correctly initializes lists `a_values` and `b_values` to store the costs from the input.
   - The program iterates backward from `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1` to calculate the initial cost. This part is correct because it checks whether the cost of moving to the current position is less than the cost of staying at the next position.
   - After calculating the initial cost, the program iterates backward from `max_p - 1` to 1 to ensure that Kirill's final position is within the allowed limit. Here, it checks if moving to the previous position would result in a lower cost compared to staying at the current position. If so, it updates the cost accordingly.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where Kirill needs to move to the first position by adding `a_values[0]` to the cost if necessary.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the accumulated cost for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. There are no apparent errors or logical flaws in the code.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
