### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \).
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).

2. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function checks if \( k \) is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \).
   - If \( k \) is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` because an even number cannot be achieved.
   - If \( n \) is odd, the maximum Manhattan value is \(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\).
   - If \( n \) is even, the maximum Manhattan value is \(\frac{n^2}{2}\).
   - If \( k \) exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value, it returns `(0, 0)`.

3. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function constructs a permutation based on the given \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It initializes a list `l` with numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It iteratively moves elements to the front or back of the list to adjust the Manhattan value until it reaches \( k \).
   - The core logic here is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if 1 + i > k:` is incorrect. This condition should be checking if the remaining steps needed to reach \( k \) are less than or equal to the current index `i`.

4. **Analyzing `func_3`:**
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation and ends with a newline.

5. **Analyzing `func_4`:**
   - This function calls `func_2` to check if a valid permutation exists.
   - If `func_2` returns `(0, 0)`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to construct the permutation and then `func_3` to print the result.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code correctly handles edge cases where \( k \) is odd or when \( k \) exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value.
   - However, the construction logic in `func_1` has a flaw. The condition `if 1 + i > k:` is incorrect and can lead to incorrect permutations.

### Detailed Analysis:

- In `func_1`, the condition `if 1 + i > k:` is incorrect. It should be `if k > 0:`. This condition should check if there are still steps needed to reach \( k \).
- The logic for inserting elements into the list is also incorrect. It should insert elements based on the remaining steps needed to reach \( k \).

### Example to Illustrate the Flaw:

Consider \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \):
- The initial list is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- The correct Manhattan value for `[3, 1, 2]` is `4`, but the current implementation might fail to achieve this.

### Corrected Code:

Here is a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if k == 0:
            return l
        if k > 0:
            x = l[-1]
            l.pop(-1)
            l.insert(0, x)
            k -= 1
    return l
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the condition in `func_1` is incorrect, leading to potential incorrect permutations. The corrected version of `func_1` should use `if k > 0:` instead of `if 1 + i > k:`.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
