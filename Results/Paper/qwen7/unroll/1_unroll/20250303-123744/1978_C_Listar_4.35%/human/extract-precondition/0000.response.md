Precondition: **(n, k) are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12.** 

Note: The variables `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are not defined in the provided program and seem to be placeholders for other functions that are part of the overall solution but not shown here. The precondition focuses solely on the variables passed to `func_4`.
