Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the `func_4` function does not generate a valid permutation for certain inputs, particularly when the required Manhattan value `k` is odd or when the length `n` is odd and the maximum possible Manhattan value is less than `k`.

Here is an example where the program fails:

For the input:
```
5 12
```

The program should output a permutation of length 5 with a Manhattan value of 12. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly. The function `func_2` returns `(n, k)` where `n` is the length and `k` is the required Manhattan value. In this case, `func_2` returns `(5, 12)`, which seems valid. However, the function `func_1` is designed to handle even `n` and may not correctly generate a permutation for odd `n` with the given `k`.

A correct approach would involve generating permutations that meet the required Manhattan value for both even and odd lengths. The current implementation does not account for these edge cases, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
