You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if k == 0:
            return l
        if 1 + i > k:
            x = l[-1]
            l.pop(-1)
            l.insert(-k, x)
            return l
        k = k - i + 1
        x = l[-1]
        l.pop(-1)
        l.insert(0, x)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if k % 2:
        return (0, 0)
    if n % 2:
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else:
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    if max_k < k:
        return (0, 0)
    return (n, k)

#Function 3:
def func_3(l):
    print('YES')
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    return

#Function 4:
def func_4():
    (n, k) = func_2()
    if n == 0:
        print('NO')
        return
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_3(l)
    return



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function accepts no parameters and returns either `None` or the result of calling `func_3(l)`, where `l` is the result of the function call `func_1(n, k)`. If `n` is 0, the function prints 'NO' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it proceeds to call `func_1(n, k)` with the given constraints on `n` and `k`, then calls `func_3(l)` with the result of `func_1(n, k)`, and returns the result of this call.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \).
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).

2. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function checks if \( k \) is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \).
   - If \( k \) is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` because an even number cannot be achieved.
   - If \( n \) is odd, the maximum Manhattan value is \(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\).
   - If \( n \) is even, the maximum Manhattan value is \(\frac{n^2}{2}\).
   - If \( k \) exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value, it returns `(0, 0)`.

3. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function constructs a permutation based on the given \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It initializes a list `l` with numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It iteratively moves elements to the front or back of the list to adjust the Manhattan value until it reaches \( k \).

4. **Analyzing `func_3`:**
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation and ends with a newline.

5. **Analyzing `func_4`:**
   - This function calls `func_2` to check if a valid permutation exists.
   - If `func_2` returns `(0, 0)`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to construct the permutation and then `func_3` to print the result.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code correctly handles edge cases where \( k \) is odd or when \( k \) exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value.
   - The construction logic in `func_1` ensures that the Manhattan value matches \( k \) by moving elements appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem. It checks for the feasibility of constructing a permutation with the required Manhattan value and constructs one if possible. The functions handle all specified conditions and edge cases appropriately.
