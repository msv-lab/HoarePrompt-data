Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function.
2. The function processes each test case as required by the problem statement.
3. It calculates the sequence \( L \) by repeatedly halving \( n \) (rounded up) until \( n \) becomes zero.
4. It then determines the position where \( k \) falls within the cumulative sum of elements in \( L \).
5. Finally, it computes and prints the \( k \)-th card based on the position found.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the function appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
