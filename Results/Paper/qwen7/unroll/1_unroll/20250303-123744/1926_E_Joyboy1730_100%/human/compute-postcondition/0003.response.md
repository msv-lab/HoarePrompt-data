Output State: The output state depends on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. For each test case defined by `t`, the loop processes pairs of integers `(n, k)` and prints a result based on the operations performed within the loop. Specifically, it calculates a sequence `L` where each element represents half of the current value of `n` rounded up, subtracts this value from `n`, and appends the result to `L`. Then, it iterates over `L` to find the position where `k` falls within the cumulative sum of elements in `L`, and prints a calculated value based on this position. The output consists of multiple lines, one for each pair `(n, k)` processed, representing the computed results.
