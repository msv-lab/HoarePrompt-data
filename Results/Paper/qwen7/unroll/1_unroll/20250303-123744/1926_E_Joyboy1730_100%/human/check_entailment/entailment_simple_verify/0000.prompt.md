You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        L = []
        
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)
        
        tot = 0
        
        pow = 1
        
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2
        
    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. For each test case defined by `t`, the loop processes pairs of integers `(n, k)` and prints a result based on the operations performed within the loop. Specifically, it calculates a sequence `L` where each element represents half of the current value of `n` rounded up, subtracts this value from `n`, and appends the result to `L`. Then, it iterates over `L` to find the position where `k` falls within the cumulative sum of elements in `L`, and prints a calculated value based on this position. The output consists of multiple lines, one for each pair `(n, k)` processed, representing the computed results.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the described process for laying down the cards. Specifically, the logic for determining which card to print based on the value of `k` is flawed. Let's consider the following example:

For the input:
```
7 4
```

According to the problem description, the sequence of cards laid down would be:
1. Odd-numbered cards: 1, 3, 5, 7
2. Cards that are twice an odd number: 2, 6
3. Cards that are three times an odd number: 6 (but there is only one 6, so no new card here)

So the sequence is: 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4.

However, the program incorrectly prints the 4th card as 7 instead of 4. This happens because the logic for determining the position within the current group of cards is incorrect. The program calculates the power of 2 (`pow`) and the number of cards in the current group (`m`), but it does not correctly map `k` to the correct card in the current group.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly map `k` to the card within the current group and ensure that it handles the groups in the correct order. The current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain values of `k`.
