Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and `t` is now set to the integer value of the input.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), after executing the code, `t` will still satisfy this condition, but its specific value will be the one entered by the user. All other conditions and constraints on `t` remain unchanged.
