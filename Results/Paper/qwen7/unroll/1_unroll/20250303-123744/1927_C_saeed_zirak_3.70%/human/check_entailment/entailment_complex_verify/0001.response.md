### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Variables Initialization**: The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are correctly initialized from the input. The variable `newk` is set to `k // 2`, which is also correct.

3. **Counters Initialization**: The counters `aOnes` and `bOnes` are initialized to zero. These counters are used to keep track of how many elements from each array have been chosen up to `i`.

4. **Loop Through Numbers from 1 to k**: The loop iterates through numbers from 1 to `k`. For each number `i`:
   - It checks if `i` exists in both arrays `a` and `b`.
   - If `i` exists in both arrays, it increments the counter of the array with fewer chosen elements (`aOnes` or `bOnes`).
   - If `i` exists in only one array, it increments the counter of that array if the count is less than or equal to `newk`.
   - If `i` does not exist in either array and the count of chosen elements from that array is already greater than `newk`, the loop breaks.

5. **Final Check**: After the loop, it checks if both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`. If they are, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the loop. Specifically, the loop only considers the first occurrence of each number `i` in the arrays `a` and `b`. This means that if a number `i` appears multiple times in either array, the function will only consider the first occurrence, which may lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  6 5 6
  2 3 8 5 6 5
  1 3 4 10 5
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

In this test case, the number `5` appears twice in array `a`, but the function only considers the first occurrence of `5` in both arrays. Therefore, the function incorrectly determines that it is not possible to choose exactly `3` elements from each array such that all numbers from 1 to 6 are included.

To fix this issue, the function needs to ensure that it can handle multiple occurrences of the same number in the arrays. One way to do this is to use sets to store the unique elements in each array and then check for the presence of each number from 1 to `k` in these sets.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = set(map(int, input().split()))
        b = set(map(int, input().split()))
        aOnes = 0
        bOnes = 0
        newk = k // 2
        i = 1
        while i <= k:
            if i in a and i in b:
                if aOnes < bOnes:
                    aOnes += 1
                else:
                    bOnes += 1
            elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
                aOnes += 1
            elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
                bOnes += 1
            else:
                break
            i += 1
        if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was inaccurate because the provided function does not correctly handle the case where a number appears multiple times in the arrays. The corrected function uses sets to ensure that all occurrences of each number are considered.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
