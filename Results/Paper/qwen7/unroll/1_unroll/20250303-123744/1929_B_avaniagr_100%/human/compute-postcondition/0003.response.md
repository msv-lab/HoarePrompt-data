Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes inputs through variables t, n, and k, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2. It returns a value based on the relationship between n and k.**

Note: The actual return value is not specified in the given information, only the constraints and relationships between the variables.
