Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 10^4 inclusive), and `s` (a string consisting of `n` characters 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the direction specified by `s`. Then, it calculates a list `ans` where each element is the product of all elements in `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`. Finally, it returns the reversed version of `ans`.**
