### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the highest page numbers from two non-empty piles of books.
2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of page numbers `nums`.
   - It then prints the sum of the maximum value from the first `n-1` elements and the last element of `nums`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided solution considers the sum of the maximum value from the first `n-1` elements and the last element of `nums`. This approach does not necessarily divide the books into two non-empty piles optimally.
   - For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, the solution would print `max([1, 2]) + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5`, but the optimal solution would be to split the books into `[1]` and `[2, 3]`, resulting in `2 + 3 = 5`.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To maximize the total number of pages read, we need to ensure that the division of books into two piles results in both piles being non-empty and the sums of the highest page numbers in each pile being maximized.
   - The current implementation does not guarantee this optimal division. It simply takes the maximum of the first `n-1` elements and adds the last element, which may not result in the best possible split.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the process of reading the input and printing the sum of the maximum value from the first `n-1` elements and the last element of `nums`.
   - However, the annotation does not mention the potential issue of not ensuring the non-empty division of books into two piles.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not guarantee the optimal division of books into two non-empty piles. It only ensures that the last element is included in one of the piles, but it does not ensure that the division is optimal.
