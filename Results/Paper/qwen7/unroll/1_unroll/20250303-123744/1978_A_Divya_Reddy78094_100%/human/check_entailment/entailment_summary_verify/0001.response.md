### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the highest page numbers from two non-empty piles of books.
   - The given solution attempts to achieve this by taking the maximum of the first \(n-1\) elements and adding the last element.

2. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` correctly processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of page numbers `nums`.
   - It then prints the sum of the maximum value from the first \(n-1\) elements and the last element of `nums`.

3. **Edge Case Analysis**:
   - The provided solution handles simple edge cases like `[1, 1]` and `[2, 3, 3, 1]` correctly.
   - However, the original assessment points out that the solution does not guarantee the optimal division of books into two non-empty piles. 

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To maximize the total number of pages read, we need to ensure that the division of books results in both piles being non-empty and optimally chosen.
   - The current implementation does not guarantee this optimal division. For example, if the input is `[2, 3, 3, 1]`, the solution prints `3 + 1 = 4`, but the optimal solution would be to divide the books such that one pile has `[3, 3]` and the other has `[2, 1]`, resulting in a total of `3 + 3 = 6`.

5. **Detailed Evaluation**:
   - Let's consider the example `nums = [2, 3, 3, 1]` again:
     - The current solution prints `max([2, 3, 3]) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.
     - The optimal solution would be to divide the books into piles `[3, 3]` and `[2, 1]`, resulting in a total of `3 + 3 = 6`.
   - Another example, `nums = [2, 2, 3, 2, 2]`:
     - The current solution prints `max([2, 2, 3, 2]) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5`.
     - The optimal solution would be to divide the books into piles `[3, 2, 2]` and `[2, 2]`, resulting in a total of `3 + 2 = 5`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not guarantee the optimal division of books into two non-empty piles. Therefore, it may not always produce the maximum total number of pages read.
