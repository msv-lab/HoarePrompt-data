Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `A` is a list containing integers where each element represents the cumulative sum of positions of '>' characters up to that point, adjusted by the number of intermediate '>' characters and their positions; `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in the string `s`; `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s`; `l` is 0.**

The variable `l` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
