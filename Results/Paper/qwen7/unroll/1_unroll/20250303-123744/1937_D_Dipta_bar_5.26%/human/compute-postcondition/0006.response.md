Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `A` is a list containing integers where each element represents the cumulative sum of positions of '>' characters up to that point, adjusted by the number of intermediate '>' characters and their positions; `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in the string `s`; `B` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `B`. This does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, `A`, or `idx_A`. Therefore, these variables retain their original states.
