### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The pinball's movement depends on the direction (`<` or `>`) at each cell, and the direction changes after each move.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the directions.
   - The function `func_1(s)` is defined to process the string `s`.

3. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - It calculates two arrays `A` and `B` which store the cumulative distances traveled by the pinball when it moves right and left respectively.
   - `A` array is built by iterating from left to right, and `B` array is built by iterating from right to left.
   - The logic for building these arrays seems to be correct as it accounts for the changing directions and the cumulative distances.
   - The main loop in `func_1(s)` then uses these arrays to compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting cell.

4. **Main Loop Logic**:
   - The main loop iterates through each cell and uses the precomputed arrays `A` and `B` to determine the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The logic for computing the time taken seems to correctly handle the changing directions and the cumulative distances.
   - However, there are several issues with the logic and calculations in the main loop:
     - The logic for updating `A` and `B` arrays is not consistent with the problem requirements.
     - The formulas used to compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid are overly complex and do not accurately reflect the movement and direction changes.
     - The handling of edge cases, such as when the pinball starts at the boundaries, is not correctly implemented.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code attempts to handle edge cases but does so in a manner that is not consistent with the problem requirements.
   - For example, the logic for determining the time taken when the pinball starts at the boundary cells is incorrect.

6. **Output**:
   - The output is not correctly formatted and does not match the expected output format provided in the example.

### Detailed Analysis of the Main Loop Logic:

- **Incorrect Calculation of Cumulative Distances**:
  - The arrays `A` and `B` are not correctly updated to reflect the cumulative distances traveled by the pinball.
  - The formulas used to update `A` and `B` are overly complex and do not accurately represent the movement of the pinball.

- **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**:
  - The logic for handling the pinball starting at the boundary cells is incorrect.
  - For example, when the pinball starts at the leftmost cell and encounters a `>` character, it should move right until it reaches the boundary, but the current logic does not correctly handle this scenario.

- **Incorrect Output Format**:
  - The output is not correctly formatted and does not match the expected output format provided in the example.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code, it appears that the logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is incorrect. The code does not correctly handle the movement and direction changes, and the output is not formatted correctly.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
