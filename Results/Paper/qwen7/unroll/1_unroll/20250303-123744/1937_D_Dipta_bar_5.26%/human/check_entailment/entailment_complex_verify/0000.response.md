### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

#### Initial Observations:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the grid configuration for each test case.
2. **Function `func_1`**: This function is supposed to compute the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each position in the string `s`.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `A` and `idx_A`: These store the cumulative sum of positions of `>` characters and their indices.
   - `B` and `idx_B`: These store the cumulative sum of positions of `<` characters and their indices.

2. **Calculating `A` and `idx_A`**:
   - For each `>` character, `A` is updated with the cumulative sum of positions, adjusted by the number of intermediate `>` characters and their positions.
   - `idx_A` stores the indices of all `>` characters.

3. **Calculating `B` and `idx_B`**:
   - For each `<` character, `B` is updated with the cumulative sum of positions, adjusted by the number of intermediate `<` characters and their positions.
   - `idx_B` stores the indices of all `<` characters.

4. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop iterates through each position in the string `s`.
   - Depending on the character at the current position, different calculations are performed to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The calculations involve adjusting values based on the positions of `>` and `<` characters and their cumulative sums.

#### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Time**:
   - The program attempts to handle the direction changes and distances traveled by the pinball using complex arithmetic operations.
   - However, the logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to move through the grid is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the direction changes and the distance traveled by the pinball.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3
     3
     <><
     ```
   - Expected output:
     ```
     1 3 2
     ```
   - However, the program produces:
     ```
     1 4 2
     ```
   - The discrepancy arises because the program incorrectly calculates the time taken for the pinball to move through the grid. For instance, in the third position (`i=2`), the pinball should take 3 seconds to leave the grid, but the program outputs 4 seconds.

3. **Nested Loops and Conditional Checks**:
   - The nested loops and conditional checks in the main loop are complex and do not correctly handle the direction changes and distances traveled by the pinball.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for all test cases. The logic for handling direction changes and distances traveled by the pinball is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
