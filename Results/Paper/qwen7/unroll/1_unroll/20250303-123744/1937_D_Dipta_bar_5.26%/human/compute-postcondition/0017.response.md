Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. It calculates and prints a series of numbers based on the positions and counts of '>' and '<' characters in the string. Specifically, it computes values involving cumulative sums of positions of '>' characters and differences between positions of '<' characters, then prints these values for each character in the string. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs a sequence of numbers derived from the input string.**
