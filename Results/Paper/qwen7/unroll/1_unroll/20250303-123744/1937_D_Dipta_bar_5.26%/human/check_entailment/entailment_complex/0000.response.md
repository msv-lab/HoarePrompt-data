Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The pinball moves according to the direction indicated by the character at its current position and reverses the direction after each move.

2. **Analyze the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string itself.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

3. **Breakdown of `func_1`**:
   - The function first computes the cumulative sum of positions of '>' characters (`A` and `idx_A`).
   - Then, it computes the cumulative sum of positions of '<' characters (`B` and `idx_B`).
   - Finally, it iterates through the string to compute the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - The logic for computing the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid seems to be implemented correctly. The function handles both '>' and '<' characters appropriately.
   - The function correctly accounts for the reversal of directions and the cumulative sums.
   - The function prints the results for each cell in the grid.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as the pinball starting from the boundary cells correctly.
   - The function also handles the case where there are no '>' or '<' characters in the string.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` correctly computes the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell, and the overall structure of the code is sound.

Correctness: **True**
