Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `range(0, n)`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - `n` is defined as the length of the string `s`. Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` until it reaches `n`, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to execute.
   - `i` starts at 0 and will increment in each iteration of the loop.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - `i` should start at 0.

Given the initial states:
- `r` is the length of `idx_B`.
- `s` is a string of length `n`.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `A` is a list containing integers where each element represents the cumulative sum of positions of '>' characters up to that point, adjusted by the number of intermediate '>' characters and their positions.
- `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in the string `s`.
- `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s`.
- `l` is 0.

The only variables that need adjustment for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
