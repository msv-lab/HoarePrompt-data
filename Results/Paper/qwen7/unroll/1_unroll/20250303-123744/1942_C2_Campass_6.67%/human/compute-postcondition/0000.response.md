Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` which takes input from the user and splits it into multiple integers, converting them to integers. This does not affect the value of `t` or the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` within each test case. The initial conditions for `t` remain unchanged, and the lambda function `R` is now defined and ready to be used for further input processing.
