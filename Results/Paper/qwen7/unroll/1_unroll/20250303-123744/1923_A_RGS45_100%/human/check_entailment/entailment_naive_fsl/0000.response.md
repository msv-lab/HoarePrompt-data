Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Specifically, the logic used to determine the positions of the first and last chips ('1') and the segment between them ('z') does not account for the requirement to move chips to the closest free cell to the left. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```

The program incorrectly finds `x` and `y` as the positions of the first and last '1', respectively, and calculates `z` as the segment between them. However, it fails to move the chip in the 7th position to the 5th position, which would be the correct operation to minimize the number of moves.

The correct approach would involve iterating through the array to count the number of free cells between consecutive chips and summing these counts to get the minimum number of operations needed.
