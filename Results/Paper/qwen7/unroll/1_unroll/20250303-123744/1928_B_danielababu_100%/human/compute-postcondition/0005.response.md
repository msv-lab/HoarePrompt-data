Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` where each element is the product of all elements from the end of `arr` to the current position, starting with the last element of `arr`**

This means that the program returns the list `ans` which is constructed by multiplying all elements from the end of the list `arr` to the current position, starting with the last element of `arr`. For example, if `arr = [2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `ans` would be `[120, 80, 40, 20]` because:
- The last element of `arr` is `5`, so the first element of `ans` is `5`.
- The second last element of `arr` is `4`, and when multiplied by the last element (`5`), it gives `20`.
- The third last element of `arr` is `3`, and when multiplied by the previous result (`20`), it gives `60`.
- The first element of `arr` is `2`, and when multiplied by the previous result (`60`), it gives `120`.

So, the final `ans` list would be `[120, 60, 20, 5]`.
