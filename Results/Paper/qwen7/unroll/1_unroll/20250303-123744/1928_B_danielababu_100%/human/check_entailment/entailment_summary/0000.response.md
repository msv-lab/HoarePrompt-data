Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum frequency of any number in the array after adding a permutation to the array. The solution involves sorting the unique elements of the array and then determining the maximum possible frequency of any number after the permutation.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_3()`: Reads the array elements for each test case and returns them as a list.
   - The code snippet provided uses `func_1()` to get the number of test cases, `func_3()` to get the array elements, and then processes these elements.
   - The core logic of the provided code snippet is to:
     - Sort the unique elements of the array.
     - Use binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the position where the next element would fit in the sorted list.
     - Calculate the difference between the current position and the position where the next element would fit to determine the potential increase in frequency.
     - Track the maximum frequency.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The code correctly identifies the unique elements of the array and sorts them.
   - It uses binary search to efficiently find positions and calculate differences.
   - The logic to update the maximum frequency is correct and follows the problem's requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided code snippet correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
