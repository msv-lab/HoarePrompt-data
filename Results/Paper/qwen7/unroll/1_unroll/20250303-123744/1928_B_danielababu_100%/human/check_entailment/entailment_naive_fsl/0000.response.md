Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions defined in the program do not perform any operations related to the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not:

1. Read the input as described in the problem.
2. Process the array and a permutation to maximize the frequency of a single number.
3. Output the result as specified in the problem.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
2
1 2
4
7 1 4 1
```

The expected output is:
```
2
2
```

However, the current implementation does not read the input or perform any relevant computations, thus it will not produce the correct output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
