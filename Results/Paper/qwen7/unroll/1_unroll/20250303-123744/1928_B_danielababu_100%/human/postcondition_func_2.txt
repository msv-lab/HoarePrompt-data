The function processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the length of the array `a`, followed by a space-separated list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. After processing all test cases, the function returns a list of integers entered by the user, corresponding to the space-separated list of integers for each test case.
