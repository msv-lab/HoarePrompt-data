Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects sorted by `balance` in ascending order and by `-position` in descending order within the same `balance`. `balance` is 0.**

Explanation: The code sorts the `balance_info` list based on two criteria: first by the `balance` attribute in ascending order, and second by the `-position` (which means position in descending order) within the same `balance` value. The length of the string `s` (`n`) and the initial `balance` value remain unchanged.
