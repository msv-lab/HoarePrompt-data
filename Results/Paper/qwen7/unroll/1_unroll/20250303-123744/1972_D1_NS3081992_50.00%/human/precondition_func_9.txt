There is no input parameter for the function, and it should read an integer t from the standard input, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it should read two integers n and m, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6, and the sum of n or m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6.
