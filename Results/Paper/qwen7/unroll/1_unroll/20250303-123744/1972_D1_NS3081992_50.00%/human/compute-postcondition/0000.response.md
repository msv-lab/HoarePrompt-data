Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6 and they are the return values of `func_7()`**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = func_7()` calls the function `func_7()`, which returns two values (presumably `n` and `m`). These returned values replace the previous values of `n` and `m`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^6, the output state reflects that these conditions still hold true, but now `n` and `m` specifically refer to the values returned by `func_7()`.
