Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `i` is 1.**

The code initializes the variable `i` to 1. Since `n` and `m` are the return values of `func_7()` and their values are unchanged, they remain as positive integers within the specified range. The variable `i` is now set to 1.
