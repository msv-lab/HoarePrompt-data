The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of length `max(da)` containing only 0s and 1s, an integer `da`, and a list `rank` of length `max(da)` initialized with zeros. It returns either 1 or the value of `rank[da - 1]`, which is `tmp + 1`. If the length of `d[da]` is 1, the function immediately returns 1. Otherwise, it updates the `processing` list temporarily to mark nodes as processed and recursively calculates the minimum value of `rank[da - 1]` for each node in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is initially 0. Finally, it sets `rank[da - 1]` to this minimum value plus one and returns this value.
