    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i's are distinct; after executing the loop, ans and ans1 are integers representing the maximum value between the two computed values in the loop for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t`, where `t` represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `s` of `n` distinct integers. It then swaps the first element of the list with the element at index `k-1`. After performing some comparisons and counting operations, it calculates two values, `ans` and `ans1`, and prints the maximum of these two values for each test case. The final output consists of `t` lines, each containing the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` for the corresponding test case.
