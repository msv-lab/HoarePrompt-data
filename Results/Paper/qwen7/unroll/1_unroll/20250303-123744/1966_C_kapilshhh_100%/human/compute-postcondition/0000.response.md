Output State: **`tc` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases, and all other variables are unchanged.**

The code `tc = int(input())` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases (`tc`). This value is stored in the variable `tc`. Since no other variables are mentioned or modified in the given code snippet, the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.
