The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `a` and `b`, both of which must satisfy 0 <= a, b < n. It prints the values of `a` and `b` in a formatted string and flushes the output buffer to ensure the print statement is executed immediately. The function does not return any value.
