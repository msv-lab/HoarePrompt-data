Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each string to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The list `a` is updated to `arr`, which contains the integers read from the input.
