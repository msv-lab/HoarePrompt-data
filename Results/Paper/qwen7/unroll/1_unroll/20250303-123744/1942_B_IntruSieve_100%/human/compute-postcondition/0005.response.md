State: **`minn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is an empty list, `used` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 before entering the loop.
- The loop will iterate over the range `range(n)`, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.
- All other variables (`minn`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `mex`, `used`) are not directly involved in the loop condition or initialization and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i`, which should be set to 0.
