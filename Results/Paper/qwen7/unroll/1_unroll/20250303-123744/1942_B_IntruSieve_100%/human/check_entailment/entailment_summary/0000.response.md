Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).
2. The provided code does not actually construct the permutation \( p \). Instead, it calculates a sequence \( \text{mex} \), which is not directly related to the problem's requirements.
3. The function `func_1()` processes the array \( a \) and constructs a list `mex`, but this list does not represent the desired permutation \( p \).
4. The logic inside the loop for calculating `mex` does not correctly reflect the MEX operation as defined in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not ensure that the MEX is correctly computed for each position in the permutation.

Given these points, the provided code does not solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
