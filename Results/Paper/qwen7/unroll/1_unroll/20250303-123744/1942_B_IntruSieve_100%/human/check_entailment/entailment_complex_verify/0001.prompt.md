You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n; there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True

                minn += 1

            used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
        
    #State: `minn` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `a`, `mex` is a list containing elements that are increments of `minn` based on conditions in the loop, `used` is a dictionary marking integers that have been used according to the loop logic.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: The loop prints each element in the list `mex` separated by a space.
    print()
    #This is printed: an empty line
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` and prints a sequence of integers `mex`. For each element in `a`, if the element is positive, `mex` contains the smallest non-negative integer not present in `a` up to that point. If the element is negative, `mex` contains the smallest non-negative integer that would make the element non-negative when subtracted from it. The function does not return any value but prints the sequence `mex` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).
   - Each element \( a_i \) is defined as \( \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the size of the permutation \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the MEX values.
   - It uses a dictionary `used` to keep track of which numbers have been used.
   - It iterates through the array \( a \):
     - If \( a_i \) is positive, it calculates the MEX up to \( i \) and appends it to `mex`.
     - If \( a_i \) is negative, it calculates the MEX adjusted by the absolute value of \( a_i \) and appends it to `mex`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating MEX seems correct. However, we need to ensure that the permutation \( p \) is correctly constructed.
   - The code does not explicitly construct the permutation \( p \). Instead, it constructs the MEX values directly.

4. **Constructing the Permutation \( p \):**
   - To construct \( p \), we need to ensure that the MEX values match the conditions specified by \( a \).
   - The current implementation only calculates the MEX values but does not ensure that the resulting permutation \( p \) satisfies the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - Let's analyze the example provided:
     - For the input `[1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`, the function outputs `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.
     - This output does not satisfy the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \) for all \( i \).

6. **Correct Implementation:**
   - A correct implementation would involve constructing \( p \) such that the MEX values match the given \( a \).
   - The current implementation does not do this.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
