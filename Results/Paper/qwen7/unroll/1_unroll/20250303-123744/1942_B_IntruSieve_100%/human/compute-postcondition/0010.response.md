Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies a set of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t`, a positive integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function returns a valid permutation `p` of the list `a` where the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing a value `t`, an integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function then generates and returns a valid permutation `p` of the list `a` for each test case, ensuring that the total count of integers across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
