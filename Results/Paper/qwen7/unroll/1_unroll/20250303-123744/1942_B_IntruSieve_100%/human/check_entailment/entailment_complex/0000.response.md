Reasoning:

The provided program does not actually solve the problem as described. The function `func_1()` does not construct a permutation `p` based on the array `a` as required. Instead, it generates a list `mex` which does not correspond to the MEX values of the hypothetical permutation `p`. 

To correctly solve the problem, the function should generate a permutation `p` such that for each index `i`, `a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i`. The current implementation does not achieve this goal.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
