t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; a is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ a_i ≤ n; and there exists at least one valid permutation p for the given a. Additionally, the sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
