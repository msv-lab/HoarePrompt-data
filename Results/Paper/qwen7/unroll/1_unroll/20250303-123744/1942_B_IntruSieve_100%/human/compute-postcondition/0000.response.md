Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds a positive integer within the specified range. The list `a` is not modified by this code.
