Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the query point `d` falls exactly between two known points. Specifically, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the position `s` where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`. If `a[s]` is not equal to `ql`, it calculates the time based on the speed between `a[s-1]` and `a[s]`. However, this approach assumes that `ql` is strictly between `a[s-1]` and `a[s]`, which is not always true. For instance, if `ql` is exactly equal to `a[s]`, the program incorrectly calculates the time without considering the exact position.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

```
Input:
1
10 1 1
10
10
5
```

Expected output:
```
5
```

However, the program's output is:
```
4
```

This happens because the program does not account for the exact match scenario. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
