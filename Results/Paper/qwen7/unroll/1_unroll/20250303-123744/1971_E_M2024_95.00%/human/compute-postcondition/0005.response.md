Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a range of values defined by lists `a` and `b`, and answers `q` queries for each test case. For each query, it calculates an interpolated value based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, and prints the result. The function repeats this process for each of the `t` test cases.**
