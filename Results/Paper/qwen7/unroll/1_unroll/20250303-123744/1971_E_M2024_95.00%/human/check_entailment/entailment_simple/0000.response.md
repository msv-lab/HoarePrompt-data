Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input values for the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`.
2. It initializes lists `a` and `b` with the known points and times, respectively.
3. It calculates the distances between consecutive points in `a` and the corresponding speeds (time differences between consecutive times in `b`).
4. For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment of the journey where the queried point `ql` lies.
5. If the queried point exactly matches one of the known points, it directly outputs the corresponding time.
6. Otherwise, it interpolates the time for the queried point using the calculated speeds and distances.
7. The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Given this analysis, the program appears to follow the logic required to solve the problem accurately.

Correctness: **True**
