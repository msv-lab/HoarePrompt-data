Output State: **The program returns the number of test cases 't', along with a list of constraints for each test case. Each constraint is represented by two integers 'a' and 'x', where 'a' is either 1, 2, or 3, and 'x' is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\). There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.**

This output state describes that the program returns the total number of test cases (`t`) and for each test case, it returns a list of constraints. Each constraint includes an integer `a` which can be 1, 2, or 3, and an integer `x` which ranges from 1 to \(10^9\). It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and all constraints are unique.
