The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `space` and `to_int`. It processes an input line based on the `space` parameter, splitting it into a list of strings or converting it into a list of characters. Depending on the `to_int` parameter, it either converts the list elements into integers and returns them, or it returns the number of test cases `t` along with a list of constraints for each test case. Each constraint is represented by two integers `a` and `x`, where `a` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `x` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\). There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
