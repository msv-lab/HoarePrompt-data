The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `sym`, which is a string representing the separator between the integers when converting the list to a string. After executing the function body, it returns a concatenated string of all integers in `arr`, with each integer separated by the string `sym`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a string `sym`. It returns a concatenated string of all integers in `arr`, with each integer separated by `sym`.**
