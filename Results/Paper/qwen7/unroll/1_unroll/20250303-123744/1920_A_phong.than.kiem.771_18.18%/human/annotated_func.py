        #The program returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is `True`, it returns an integer input by the user. If `isOne` is `False`, it returns the integer `1`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of n constraints where n is an integer. Each constraint is represented by two integers a and x, where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is an integer between 1 and 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.

There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same. If the `space` condition is true, `items` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input `line` on spaces. Otherwise, `line` is converted into a list of characters, and the `space` condition is false.

Each constraint is represented by two integers 'a' and 'x', where 'a' is either 1, 2, or 3, and 'x' is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\). There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `space` and `to_int`. It processes an input line based on the `space` parameter, splitting it into a list of strings or converting it into a list of characters. Depending on the `to_int` parameter, it either converts the list elements into integers and returns them, or it returns the number of test cases `t` along with a list of constraints for each test case. Each constraint is represented by two integers `a` and `x`, where `a` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `x` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\). There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.

    #The program returns the concatenation of all integers in `arr` separated by `sym`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a string `sym`. It concatenates all integers in `arr`, separating them with `sym`, and returns the resulting string.
