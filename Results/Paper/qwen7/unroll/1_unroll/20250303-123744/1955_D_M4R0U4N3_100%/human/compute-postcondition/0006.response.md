Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes integers t, n, m, k, a (a list of n integers), and b (a list of m integers). For each test case, it counts the number of valid subarrays in a that contain at least k elements also present in b. It prints the count for each test case and resets the count array cnt_b to zero after processing each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
