Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros.

Explanation: The loop processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it updates the `cnt_b` list based on the input arrays `a` and `b`, calculates the value of `ans`, and then resets `cnt_b` to zero for the next iteration. After all iterations of the loop are completed, the `cnt_b` list is reset to zero for every test case, so it remains a list of 1000001 zeros. The values of `t` and `max_val` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
