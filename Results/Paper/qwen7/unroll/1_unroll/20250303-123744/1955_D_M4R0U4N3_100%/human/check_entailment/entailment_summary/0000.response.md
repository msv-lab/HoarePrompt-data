Reasoning:

1. The provided program correctly processes multiple test cases as specified.
2. It initializes a counter `cnt_b` to keep track of the frequency of elements in `b`.
3. For each test case, it calculates the number of subarrays in `a` that contain at least `k` elements from `b` by maintaining a sliding window approach.
4. The sliding window technique is used efficiently to update the count of elements in the current window and check if the condition (at least `k` elements from `b`) is satisfied.
5. The program correctly updates the count of elements in the sliding window and resets the counters for each new test case.
6. The logic for updating the current count (`curr`) and checking if the condition is met is accurate.
7. The program prints the result for each test case as required.

Given the above points, the program appears to implement the solution correctly according to the problem statement and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
