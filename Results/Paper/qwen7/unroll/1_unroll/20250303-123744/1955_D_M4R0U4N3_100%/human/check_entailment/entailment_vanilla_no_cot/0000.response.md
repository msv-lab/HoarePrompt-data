Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Initialization of `cnt_b`**: The size of `cnt_b` is fixed to `max_val + 1`, which is set to `1000000`. This is unnecessarily large and could lead to memory issues if the actual maximum value in the input is much smaller. It should be initialized with the actual maximum value found in the input.

2. **Handling of Test Cases**: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It processes all test cases in a single loop without resetting the necessary variables for each new test case.

3. **Logic for Counting Good Subsegments**: The logic for counting good subsegments is flawed. Specifically, the way `curr` is updated and the condition for incrementing `ans` is incorrect. The current implementation does not properly account for the sliding window approach needed to evaluate each subsegment.

4. **Resetting `cnt_b`**: The reset of `cnt_b` inside the loop is unnecessary and incorrect. It should be reset only once per test case, not after processing each subsegment.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    from collections import Counter

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Count occurrences of elements in b
        cnt_b = Counter(b)

        ans = 0
        curr = 0
        for i in range(m):
            if a[i] in cnt_b:
                cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1

        if curr >= k:
            ans += 1

        for i in range(n - m):
            if a[i] in cnt_b:
                cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
                    curr -= 1
            if a[i + m] in cnt_b:
                cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1

            if curr >= k:
                ans += 1

        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles multiple test cases and correctly counts the number of good subsegments using a sliding window approach.
