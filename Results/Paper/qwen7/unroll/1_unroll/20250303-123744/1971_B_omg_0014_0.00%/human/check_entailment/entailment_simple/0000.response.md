Reasoning:

1. The function `func()` processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the string `s`.
3. It then checks if the set of characters in `s` has a length of 2. If so, it correctly prints "NO" because there are no other unique permutations possible.
4. If the set length is not 2, it prints "YES" and then generates two potential rearrangements of the string `s`: one sorted in ascending order (`b`) and one sorted in descending order (`c`).
5. It then checks if the sorted string in ascending order (`b`) is the same as the original string `s`. If it is, it prints the sorted string in descending order (`c`); otherwise, it prints the sorted string in ascending order (`b`).

Given this logic, the program correctly handles the constraints and requirements of the problem. It correctly identifies when no valid rearrangement exists (if the string has exactly two unique characters) and provides a valid rearrangement when possible.

Correctness: **True**
