cities is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order (i.e., 0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1]), n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, where m represents the number of queries. Each query consists of two distinct integers x and y (1 <= x, y <= n) indicating the cities to travel between.
