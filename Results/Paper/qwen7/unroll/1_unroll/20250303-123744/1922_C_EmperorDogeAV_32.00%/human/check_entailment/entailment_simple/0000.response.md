Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities, where you can either travel directly to another city at a cost equal to the distance between the two cities or travel to the closest city at a cost of 1 coin.

2. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of city coordinates, followed by queries asking for the minimum cost to travel between pairs of cities.
   - The `func_1` function is intended to compute a list indicating whether the next city is closer than the previous one, but there is an error in its logic.
   - The main part of the code calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward directions and uses these to answer the queries efficiently.

3. **Issues in `func_1`**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It incorrectly sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 if the distance to the next city is smaller, but it should actually store the minimum distance to the closest city.
   - The current implementation always sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1, which is incorrect because it does not reflect the actual closest city distances.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly identify the closest city, we need to store the index of the closest city for each city in the original list.
   - We can then use this information to compute the minimum cost efficiently.

Given these points, the provided solution is incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_1`.

Correctness: **False**
