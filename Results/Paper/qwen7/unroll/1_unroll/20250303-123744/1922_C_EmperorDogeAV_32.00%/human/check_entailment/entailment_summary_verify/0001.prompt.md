You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    5 1

Output

    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers `cities` representing the coordinates of \( n \) cities in ascending order and an integer \( n \) indicating the number of cities. After processing, it returns a list of \( n - 1 \) ones. Specifically, for each city except the first and last, it checks the distance to the next city versus the previous city. If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets the corresponding position in the output list to 1; otherwise, it sets it to the absolute difference in coordinates, which will always be greater than 1 given the problem constraints. Since the cities are in ascending order, the distance to the next city is always less, resulting in all positions in the output list being set to 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum cost to travel between two cities.
   - The cost of moving to the closest city is 1 coin.
   - Moving to any other city costs the absolute difference in their positions.

2. **Key Components:**
   - `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`: These arrays store the distances to the next and previous closest cities, respectively.
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`: These are prefix sums of the `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` arrays, used to quickly calculate the sum of distances between two indices.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the distances to the next closest city for each city.
   - It iterates through each city and checks the distances to the previous and next cities.
   - If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets the value to 1 (indicating the next city is the closest).
   - Otherwise, it sets the value to the distance to the next city.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main loop processes each query.
   - It uses the prefix sums to quickly calculate the total distance between the two cities.
   - If the starting city index is less than the ending city index, it uses `pref_sum_f`.
   - Otherwise, it uses `pref_sum_b`.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function `func_1` should correctly identify the closest city for each city.
   - The logic for calculating the prefix sums and using them to answer queries seems correct.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the handling of the closest city distances. The code assumes that the closest city is always the next city, which might not be true for all cases.

6. **Testing the Function:**
   - Let's test the function with the provided example:
     - Cities: `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`
     - Expected closest city distances: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` (since the closest city is always the next one).

7. **Verification:**
   - Running the function with the example data:
     - `func_1([0, 8, 12, 15, 20], 5)` returns `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, which is incorrect because the closest city for the last city should be the previous one.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` does not correctly identify the closest city for each city. Therefore, the overall solution is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
