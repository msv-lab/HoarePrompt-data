### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Input Parsing:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities, and the number of queries `m`.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function aims to determine the direction (forward or backward) to move towards the closest city.
- It initializes `prog_cities` as a list of zeros of length `n-1`.
- For each city (except the first and last), it calculates the distances to the previous and next cities.
- If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1, indicating a forward move.
- Otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the absolute difference in coordinates, which will always be larger than 1 based on the problem constraints.

#### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Closest City**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly identify the closest city for each position. It only checks the distance to the next and previous cities, but it does not ensure that the closest city is unique and correctly identified.
   - The logic in `func_1` does not account for the fact that the closest city might be either the next or the previous city, depending on their relative positions.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Prefix Sums**:
   - The program calculates prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` using the values returned by `func_1`. However, since `func_1` does not correctly identify the closest city, the prefix sums are also incorrect.
   - The prefix sums are used to determine the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities, but they are based on incorrect assumptions about the closest city.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - The program handles the queries by printing the difference in prefix sums. However, since the prefix sums are based on incorrect data, the results are also incorrect.

#### Example Analysis:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  5
  0 8 12 15 20
  5
  1 4
  1 5
  3 4
  3 2
  5 1
  ```

- The expected output should be:
  ```
  3
  8
  1
  4
  14
  ```

- However, due to the incorrect logic in `func_1`, the program will not produce these results. The `func_1` function will incorrectly set `prog_cities` to all ones, leading to incorrect prefix sums and thus incorrect results for the queries.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the closest city, and the results are incorrect due to the flawed implementation of `func_1`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
