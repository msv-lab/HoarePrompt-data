Output State: `cities` is a list of integers representing the coordinates of n cities in ascending order, and `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` ones.

Explanation: The loop iterates through each city (except the first and last) and checks whether the next city is closer than the previous city. If the next city is closer, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1, indicating a forward direction. If not, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the absolute difference between the next and current city, but since the condition for setting it to 1 is met only when the next city is closer, `prog_cities[i]` will predominantly be 1s. Given the structure of the loop and the conditions, `prog_cities` will end up being a list of `n - 1` ones.
