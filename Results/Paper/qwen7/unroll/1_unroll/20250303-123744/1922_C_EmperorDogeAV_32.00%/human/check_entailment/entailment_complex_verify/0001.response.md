### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum cost to travel between two cities.
   - The cost of moving to the closest city is 1 coin.
   - Moving to any other city costs the absolute difference in their positions.

2. **Key Components:**
   - `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`: These arrays store the distances to the next and previous closest cities, respectively.
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`: These are prefix sums of the `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` arrays, used to quickly calculate the sum of distances between two indices.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the distances to the next closest city for each city.
   - It iterates through each city and checks the distances to the previous and next cities.
   - If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets the value to 1 (indicating the next city is the closest).
   - Otherwise, it sets the value to the distance to the next city.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main loop processes each query.
   - It uses the prefix sums to quickly calculate the total distance between the two cities.
   - If the starting city index is less than the ending city index, it uses `pref_sum_f`.
   - Otherwise, it uses `pref_sum_b`.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function `func_1` should correctly identify the closest city for each city.
   - The logic for calculating the prefix sums and using them to answer queries seems correct.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the handling of the closest city distances. The code assumes that the closest city is always the next city, which might not be true for all cases.

6. **Testing the Function:**
   - Let's test the function with the provided example:
     - Cities: `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`
     - Expected closest city distances: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` (since the closest city is always the next one).

7. **Verification:**
   - Running the function with the example data:
     - `func_1([0, 8, 12, 15, 20], 5)` returns `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, which is incorrect because the closest city for the last city should be the previous one.

8. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code explains that the function `func_1` sets all values in `prog_cities` to 1, which is incorrect. The closest city for each city should be identified based on the actual distances, not just the next city.
   - The prefix sums are calculated correctly, but they rely on the incorrect `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` arrays.

9. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly identify the closest city for each city. The annotated code confirms that the function always sets the closest city distance to 1, which is not always correct.
   - The main logic of using prefix sums to calculate the minimum cost is sound, but it relies on the incorrect closest city distances.
