Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution contains several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**: The `func_1` function is intended to find the closest city for each city, but its logic is flawed. It incorrectly calculates the distances and does not ensure that the closest city is uniquely identified as per the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect Use of Prefix Sums**: The prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) are calculated based on the incorrect values from `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`. These arrays should store the indices of the closest cities, but they are instead storing some arbitrary values.

3. **Query Processing Logic**: The logic for processing queries assumes that the prefix sums contain the correct information about the closest cities, which is not the case due to the previous issues.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
- Identify the closest city for each city.
- Use these closest cities to compute the minimum cost for each query.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Find the closest city for each city
    closest_cities = [-1] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            closest_cities[i] = 1
        elif i == n - 1:
            closest_cities[i] = n - 2
        else:
            if cities[i + 1] - cities[i] <= cities[i] - cities[i - 1]:
                closest_cities[i] = i + 1
            else:
                closest_cities[i] = i - 1
    
    m = int(input())
    for _ in range(m):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        a -= 1
        b -= 1
        
        # Calculate the minimum cost using the closest cities
        if a < b:
            cost = 1 + min(abs(cities[b] - cities[closest_cities[b]]), abs(cities[b] - cities[a]))
        else:
            cost = 1 + min(abs(cities[a] - cities[closest_cities[a]]), abs(cities[a] - cities[b]))
        
        print(cost)
```

This corrected solution ensures that the closest city for each city is correctly identified and uses this information to compute the minimum cost for each query.
