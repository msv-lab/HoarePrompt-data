State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will run `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute even once.
3. The variable `_` is a placeholder used in Python when the loop variable is not needed. It is not necessary to adjust its state since it is not used outside the loop.
4. The variable `results` is mentioned in the problem statement, but its state (being an empty list) is already correct for the loop to execute. The loop does not modify `results` directly, so no adjustment is needed for `results`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is greater than 0.
