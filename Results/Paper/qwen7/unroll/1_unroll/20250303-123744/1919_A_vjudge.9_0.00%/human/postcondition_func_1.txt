The function processes a specified number of test cases, where each test case consists of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calls another function `func_1(a, b)` to determine the result. It collects these results in a list and then prints each result. The function does not modify the input integer \(t\) (the number of test cases) and ensures that the final output is a list of results corresponding to each test case.
