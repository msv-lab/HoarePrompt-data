### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns removing one coin from their respective wallets.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., a wallet with zero or fewer coins) loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Analyzing the Strategy**:
   - If both players play optimally, the key observation is that the game essentially boils down to the parity (odd/even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets.
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. For example, if Alice removes a coin from her wallet, Bob can remove a coin from his wallet, ensuring that the sum remains even until the end. This strategy ensures Bob wins.
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd, Alice can always ensure that the sum becomes even after her move, forcing Bob into a losing position. This strategy ensures Alice wins.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd using `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob', indicating Bob wins.
   - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice', indicating Alice wins.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

Given the analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description.

### Final Answer:
