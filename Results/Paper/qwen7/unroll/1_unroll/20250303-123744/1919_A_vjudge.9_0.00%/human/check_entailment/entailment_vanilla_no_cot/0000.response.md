Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The given solution correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the parity (even or odd nature) of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Hereâ€™s why it works:

1. **Game Dynamics**: 
   - Each player can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet.
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., when they have no coins left).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by mirroring her moves. This means that if Alice removes a coin, Bob can swap wallets to leave Alice with fewer coins.
   - Conversely, if the sum is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by ensuring she is never the one left with no coins.

3. **Implementation**:
   - `func_1` checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If it is, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using `func_1`, printing the result for each.

Given these points, the provided solution correctly identifies the winner for each test case based on the game rules and the parity check. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
