Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the loop condition.
   - The loop iterates over the range from `1` to `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is set to `1`.
   - The value of `n` should be such that the loop can execute at least once (i.e., `n` must be at least 1).

Given these points, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
- `i` must be `1`.
- `n` must be at least `1`.

Since the initial state already mentions `n` is an input integer between 2 and 24, this condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1**
