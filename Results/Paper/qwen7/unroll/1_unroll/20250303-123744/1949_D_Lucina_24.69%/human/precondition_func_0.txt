n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, where the j-th character of the i-th line represents the transition video between the i-th and the j-th scenarios. This character can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (no transition video needed when i = j). It is guaranteed that at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided (i.e., at most 2 \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input are 'F' or 'S').
