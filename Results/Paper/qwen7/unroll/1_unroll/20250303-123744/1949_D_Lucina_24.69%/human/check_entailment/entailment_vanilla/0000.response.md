### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires generating a complete transition video plan for a game with \( n \) scenarios.
   - The plan should ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type appear for any permutation of the scenarios.
   - The input provides a partially filled transition video plan with some undecided values ('?') and some already decided values ('F' for funny, 'S' for scary).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the input and initializes arrays `a` and `b` to count the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each scenario.
   - It iterates through the input to populate these counts.
   - It then separates scenarios into two lists (`sa` and `sb`) based on whether they have more 'F' or 'S' transitions.
   - If the list `sa` is longer or equal to `sb`, it tries to fill the undecided '?' values such that the first \(\frac{n}{4}\) scenarios are mostly 'F'.
   - Otherwise, it tries to fill the undecided '?' values such that the first \(\frac{n}{4}\) scenarios are mostly 'S'.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic seems to handle the separation of scenarios correctly based on the counts of 'F' and 'S'.
   - However, the code does not fully address the constraint of ensuring no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive 'F' or 'S' transitions for any permutation of the scenarios.
   - The code only ensures the first \(\frac{n}{4}\) scenarios are mostly 'F' or 'S', which might not be sufficient to meet the overall constraint for all permutations.

4. **Testing with Examples:**
   - For the first example (n = 5), the code generates a valid output, but it does not fully validate if the generated plan meets the constraint for all permutations.
   - For the second example (n = 12), the code also generates a valid output, but again, it does not fully validate the constraint for all permutations.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The code does not fully implement the required logic to ensure the constraint is met for all permutations of scenarios.
   - The code only handles a simplified case where the first \(\frac{n}{4}\) scenarios are mostly 'F' or 'S', which is insufficient to guarantee the constraint for all possible permutations.
