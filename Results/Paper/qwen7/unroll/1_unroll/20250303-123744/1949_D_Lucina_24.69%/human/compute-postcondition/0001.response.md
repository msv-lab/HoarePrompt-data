Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. Since `n` is an input integer between 2 and 24, the length of the list `a` will be between 3 and 25, inclusive, with all elements being 0.
