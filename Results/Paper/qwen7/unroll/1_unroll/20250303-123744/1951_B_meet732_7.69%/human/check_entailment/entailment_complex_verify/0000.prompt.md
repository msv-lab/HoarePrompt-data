You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `a` of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of `n` cows and an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n. It identifies indices of at most two elements in `a` that are greater than the `k`-th element of `a`. Based on specific conditions, it returns one of the following values: `n - 1`, `13`, a value that is 1 less than the first index of a greater element (if it is greater than 14), the maximum difference between `k` and the first index of a greater element or between the first index and 1, the minimum value between the second index of a greater element minus 1 and 13, the maximum difference between the first and second index of greater elements, or the maximum difference between the first index and `k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle all potential cases correctly. Here is an example where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3
6 5
7 2 727 10 12 13
```

According to the problem description, the optimal strategy involves finding the best position to swap the cow with index `k` to maximize the number of wins. However, the current implementation does not consider all possible swaps and their outcomes.

Let's analyze the provided example:
- The input is `6 5`, meaning there are 6 cows and we want to maximize the wins for cow 5.
- The ratings are `[7, 2, 727, 10, 12, 13]`.

The program attempts to find the first two positions with ratings greater than the cow at position `k`. However, it does not consider the possibility of swapping the cow at position `k` with other cows to potentially win more matches.

For instance, in this case, the cow at position 5 (rating 12) can be swapped with the cow at position 3 (rating 727) to potentially win more matches. The optimal strategy would involve checking all possible swaps and determining the best one.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:
- Swap the cow at position 5 with the cow at position 3.
- After the swap, the sequence becomes `[7, 2, 12, 10, 727, 13]`.
- Cow 5 (now at position 3) wins the first match against cow 2.
- Cow 5 then wins the second match against cow 10.
- Cow 5 then loses the third match against cow 727.

Thus, the cow at position 5 can win 2 matches by swapping with the cow at position 3, but the provided program does not account for this scenario.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
