You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; n is a positive even integer representing the number of columns in the grid; row1 is a string of length n containing only '<' and '>' characters representing the first row of the grid; row2 is a string of length n containing only '<' and '>' characters representing the second row of the grid.
def func_2():
    """
    读取输入并处理每个测试用例。
    """
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        row1 = input()
        
        row2 = input()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, row1, row2))
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_1(n, row1, row2)` with the respective inputs from each iteration of the loop. Each iteration reads an integer `n`, followed by two strings `row1` and `row2`, and appends the result of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` to the `results` list.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: the results of calling func_1(n, row1, row2) for each iteration, each result on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: t (a positive integer representing the number of test cases), n (a positive even integer representing the number of columns in the grid), row1 (a string of length n containing only '<' and '>' characters representing the first row of the grid), and row2 (a string of length n containing only '<' and '>' characters representing the second row of the grid). The function returns a result based on the comparison of row1 and row2 according to the given rules.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
