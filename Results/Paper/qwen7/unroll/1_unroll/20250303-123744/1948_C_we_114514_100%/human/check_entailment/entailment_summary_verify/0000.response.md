### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the function summaries to understand why the original assessment might be incorrect.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:

1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by examining the arrows in the grid.
   - It iterates through the first half of the grid (up to `half_n - 1`).
   - If an arrow in the first row points left (`<`) and the corresponding arrows in the second row point left (`<`), the function returns 'No'.
   - It also checks the last column separately to ensure the robot can move down from the last column of the first row to the last column of the second row.

2. **Flaws in the Logic**:
   - The function only checks if the robot can move left and then immediately move back due to left-pointing arrows. However, it does not check if the robot can move right and then follow the arrows to reach the last column.
   - The function does not consider the possibility of the robot moving right and then following the arrows to reach the last column of the second row.

#### Example Counter-Case:

Consider the input:
```
4
><>>
<<>
```

- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It moves right to (1, 2), and the arrow in (1, 2) points left, so it moves back to (1, 1).
- It then moves right again to (1, 2), and the arrow in (1, 2) points left, so it moves back to (1, 1).
- This cycle continues, and the robot cannot escape from the first row.

However, the function `func_1` does not account for this scenario and returns 'Yes' for this input. This is indeed a flaw in the logic of `func_1`.

#### Correct Approach:

To correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n), we need to ensure that the robot can move right and then follow the arrows to reach the last column of the second row. The function should check if there is a continuous path of right-moving arrows from the first row to the last column of the second row.

#### Corrected Function:

A corrected approach would involve checking if there is a continuous sequence of right-moving arrows in the first row that leads to the last column of the second row. Here is a revised version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, row1, row2):
    """
    判断机器人是否能够从 (1,1) 到达 (2,n)。
    """
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if row1[i] == '>' and row2[i] == '>':
            continue
        else:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'
```

This function checks if there is a continuous sequence of right-moving arrows from the first row to the last column of the second row.

#### Final Evaluation:

Given the analysis, the original assessment is correct. The provided `func_1` does not correctly handle all cases where the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final: **False**
