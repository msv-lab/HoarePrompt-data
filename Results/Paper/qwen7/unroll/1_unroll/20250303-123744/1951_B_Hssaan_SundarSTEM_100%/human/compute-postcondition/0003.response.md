Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a test case defined by the variables t, n, k, and a. It returns a result based on the conditions provided for these variables.**

- The function processes `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it takes `n` and `k` as integers where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`.
- It also takes a list `a` containing `n` distinct integers where `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`.

The function evaluates each test case according to the given constraints and returns a result for each one.
