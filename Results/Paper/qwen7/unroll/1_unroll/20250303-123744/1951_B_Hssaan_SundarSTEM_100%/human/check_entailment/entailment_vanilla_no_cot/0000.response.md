Let's analyze the provided solution to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Analysis

1. **Swapping Positions**:
   - The code swaps the positions of the cow at position `k` with the cow at position `1`. This is done twice:
     - Once before calculating `ans`.
     - Once before calculating `ans1`.

2. **Calculating Maximum Wins (`ans`)**:
   - After swapping, the code iterates through the list starting from the second element.
   - If the current cow's rating is greater than the highest rating seen so far (`h`), it breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it increments the count of wins (`ans`).

3. **Calculating Maximum Wins (`ans1`)**:
   - After swapping back, the code calculates the maximum wins again but this time considering the cow at position `p` (which is `j + 1`).
   - It checks if the cow at position `p` has the highest rating (`h`).
   - If the cow at position `0` is not `h`, it counts it as a win.
   - It then iterates through the list, counting wins until it encounters a cow with a higher rating than `h`.

### Issues in the Solution

1. **Incorrect Swapping**:
   - The code swaps the cow at position `k-1` with the cow at position `0` and then back, which might not be the optimal strategy. The optimal strategy should consider swapping the cow at position `k-1` with any other cow that could potentially increase the number of wins.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `ans1`**:
   - The logic for `ans1` is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that the cow at position `p` (which is `j + 1`) is the new starting point for counting wins, which may not be accurate.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Identify the cow with the highest rating.
2. Determine the best position to swap the cow at position `k-1` to maximize the number of wins.
3. Calculate the maximum wins based on the new position of the cow at `k-1`.

### Revised Solution

Here is a revised version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the cow with the highest rating
        max_rating = max(s)
        max_index = s.index(max_rating)
        
        # Determine the best position to swap
        if k - 1 == max_index:
            ans = 0
        else:
            # Swap the cow at position k-1 with the cow at max_index
            s[k-1], s[max_index] = s[max_index], s[k-1]
            
            # Calculate the maximum wins
            ans = 0
            h = s[0]
            for i in s[1:]:
                if h < i:
                    break
                ans += 1
        
        print(ans)


func()
```
