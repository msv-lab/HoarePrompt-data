Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic used to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have two installations launching fireworks at intervals \(a\) and \(b\) respectively.
   - Each firework is visible for \(m + 1\) minutes.
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The key insight here is that the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is determined by the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - If \(m\) is a multiple of both \(a\) and \(b\), then the LCM of \(a\) and \(b\) will give us the interval at which the maximum number of fireworks will overlap.

3. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The code calculates `mn` as `min(a, b) + m`.
   - It then checks if \(m\) is divisible by both \(a\) and \(b\) and neither \(a\) nor \(b\) is 1.
   - If true, it prints `mn // a + mn // b + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The calculation of `mn` as `min(a, b) + m` is not appropriate because it does not account for the LCM correctly.
   - The logic to check divisibility and add 1 is flawed because it does not accurately represent the maximum number of overlapping fireworks.
   - The correct approach should involve calculating the LCM of \(a\) and \(b\) and then determining how many fireworks can overlap within the visibility period \(m\).

5. **Correct Solution:**
   - To solve this correctly, we should:
     - Calculate the LCM of \(a\) and \(b\).
     - Determine how many multiples of the LCM fit into the visibility period \(m\).

Given the above analysis, the provided solution is incorrect because it does not properly account for the LCM and the overlapping fireworks.

Correctness: **False**
