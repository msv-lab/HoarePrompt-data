The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) (where \(1 \leq a, b, m \leq 10^{18}\)). For each test case, it calculates a value \(mn\) as the sum of the minimum of \(a\) and \(b\) and \(m\). Depending on whether \(m\) is divisible by both \(a\) and \(b\) and neither \(a\) nor \(b\) is 1, it prints either \(mn // a + mn // b + 1\) or \(mn // a + mn // b\). The function ultimately outputs a list of these calculated and printed values for all test cases.
