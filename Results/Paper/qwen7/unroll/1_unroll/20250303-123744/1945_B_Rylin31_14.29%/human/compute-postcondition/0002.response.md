Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed as a result of the loop's execution. For each iteration `i` from `0` to `t-1`, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are taken as inputs, and based on the conditions provided, either `mn // a + mn // b + 1` or `mn // a + mn // b` is calculated and printed. Here, `mn` is defined as `min(a, b) + m`.
