Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. Specifically, the logic used to determine `mn` and the subsequent calculation of the number of fireworks is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `1 1 1000000000000000000`
- Expected Output: `2000000000000000002`

However, the program outputs `2000000000000000002`, which is incorrect. The correct approach should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the intervals where both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.

A correct solution would involve calculating the LCM of `a` and `b` and then determining how many fireworks can be seen at any given time within the visibility period `m + 1`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        max_visible = (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b - (m + 1) // lcm_ab
        print(max_visible + 1)

func()
```

This corrected version uses the least common multiple (LCM) to accurately determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
