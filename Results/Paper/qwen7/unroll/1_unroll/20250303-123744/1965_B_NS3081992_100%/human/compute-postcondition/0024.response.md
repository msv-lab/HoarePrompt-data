Postcondition: **`ans` is a list containing the powers of 2, starting from \(2^2\) up to \(2^{l-1}\), where \(l\) is the length of the binary representation `b` of `n`. `k` is either 1 or `k + 1`, and `n` is not equal to 2.**

Explanation: 
- If `k == 1`, the loop appends \(2^2\), \(2^3\), and \(2^4\) to `ans`, making `ans` equal to `[2, 3, 4, 8]`. `k` remains 1, and `l` is updated to 4.
- If `k != 1`, the list `ans` is initialized as `[1, 2, 4, 2, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2`, and `k` is updated to `k + 1`. However, the incomplete nature of the else part suggests that the final state of `ans` depends on the initial value of `k` and the specific logic within the else block, which isn't fully specified here. Nonetheless, the key points are that `ans` will contain powers of 2, `k` will be incremented, and `n` will not be equal to 2.
