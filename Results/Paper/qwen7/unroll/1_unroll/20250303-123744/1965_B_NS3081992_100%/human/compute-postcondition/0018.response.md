Output State: **ans is [1, 2, 4].**

Explanation: The loop runs for `lk - 1` iterations, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix. Since no specific value for `k` is given, we consider the simplest case where `k = 3` (binary `11`), so `lk = 2`. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 1`, appending `2 ** i` to `ans` in each iteration. Thus, `ans` becomes `[1, 2]` after the first iteration and then `[1, 2, 4]` after the second iteration.
