Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding a sequence \(a\) of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
   - There is no subsequence of \(a\) with a sum of \(k\).
   - For all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there is a subsequence of \(a\) with a sum of \(v\).

2. The provided code defines a function `func_14()` that generates a sequence \(a\) based on the given \(n\) and \(k\). Let's analyze this function:

   - If \(k = 1\):
     - If \(n = 2\), the function returns "1\n2", which means the sequence is \([2]\).
     - Otherwise, the function constructs a sequence \([2, 3, 4, 8]\) and appends powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{l-1}\), where \(l\) is the length of the binary representation of \(n\).

   - If \(k > 1\):
     - The function constructs a sequence based on the binary representation of \(k\). It includes powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{lk-1}\) where \(lk\) is the length of the binary representation of \(k\). It also includes specific values derived from \(k\).

3. The generated sequences meet the required conditions:
   - No subsequence sums to \(k\).
   - All other sums from 1 to \(n\) (excluding \(k\)) are covered by the constructed sequence.

4. The function `func_15()` iterates over the number of test cases (read from input) and calls `func_14()` for each test case, printing the result.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to generate the required sequence for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
