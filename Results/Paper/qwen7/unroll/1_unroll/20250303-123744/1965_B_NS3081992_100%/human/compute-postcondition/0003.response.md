Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the given sequence `a` meets specific conditions related to subsequences and their sums.**

This means the function `func_15` does not accept any parameters but checks if a sequence `a` satisfies two main conditions:
1. There is no integer `k` within the range `1 <= k <= 10^6` such that the sum of any subsequence of `a` equals `k`.
2. For all integers `v` in the range `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there exists a subsequence of `a` whose sum equals `v`.

The function then returns `True` if both conditions are met, otherwise it returns `False`.
