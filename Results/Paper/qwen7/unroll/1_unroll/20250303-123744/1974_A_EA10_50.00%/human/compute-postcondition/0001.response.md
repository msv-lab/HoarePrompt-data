State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `a` must be at least 1**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts from 0 as per the `range(a)` function.
- For the loop to execute, the value of `a` must be at least 1 because the loop runs from 0 to `a-1`.
- The initial value of `t` (which is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\)) does not affect whether the loop will execute or not. Therefore, it does not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` starts at 0 and `a` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
