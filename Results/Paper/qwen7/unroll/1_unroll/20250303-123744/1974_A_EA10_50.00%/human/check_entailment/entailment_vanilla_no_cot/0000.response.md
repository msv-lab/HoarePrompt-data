Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
- We need to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens.
- Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means each screen can hold up to 15 icons (since \(5 \times 3 = 15\)).
- A 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, so we need to account for this when calculating the space taken by the icons.

### Given Program
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < x:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
2. **Calculating Minimum Screens Needed**:
   - `z = (y + 1) // 2`: This calculates the minimum number of screens needed just for the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and each screen can hold up to 15 cells, we calculate how many full screens are needed for the 2x2 icons.
   - `m = 15 * z - y * 4`: This calculates the remaining capacity of the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - `if m < x`: If the remaining capacity is less than the number of 1x1 icons, we need additional screens to fit the 1x1 icons.
   - `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`: This calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons, ensuring that we round up to the nearest whole number of screens.

### Testing the Program
Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**: `1 1`
   - `y = 1`, so `z = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`.
   - `m = 15 * 1 - 1 * 4 = 11`.
   - `x = 1`, and `11 >= 1`, so no additional screens are needed.
   - Result: `1` (Correct).

2. **Test Case 2**: `7 2`
   - `y = 2`, so `z = (2 + 1) // 2 = 1`.
   - `m = 15 * 1 - 2 * 4 = 7`.
   - `x = 7`, and `7 >= 7`, so no additional screens are needed.
   - Result: `1` (Correct).

3. **Test Case 3**: `12 4`
   - `y = 4`, so `z = (4 + 1) // 2 = 2`.
   - `m = 15 * 2 - 4 * 4 = 22`.
   - `x = 12`, and `22 >= 12`, so no additional screens are needed.
   - Result: `2` (Correct).

4. **Test Case 4**: `0 3`
   - `y = 3`, so `z = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2`.
   - `m = 15 * 2 - 3 * 4 = 24`.
   - `x = 0`, and `24 >= 0`, so no additional screens are needed.
   - Result: `2` (Correct).

5. **Test Case 5**: `1 0`
   - `y = 0`, so `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`.
   - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`.
   - `x = 1`, and `0 < 1`, so we need an additional screen.
   - Result: `1` (Correct).

6. **Test Case 6**: `8 1`
   - `y = 1`, so `z = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`.
   - `m = 15 * 1 - 1 * 4 = 11`.
   - `x = 8`, and `11 >= 8`, so no additional screens are needed.
   - Result: `1` (Correct).

7. **Test Case 7**: `0 0`
   - `y = 0`, so `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`.
   - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`.
   - `x = 0`, and `0 >= 0`, so no additional screens are needed.
   - Result: `0` (Correct).

8. **Test Case 8**: `2 0`
   - `y = 0`, so `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`.
   - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`.
   - `x = 2`, and `0 < 2`, so we need an additional screen.
   - Result: `1` (Correct).

9. **Test Case 9**: `15 0`
   - `y = 0`, so `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`.
   - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`.
   - `x = 15`, and `0 < 15`, so we need an additional screen.
   - Result: `1` (Correct).

10. **Test Case 10**: `8 2`
    - `y = 2`, so `z = (2 + 1) // 2 = 1`.
    - `m = 15 * 1 - 2 * 4 = 7`.
    - `x = 8`, and `7 < 8`, so we need an additional screen.
    - Result: `1` (Correct).

11. **Test Case 11**: `0 9`
    - `y = 9`, so `z = (9 + 1) // 2 = 5`.
    - `m = 15 * 5 - 9 * 4 = 45`.
    - `x = 0`, and `45 >= 0`, so no additional screens are needed.
    - Result: `5` (Correct).
