### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of screens required to place all icons.
   - Each screen has 5 rows and 3 columns, which means each screen can hold up to \(5 \times 3 = 15\) icons.
   - Icons can either be 1x1 or 2x2 (which occupy 4 cells).

2. **Initial Calculation:**
   - The number of 2x2 icons that can fit on one screen is \((5 \times 3) / 4 = 3.75\), so we take the integer part, which is 3.
   - Therefore, for \(y\) 2x2 icons, we need \(\lceil y / 3 \rceil\) screens just for these icons.

3. **Remaining Space Calculation:**
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining space on the screen is \(15 - 4 \times \text{number of 2x2 icons}\).
   - This remaining space can be filled with 1x1 icons. 

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The remaining space can hold \(\text{remaining space} \div 1 = \text{remaining space}\) icons.
   - If the remaining space is not enough to place all the 1x1 icons, we need additional screens.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If there are no 2x2 icons (\(y = 0\)), the calculation simplifies to \(\lceil x / 15 \rceil\).
   - If the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons is negative, it means we need to add an extra screen to accommodate the 1x1 icons.

6. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The given code calculates the number of screens needed correctly.
   - It uses the formula \((y + 1) // 2\) to calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
   - It then checks if the remaining space is sufficient for the 1x1 icons and adjusts the count accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of screens needed. It handles both the placement of 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons accurately.

**Correctness: True**
