You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program:
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a specified number of test cases, where each test case involves an integer \( n \) (such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \)). For each \( n \), if \( n = 1 \), it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( n \). The function implicitly accepts the number of test cases as input and does not return any value, instead printing the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the final position of the element `1` in the array after performing a series of swaps.
   - Each swap involves swapping the elements at positions `d` and `k`, where `d` is the largest proper divisor of `k`.

2. **Analyzing the Swap Operation:**
   - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, we perform `swap(i)`.
   - The largest proper divisor `d` of `i` is used to swap `a_d` and `a_i`.

3. **Behavior of the Array:**
   - Initially, `a[i] = i` for all `i`.
   - When `swap(k)` is performed, the value at position `d` moves to position `k`, and vice versa.
   - This means that the element `k` will move to position `d`, and the element `d` will move to position `k`.

4. **Tracking the Position of `1`:**
   - The key observation is that the element `1` will never be moved to any position greater than 1 because its largest proper divisor is 1.
   - Therefore, `1` will always remain at position 1 unless it is explicitly swapped out.

5. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The provided code attempts to calculate the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` and uses logarithms to do so.
   - However, the logic for determining the position of `1` is flawed.
   - Specifically, the code does not correctly simulate the swap operations and does not track the movement of the element `1`.

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve this problem, we should simulate the swap operations or use a more direct method to determine the final position of `1`.
   - A simpler approach is to realize that the element `1` will always stay at position 1 because its largest proper divisor is 1, and thus it will never be swapped out.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It attempts to use logarithms to determine the position of `1`, which is not relevant to the actual behavior of the swap operations.
