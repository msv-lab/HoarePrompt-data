Output State: **The program returns the value of `c` multiplied by `a` and then taken modulo 1000000007.**

Explanation: The code snippet provided returns the product of `c` and `a` modulo 1000000007. Here, `c` is the result of the function call `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, and `a` is an integer. Since the exact values of `a` and `c` are not specified, the output is expressed in terms of these variables.
