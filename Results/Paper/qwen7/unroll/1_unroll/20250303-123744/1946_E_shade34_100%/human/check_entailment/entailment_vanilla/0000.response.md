### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of permutations of length `n` that satisfy given conditions of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The prefix maximums are the indices where the element is the largest among all elements before it.
   - The suffix maximums are the indices where the element is the largest among all elements after it.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If there is an overlap between the prefix and suffix maximums, the only possible permutation is one where the maximum element is placed at the overlapping index.
   - If there is no overlap, we can independently place the maximum elements for the prefix and suffix parts.

3. **Algorithm Breakdown:**
   - The given code includes two helper functions `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` computes the modular multiplicative inverse using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
   - `func_2` uses `func_1` to compute the modular exponentiation efficiently.

4. **Relevance to the Problem:**
   - The problem requires counting permutations, which involves combinatorial calculations.
   - The provided functions do not directly relate to solving the permutation problem but are useful for modular arithmetic operations.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The problem description and example inputs suggest that the solution should handle the combinatorial logic of placing prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The given code does not implement the required combinatorial logic to solve the problem.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not used in the context of solving the permutation problem as described.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the permutation problem as described. Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
