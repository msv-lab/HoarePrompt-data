### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of permutations of length `n` that satisfy given conditions of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The prefix maximums are the indices where the element is the largest among all elements before it.
   - The suffix maximums are the indices where the element is the largest among all elements after it.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If there is an overlap between the prefix and suffix maximums, the only possible permutation is one where the maximum element is placed at the overlapping index.
   - If there is no overlap, we can independently place the maximum elements for the prefix and suffix parts.

3. **Algorithm Breakdown:**
   - The given code includes two helper functions `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` computes the modular multiplicative inverse using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
   - `func_2` uses `func_1` to compute the modular exponentiation efficiently.

4. **Relevance to the Problem:**
   - The problem requires counting permutations, which involves combinatorial calculations.
   - The provided functions do not directly relate to solving the permutation problem but are useful for modular arithmetic operations.
   - The core logic for solving the permutation problem involves calculating the number of ways to place the prefix and suffix maximums while ensuring the constraints are met.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The given code does not implement the required combinatorial logic to solve the permutation problem as described.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not used in the context of solving the permutation problem as described.
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the provided code does not solve the problem as intended.

6. **Function Summaries:**
   - `func_1` computes the modular multiplicative inverse, which is essential for modular arithmetic operations.
   - `func_2` uses `func_1` to perform modular exponentiation, which is also important for handling large numbers in modular arithmetic.
   - These functions are indeed relevant to the problem, but they are not directly implemented in the main logic of the solution.

Given the above points, the original assessment correctly identified that the provided code does not solve the problem as intended. However, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are relevant and could be part of a correct solution if integrated properly.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the permutation problem as described. Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
