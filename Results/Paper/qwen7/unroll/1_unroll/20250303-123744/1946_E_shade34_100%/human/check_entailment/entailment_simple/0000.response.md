Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`. It also correctly reads the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

2. **Edge Cases Handling**: The program checks if the last index of prefix maximums (`p[-1]`) is equal to the first index of suffix maximums (`s[0]`), and if the first index of prefix maximums (`p[0]`) is 1 and the last index of suffix maximums (`s[-1]`) is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, the program prints `0` indicating no valid permutation exists, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Combinatorial Calculations**: The program uses combinatorial calculations to determine the number of valid permutations. Specifically, it calculates combinations using the `func_2` function, which is a modified version of the modular multiplicative inverse function `func_1`. This is used to compute binomial coefficients modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Permutation Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the number of permutations by considering the gaps between consecutive prefix and suffix maximums. It multiplies the appropriate binomial coefficients and takes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Modulo Operation**: The program ensures that all intermediate results and the final result are taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is necessary due to the large size of the numbers involved.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the logic required to solve the problem accurately.

Correctness: **True**
