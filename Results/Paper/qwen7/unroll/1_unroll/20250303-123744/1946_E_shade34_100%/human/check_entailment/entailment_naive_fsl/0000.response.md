Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not seem to address the problem description at all. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not appear to be related to the task of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. These functions seem to be implementing extended Euclidean algorithm for finding modular inverses, which is not relevant to the given problem.

To solve the problem, we would need to construct permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums and ensure that the constraints are met. The current implementation does not handle the construction or validation of such permutations, hence it is incorrect.
