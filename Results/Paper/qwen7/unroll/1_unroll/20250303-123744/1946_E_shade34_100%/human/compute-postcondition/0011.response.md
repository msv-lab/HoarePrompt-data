Output State: **The program returns the remainder of b divided by (a % b) and the difference between c and the floor division of a by b multiplied by the remainder of b divided by (a % b)**

To break it down:
- We know `a` is a non-negative integer and `b` is a non-negative integer not equal to 0, with `a >= b > 0` and `a` is not divisible by `b`.
- `c` is the quotient of `b` divided by `(a % b)`.
- `d` is the remainder of `b` divided by `(a % b)`.

The return statement calculates two things:
1. The remainder `d` of `b` divided by `(a % b)`.
2. The difference between `c` and the floor division of `a` by `b` multiplied by `d`.

So, the final output is the tuple containing `d` and the calculated difference.
