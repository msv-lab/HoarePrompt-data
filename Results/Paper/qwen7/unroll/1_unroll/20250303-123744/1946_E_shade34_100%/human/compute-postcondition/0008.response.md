Output State: **The program returns 1 and -(a // b - 1)**

Explanation: Given the initial state, `a` is a non-negative integer that is divisible by `b`, and `b` is a non-negative integer not equal to 0. The expression `a // b` performs integer division, which gives the quotient when `a` is divided by `b`. Since `a` is divisible by `b`, `a // b` will be a non-negative integer. Subtracting 1 from this quotient and then taking the negative of the result gives us the second part of the return value. Therefore, the program returns a tuple containing `1` and the negation of the integer one less than the quotient of `a` divided by `b`.
