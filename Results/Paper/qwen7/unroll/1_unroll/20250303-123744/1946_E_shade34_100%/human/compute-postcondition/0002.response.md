Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `a`, an integer; and `b`, a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (m1, m2, n) representing the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively. The function returns the value of `c` multiplied by `a` and then taken modulo 1000000007.**

Note: Here, `c` is derived from the elements in list `b` but its exact calculation is not specified in the given information.
