### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of permutations of length `n` that satisfy given conditions of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The prefix maximums are the indices where the element is the largest among all elements before it.
   - The suffix maximums are the indices where the element is the largest among all elements after it.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If there is an overlap between the prefix and suffix maximums, the only possible permutation is one where the maximum element is placed at the overlapping index.
   - If there is no overlap, we can independently place the maximum elements for the prefix and suffix parts.

3. **Algorithm Breakdown:**
   - The given code includes two helper functions `func_1` and `func_2`.
     - `func_1` computes the modular multiplicative inverse using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
     - `func_2` uses `func_1` to compute the modular exponentiation efficiently.
   - The main part of the code processes the input and calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial logic.

4. **Relevance to the Problem:**
   - The problem requires counting permutations, which involves combinatorial calculations.
   - The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used to handle modular arithmetic operations, which are necessary for calculating combinations and permutations under modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The code initializes a list `facts` to store factorials up to 200001, which is used for calculating combinations.
   - The main loop processes each test case, checks for overlaps between prefix and suffix maximums, and calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial logic.
   - The logic for calculating the number of valid permutations is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

6. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - The code correctly handles the combinatorial calculations needed to determine the number of valid permutations.
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the results fit within the required constraints.
   - The logic for handling overlaps and independent placements of prefix and suffix maximums is implemented correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the permutation problem as described. The provided code accurately counts the number of valid permutations under the given constraints.

**Correctness:** True
