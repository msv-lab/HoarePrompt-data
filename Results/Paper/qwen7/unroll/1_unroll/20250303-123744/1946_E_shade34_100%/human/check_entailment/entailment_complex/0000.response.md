### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Checks:**
   - The code correctly parses the input and checks if the last index of the prefix maximums (`p`) matches the first index of the suffix maximums (`s`). If they do not match, it immediately prints `0` because no permutation can satisfy both conditions simultaneously.
   - The code also checks if the first index of the prefix maximums is `1` and the last index of the suffix maximums is `n`, which is necessary for a valid permutation.

2. **Combinatorial Calculations:**
   - The code uses combinatorial calculations to determine the number of possible permutations. Specifically, it calculates combinations using the `func_2` function, which is a wrapper around `func_1`.
   - The `func_1` function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to compute modular inverses, which are used in the combination formula to ensure the result is within the modulo `1000000007`.

3. **Combination Calculations:**
   - For each segment between consecutive prefix maximums and suffix maximums, the code calculates the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements using combinations.
   - The code iterates through the segments and multiplies the results, taking care to apply the modulo operation at each step to prevent overflow.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as when there are no prefix or suffix maximums, or when the input does not form a valid permutation.
   - The constraints on the input sizes are respected, and the code efficiently computes the results using modular arithmetic.

Given the above points, the code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly handles the input parsing, checks for valid permutations, and performs the necessary combinatorial calculations to determine the number of possible permutations.
