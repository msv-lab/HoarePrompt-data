### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand why.

#### Problem Description:
The problem requires us to determine the number of permutations of length \( n \) that satisfy the given conditions of having specific indices as prefix and suffix maximums. This involves constructing permutations based on these constraints and ensuring they meet the criteria.

#### Provided Code:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse of two numbers. Specifically, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the coefficients \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b) \). However, the function is only returning \( (c, d) \), where \( c \) is the GCD and \( d \) is the coefficient corresponding to \( b \).

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function uses `func_1` to find the modular inverse of \( a \) modulo \( 1000000007 \) (a prime number). It then multiplies this inverse by \( a \) and takes the result modulo \( 1000000007 \). Essentially, it computes \( a^{-1} \mod 1000000007 \).

#### Function Summary:
The summary indicates that `func_2` is used to compute the modular inverse of a number, which is not directly related to solving the permutation problem described. The problem requires constructing and validating permutations, which is not addressed by these functions.

Given the problem's requirements and the nature of the provided functions, it is clear that the code does not implement the logic needed to solve the problem. The functions are unrelated to the task of constructing and counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not address the problem description and instead focuses on computing modular inverses, which is irrelevant to the task of constructing and counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.
