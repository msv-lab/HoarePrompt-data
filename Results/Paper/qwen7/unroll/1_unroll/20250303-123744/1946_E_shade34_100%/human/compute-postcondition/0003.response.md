Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `a` and a list of tuples `b`. Each tuple in `b` contains three integers representing the length of a permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums. The function calls another function `func_1` with `b` and a prime number `1000000007` as arguments. It then returns the product of the result `c` from `func_1` and `a`, modulo `1000000007`.**
