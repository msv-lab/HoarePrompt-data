Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid represented as a list of n strings containing '0's and '1's. For each test case, it checks if the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's. If the first two strings in the grid contain the same number of '1's, it prints 'SQUARE'; otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. This process repeats for each test case specified by the user, and the final output is a sequence of 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' based on the grid analysis for each test case.**
