### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It correctly parses the number of people in front (`na_frente`) and the maximum allowable final position (`pos_final`).

2. **Cost Arrays**:
   - The program correctly reads and stores the `custo_pra_trocar_a` (costs to swap positions) and `custo_pra_passar_b` (costs to pass through positions) arrays.

3. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `total` to 0, which keeps track of the cumulative cost.
   - It initializes `best` to \(10^{12}\), which will store the minimum cost found.

4. **Loop Through Positions**:
   - The loop iterates from `na_frente` to 0, checking if the current position is within the allowed final position (`pos_final`).
   - If the current position is within the allowed final position, it updates `best` and `total` based on whether swapping or passing is cheaper.
   - If the current position is outside the allowed final position, it simply adds the appropriate cost to `total`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost stored in `best` for each test case.
