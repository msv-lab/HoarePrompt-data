Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it calculates the minimum total cost to move from position `na_frente` to position `pos_final`. It considers two possible actions at each position: either to stay (which incurs a cost from the `custo_pra_trocar_a` list) or to move (which incurs a cost from the `custo_pra_passar_b` list). The function prints the minimum total cost for each test case.**
