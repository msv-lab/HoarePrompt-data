### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly parses the number of test cases (`cases`) and iterates through each test case.
   - It then correctly extracts `na_frente` (number of people in front of Kirill) and `pos_final` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill).

2. **Cost Lists**:
   - The program correctly creates lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` from the input, which represent the costs associated with swapping and passing, respectively.

3. **Variable Adjustments**:
   - The program correctly adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1, which is necessary because the indices start from 0.

4. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum cost. It iterates backward from `na_frente` to 0, updating the `best` cost.
   - For each position `v`, it checks whether moving Kirill to position `v` would result in a lower cost compared to the current `best` cost.
   - It updates `total` with the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the `best` cost, which represents the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input parsing, cost calculations, and dynamic programming approach accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
