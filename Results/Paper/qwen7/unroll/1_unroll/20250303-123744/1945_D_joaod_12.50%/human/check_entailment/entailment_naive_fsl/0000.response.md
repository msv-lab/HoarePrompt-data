Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people in the queue. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the cost of bribing multiple people between Kirill's current position and his target position.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 2
  7 3 6 9
  4 3 8 5
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - Kirill starts at position 4 (last person).
  - He needs to move to either position 1 or 2 (since `m = 2`).

- **Analysis:**
  - If Kirill moves from position 4 to position 3, he pays `custo_pra_trocar_a[3] = 6` coins.
  - From position 3 to position 2, he pays `custo_pra_passar_b[2] = 8` coins.
  - From position 2 to position 1, he pays `custo_pra_passar_b[1] = 3` coins.
  - Total cost: `6 + 8 + 3 = 17` coins.

However, the program calculates the cost as follows:
- It initializes `total` to 0 and `best` to `10 ** 12`.
- It iterates from position 3 to position 0.
- When it reaches position 3, it updates `best` to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[3] = 0 + 6 = 6`.
- It then adds `custo_pra_passar_b[2] = 8` to `total`, making `total = 14`.
- It continues to the next iteration, adding `custo_pra_passar_b[1] = 3` to `total`, making `total = 17`.

The program incorrectly updates `best` to 6 and then adds the subsequent costs without considering the optimal path. This leads to an incorrect result of 14 coins instead of the expected 17 coins.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle the cumulative costs and does not find the minimum cost path for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people.
