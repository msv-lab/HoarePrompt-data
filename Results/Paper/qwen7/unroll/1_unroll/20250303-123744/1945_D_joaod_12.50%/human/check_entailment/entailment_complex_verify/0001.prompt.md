You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    #State: After executing the loop for each case, the value of `best` will be printed for each case, representing the minimum total cost for each case based on the given conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it calculates the minimum total cost to move from position `na_frente` to position `pos_final`. It considers two possible actions at each position: either to stay (which incurs a cost from the `custo_pra_trocar_a` list) or to move (which incurs a cost from the `custo_pra_passar_b` list). The function prints the minimum total cost for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly parses the number of test cases (`cases`) and iterates through each test case.
   - It then correctly extracts `na_frente` (number of people in front of Kirill) and `pos_final` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill).

2. **Cost Lists**:
   - The program correctly creates lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` from the input, which represent the costs associated with swapping and passing, respectively.

3. **Variable Adjustments**:
   - The program correctly adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1, which is necessary because the indices start from 0.

4. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum cost. It iterates backward from `na_frente` to 0, updating the `best` cost.
   - For each position `v`, it checks whether moving Kirill to position `v` would result in a lower cost compared to the current `best` cost.
   - It updates `total` with the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the `best` cost, which represents the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input parsing, cost calculations, and dynamic programming approach accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
