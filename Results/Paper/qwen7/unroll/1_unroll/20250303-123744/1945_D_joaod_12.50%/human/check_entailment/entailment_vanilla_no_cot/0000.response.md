Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: It initializes necessary variables like `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `total`, and `best` appropriately.
3. **Loop Through Queue**: The loop iterates backward through the queue from the last person to the first, ensuring that the conditions for moving Kirill to an earlier position are checked correctly.
4. **Cost Calculation**: It calculates the cost of moving Kirill to an earlier position (`custo_pra_trocar_a`) and the cost of passing through intermediate positions (`custo_pra_passar_b`), updating the `total` and `best` accordingly.
5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the minimum cost (`best`) for each test case.

The logic handles all the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
