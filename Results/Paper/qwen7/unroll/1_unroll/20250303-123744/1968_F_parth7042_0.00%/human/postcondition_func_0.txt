The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t`, followed by `n` and `q` integers, a list `a` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r`. For each test case, the function checks if there exists a subarray within the range `[l, r]` whose bitwise XOR is zero. If such a subarray is found, the result for that query is 'YES'; otherwise, it is 'NO'. The function then prints the results for all queries in the order they were processed, followed by an empty line.
