Output State: `idx` is 6, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `results` is a list containing 'NO' repeated `q * (len(data) // (2 * t))` times.

Explanation: The loop processes each test case defined by `t` and then iterates over the queries `q` for each test case. After processing all queries for a test case, it moves on to the next test case. Since the exact values of `data` are not provided, we can only determine the final value of `idx` which will be at the position `6 + 2 * t * (len(data) // (2 * t))`, but given the constraints of the problem, `idx` ends up being 6 more than its initial value. The `results` list will contain 'NO' repeated for each query across all test cases, as no conditions in the loop body result in appending 'YES' to `results`.
