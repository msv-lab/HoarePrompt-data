Functionality: **The function processes two input strings, `x` and `y`, which represent integers of the same length consisting of digits from 1 to 9. It prints two new strings. The first string contains the maximum digit between the corresponding digits of `x` and `y` up to the point where the digits differ, and then the minimum digit thereafter. The second string contains the minimum digit between the corresponding digits of `x` and `y` up to the point where the digits differ, and then the maximum digit thereafter. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the two new strings.**
