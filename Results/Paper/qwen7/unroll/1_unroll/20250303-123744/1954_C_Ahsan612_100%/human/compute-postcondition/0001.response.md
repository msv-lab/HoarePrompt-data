Output State: The output state consists of two strings of integers, each of the same length as the input strings `x` and `y`. For each position in these strings:

- The first string (formed by `new`) will contain the maximum digit at that position from either `x` or `y`, followed by the minimum digit at the first differing position, and then the minimum of the remaining digits.
- The second string (formed by `new2`) will contain the minimum digit at that position from either `x` or `y`, followed by the maximum digit at the first differing position, and then the maximum of the remaining digits.
