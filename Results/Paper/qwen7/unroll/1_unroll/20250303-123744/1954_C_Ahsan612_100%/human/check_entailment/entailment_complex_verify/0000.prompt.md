You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

    #State: Output State: The output state consists of two strings of digits, each of the same length as the input strings `x` and `y`. For each position in these strings:
    #
    #- The first string (from the `new` list) contains the maximum digit between the corresponding digits of `x` and `y` up to the point where the digits differ, and then the minimum digit thereafter.
    #- The second string (from the `new2` list) contains the minimum digit between the corresponding digits of `x` and `y` up to the point where the digits differ, and then the maximum digit thereafter.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two input strings, `x` and `y`, which represent integers of the same length consisting of digits from 1 to 9. It prints two new strings. The first string contains the maximum digit between the corresponding digits of `x` and `y` up to the point where the digits differ, and then the minimum digit thereafter. The second string contains the minimum digit between the corresponding digits of `x` and `y` up to the point where the digits differ, and then the maximum digit thereafter. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the two new strings.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping their digits. Specifically, the logic in the `while` loop does not ensure that the largest possible digits are moved to the most significant positions for both `x` and `y`.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  2
  9876
  4321
  ```

- Expected output:
  ```
  9876
  4321
  ```

- Program output:
  ```
  9876
  4321
  ```

This test case works correctly, but consider another case:
- Input:
  ```
  2
  9876
  1234
  ```

- Expected output (one of the valid solutions):
  ```
  9876
  4321
  ```

- Program output:
  ```
  9876
  1234
  ```

In this case, the program does not swap the digits to maximize the product. The digit '4' from `y` should be swapped with the smallest digit in `x` (which is '1'), resulting in `9876` and `4321`, respectively. However, the program does not perform this optimal swap, leading to a suboptimal product.

Therefore, the program does not always produce the maximum possible product for `x` and `y`, making it incorrect.
