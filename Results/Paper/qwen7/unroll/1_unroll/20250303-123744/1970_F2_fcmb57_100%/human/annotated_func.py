#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of strings representing the field layout, b is an integer representing the number of steps in the game.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns a tuple containing the concatenated string of the first element of list 'a' and the value of 'dx', and the concatenated string of the second element of list 'a' and the value of 'dy'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of strings `a` and an integer `b`. It returns a tuple containing two elements. The first element is a concatenated string of the first string in list `a` and the value of `dx`, and the second element is a concatenated string of the second string in list `a` and the value of `dy`.
