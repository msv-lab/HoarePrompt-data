### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the field.
   - It initializes dictionaries to store the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - It correctly identifies the initial positions of the Quaffle and goals.

2. **Movement and Action Handling:**
   - The program correctly updates the positions of players and the Quaffle based on the given movements.
   - It handles the elimination of players when they collide with Bludgers.
   - It correctly updates the Quaffle's position when a player catches or throws it.
   - The logic for scoring points is correctly implemented. When a player scores in the wrong goal, the opposing team gets a point.
   - The program prints the appropriate events (scoring, elimination) in the correct order.

3. **Final Score Calculation:**
   - After processing all actions, the program correctly calculates and prints the final score.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the new position of an entity based on the given direction.

However, there is a critical issue with the function `func_1` as described in the function summary. The function summary states that `func_1` returns a tuple containing two elements, each a concatenated string of the corresponding coordinate and the direction's delta. However, the implementation of `func_1` in the program simply adds the direction's delta to the coordinates without any string concatenation.

Here is the relevant part of the program:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

And here is the function summary:
- The function accepts a list of strings `a` and an integer `b`.
- It returns a tuple containing two elements. The first element is a concatenated string of the first string in list `a` and the value of `dx`, and the second element is a concatenated string of the second string in list `a` and the value of `dy`.

Clearly, the function `func_1` in the program does not match the function summary. The program uses `func_1` to update the positions of entities, but the function does not perform any string concatenation, which is inconsistent with the provided function summary.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program has a mismatch between the actual implementation of `func_1` and the provided function summary. The program will not work as intended because it relies on `func_1` to perform operations that are not defined in the function's implementation.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
