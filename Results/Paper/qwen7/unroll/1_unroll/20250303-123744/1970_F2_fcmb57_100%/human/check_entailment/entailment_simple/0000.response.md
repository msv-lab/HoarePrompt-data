### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to update the coordinates of an entity based on the direction provided.
   - However, the implementation of `func_1` is incorrect. It returns a tuple of concatenated strings instead of updated coordinates.
   - Correct implementation should be:
     ```python
     def func_1(position, direction):
         x, y = position
         dx, dy = mouvements[direction]
         return x + dx, y + dy
     ```

2. **Movement Handling**:
   - The movement logic for players and the Quaffle is mostly correct, but there's a mistake in how the elimination of players due to Bludgers is handled.
   - Specifically, the condition `if '.B' in players:` is incorrect because `.B` is a key in the `players` dictionary, not a value. It should check if the player is at the same position as the Bludger.
   - Correct handling should involve checking if the player and Bludger are at the same position and then removing the player from the `players` dictionary.

3. **Scoring Logic**:
   - The scoring logic is generally correct. Points are incremented when a player scores in the opponent's goal, and the Quaffle is reset to the middle of the field.
   - The output format for scoring and elimination is correct.

4. **Overall Structure**:
   - The overall structure of the program is correct, and it correctly processes the input and outputs the required events and final score.
   - The main issue lies in the implementation of the movement function and the handling of player elimination.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues with the `func_1` function and the handling of player elimination, the program is not fully correct.

### Correctness:

**False**
