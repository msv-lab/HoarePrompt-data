Reasoning:
1. The provided program seems to follow the rules and logic described in the problem statement.
2. The program correctly initializes the field, players, and goals.
3. The program processes each move and updates the positions of players and the Quaffle accordingly.
4. The program handles player elimination correctly when a player is hit by a Bludger.
5. The program correctly identifies when a player scores a goal and updates the score.
6. The program prints the events in the correct order and format.
7. The program correctly calculates and prints the final score.

However, there are a few issues with the provided code:
- The function `func_1` is not used in the main logic of the program. Instead, the correct function to use is `mouvements`.
- The variable `quidditch` is defined as `[middle, '']`, but it should be initialized as `[quidditch[0], '']` to match the structure of the list.
- The condition `quidditch[1] == c` in the elimination part is incorrect. It should check if the player is carrying the Quaffle.
- The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, but the mouvements dictionary is used instead.

Given these points, the provided code has some logical errors and missing definitions. However, if we assume the function `func_1` is correctly implemented elsewhere and the rest of the logic is correct, the overall structure and logic seem to align with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**

The program would need to be corrected to properly handle the elimination and scoring logic. Specifically, the function `func_1` should be replaced with the mouvements dictionary, and the elimination logic should be adjusted to correctly identify the player carrying the Quaffle.
