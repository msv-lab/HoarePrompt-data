Output State: **`a` is a list of strings representing the field layout; `x` is the first element of `a`, `y` is the second element of `a`.**

The code `x, y = a` unpacks the list `a` into two variables `x` and `y`. Since `a` is a list of strings, `x` and `y` will be the first and second elements of that list, respectively. All other information about `a` remains unchanged.
