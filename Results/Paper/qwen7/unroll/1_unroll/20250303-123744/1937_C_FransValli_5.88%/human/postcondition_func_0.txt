The function determines two specific indices `k` and `best` in a hidden permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) by asking up to \(3n\) queries. It identifies `k` as the index where the bitwise OR comparison with other indices results in the smallest value, and `best` as the index where the bitwise OR comparison involving `k` results in the smallest value. Finally, it outputs the values of `k` and `best`.
