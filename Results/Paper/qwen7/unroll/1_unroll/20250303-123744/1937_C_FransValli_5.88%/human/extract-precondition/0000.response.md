Precondition: **None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the provided function signature. However, the problem description indicates that you can interact with a hidden permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \), which is a permutation of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\). You can ask up to \(3n\) queries in the form of four indices \(a, b, c, d\) to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation.**
