Output State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input(''))` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the initial state of `t` being an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 is maintained, but now `t` specifically holds the value entered by the user. All other variables (n, f, a, b, and the list m) are not yet defined and remain in their initial state of being unspecified.
