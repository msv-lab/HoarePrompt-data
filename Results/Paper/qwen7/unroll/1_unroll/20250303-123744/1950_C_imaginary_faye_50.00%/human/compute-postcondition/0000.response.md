Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `t`.
   - The input for the loop is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`:**
   - It is given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\).

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `t` is less than or equal to the value of `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing based on the input value.
   - The initial value of `t` is given, but we need to adjust it to reflect the condition under which the loop will execute.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can start and continue running based on the input value. Specifically, we need to ensure that the input value (let's call it `num_tests`) is at least 1, and `t` starts from 1 and increments until it reaches `num_tests`.

Since `t` is initially set to an integer between 1 and 1440, and the loop will run as long as `t` is less than or equal to the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is at least 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the input value (`num_tests`) must be at least 1, and `t` starts from 1.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, num_tests must be at least 1, and t starts from 1**
