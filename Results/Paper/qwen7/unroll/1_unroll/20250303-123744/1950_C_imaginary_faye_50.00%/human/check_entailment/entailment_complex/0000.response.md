Reasoning:
- The function `func_1()` correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
- It correctly processes each test case by reading the number of test cases `t`, then reading each time string `s` in the format "hh:mm".
- The function correctly handles the conversion of hours:
  - If the hour is '00', it prints '12'.
  - If the hour is between '01' and '12', it prints the hour as is.
  - If the hour is between '13' and '23', it subtracts 12 from the hour and adds a leading zero.
- The function correctly appends 'AM' or 'PM' based on whether the hour is 12 or greater than '12'.
- The function does not return any value but prints the converted time strings directly, which matches the problem statement's requirement.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1()` is correct according to the problem description and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
