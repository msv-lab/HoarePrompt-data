Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters starting from 'a', `win` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `win`. All other variables retain their initial states.
