You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The string s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets. It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: Output State: `ps` is the number of times a substring of length `k` containing only characters from the set `us` was found in the string `s`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters starting from 'a', `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the last character of each valid substring of length `k` found in `s`.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES'
    #State: `ps` is the number of times a substring of length `k` containing only characters from the set `us` was found in the string `s`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters starting from 'a', `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the last character of each valid substring of length `k` found in `s`, and `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: Output State: `ps` is the number of times a substring of length `k` containing only characters from the set `us` was found in the string `s`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters starting from 'a', `win` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters starting from 'a', `ans` is a list containing the last character of each valid substring of length `k` found in `s`, and `ps` is less than `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through predefined constraints where `t` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\), for each test case `n` and `k` are integers within the ranges 1 to 26 and 1 to 26 respectively, `m` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function checks if certain conditions are met across all test cases and prints 'YES' if they are.

```

Return Postconditions: The program prints 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
