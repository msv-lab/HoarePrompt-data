Based on the initial state provided:

- `ps` is the number of times a substring of length `k` containing only characters from the set `us` was found in the string `s`.
- `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters starting from 'a'.
- `win` is an empty set.
- `ans` is a list containing the last character of each valid substring of length `k` found in `s`.
- `ps` is less than `n`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or their values; it is a fixed string that will be printed directly.

Output: **NO**
