### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to verify if every possible string of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occurs as a subsequence in the given string `s`. If not, we need to provide an example of such a string.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle one test case.
   - It reads `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input, followed by the string `s`.
   - It initializes a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It uses a set `win` to keep track of the characters encountered in the current window of size `n`.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and updates `win` when a character in `s` matches one in `us`.
   - If `win` contains all `k` characters, it appends the character to `ans` and resets `win`.
   - After processing the entire string, it checks if `ps` (the count of complete windows) is at least `n`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic correctly handles the case where all possible strings of length `n` are present in `s` as subsequences.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic when determining if a string of length `n` is missing. The function assumes that if `ps` is less than `n`, then a string of length `n` is missing. This assumption is incorrect because `ps` only counts the number of complete windows of size `k` found in `s`, not the total number of distinct characters seen in `s`.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The function correctly prints "YES" if all possible strings of length `n` are found.
   - However, the logic for printing "NO" and providing an example is flawed. The function only checks if `ps` is less than `n` and prints an example based on the last character in `ans`. This approach does not guarantee that the printed string is indeed a missing string of length `n`.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - For the first test case (`2 2 4` with `s = "abba"`), the output is "YES" because all possible strings ("aa", "ab", "ba", "bb") are subsequences.
   - For the second test case (`2 2 3` with `s = "abb"`), the output is "NO" and an example is "aa" because "aa" is not a subsequence. However, the function should have identified that "bb" is also missing.
   - For the third test case (`3 3 10` with `s = "aabbccabab"`), the output is "NO" and an example is "ccc" because "ccc" is not a subsequence. However, the function should have identified that "aab" is also missing.

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem statement due to the flawed logic for determining if a string of length `n` is missing.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
