Output State: **`b` is the return value from `func_1(d)`, `n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each list contains its adjacent nodes based on user inputs, `d` is a list of integers representing the shortest distance from node 0 to each node, `previous` is a list of integers representing the previous node in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, and the BFS function has been called with `b` as the argument.**

In this state, the variable `b` is assigned the return value from `func_1(d)`. The other variables retain their initial states, including `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, and the fact that the BFS function has been called with `b` as an argument.
