Output State: **A is False; arr[0] is 1; set_ is [1]; not_c is True**

Explanation: The initial state has `A` as `True`. The code `A = not A` changes the value of `A` to the opposite of its current value. Since `A` was initially `True`, after executing the code, `A` becomes `False`. The values of `arr[0]`, `set_`, and `not_c` remain unchanged.
