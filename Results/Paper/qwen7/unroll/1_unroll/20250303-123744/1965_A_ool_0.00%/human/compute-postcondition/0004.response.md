Output State: **`A` is False; arr[0] is 1; set_ is [1]**.

Explanation: The code `set_ = list(set(arr))` creates a set from the list `arr` and then converts it back to a list. Since `arr[0]` is 1 and assuming `arr` only contains the element 1 (as no other elements are mentioned), the set will contain only the element 1. After converting it back to a list, `set_` will be `[1]`. The values of `A` and `arr[0]` remain unchanged.
