Output State: A is True; arr[0] is 1; set_ is [1]; not_c is True.

Explanation: The loop runs for the single element in `set_`, which is 1. Since there is no second element to compare with, the condition `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1` never evaluates to true, so `not_c` remains True and the loop does not change `A`. Initially, `A` was False, and since `A` is toggled in each iteration of the loop, after one iteration (which doesn't happen here), `A` would become True. Therefore, the final state of `A` is True, while the other variables remain unchanged.
