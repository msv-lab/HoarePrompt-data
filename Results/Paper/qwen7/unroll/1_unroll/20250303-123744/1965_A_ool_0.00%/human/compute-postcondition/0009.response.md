Output State: A is True; arr[0] is 1; set_ is [1]; not_c is True.

Explanation: The loop iterates over the elements of `set_`, which initially contains only one element [1]. Since the loop starts from index 1 and there are no more elements in `set_` to iterate over, the loop body is never executed. Therefore, the value of `A` remains `False` (initially) and then becomes `True` due to the statement `A = not A`. The values of `arr[0]` and `not_c` remain unchanged.
