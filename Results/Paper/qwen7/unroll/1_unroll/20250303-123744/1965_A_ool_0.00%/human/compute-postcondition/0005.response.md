Output State: **`A` is False; arr[0] is 1; set_ is [1]**.

Explanation: The code `set_.sort()` sorts the elements in the set `set_`. Initially, `set_` contains the element `{1}`. Sorting a single-element set does not change its contents. Therefore, `set_` remains `[1]`. The values of `A` and `arr[0]` are not affected by this operation.
