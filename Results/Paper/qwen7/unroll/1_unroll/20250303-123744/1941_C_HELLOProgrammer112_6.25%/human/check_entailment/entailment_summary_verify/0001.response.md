### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed from a string `s` to make it "beautiful". A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - The given solution counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the string and prints their sum. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to minimize deletions.

2. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `t`, a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s`. It then prints the sum of these counts for each test case.
   - The function does not return any value but outputs the results for all test cases.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the string "mmapnapie":
     - The solution would count "map" once and "pie" once, resulting in 2 deletions.
     - However, the optimal solution is to delete the 4th and 9th characters, which results in the string "mmnapie", removing only 2 characters but not counting "map" and "pie" separately.
   - For the string "azabazapi":
     - The solution would count "pie" once, resulting in 1 deletion.
     - However, the optimal solution is to keep the string as is since it does not contain "pie" or "map".

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve this problem, we need to iterate through the string and remove characters such that no "pie" or "map" substrings remain. This involves more complex logic than simply counting occurrences.
   - The provided solution does not handle the removal of characters to form a beautiful string efficiently. It only counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" without considering the optimal removal strategy.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution is incorrect because it does not handle the removal of characters to form a beautiful string efficiently. It only counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" without considering the optimal removal strategy.
