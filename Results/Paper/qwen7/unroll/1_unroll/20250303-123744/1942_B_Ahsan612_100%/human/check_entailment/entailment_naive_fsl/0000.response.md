Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Specifically, the logic used to calculate the MEX value and assign values to the permutation \( p \) is flawed.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

Expected output:
A valid permutation \( p \) such as `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.

However, the provided program generates an incorrect permutation. Let's walk through the program's logic:

1. It initializes `mex` to `n`.
2. It iterates backward through the array `ar` and assigns values to `res` based on the MEX calculation.
3. The logic to update `mex` is incorrect because it only updates `mex` if the current value is greater than the updated `mex`, which can lead to incorrect results.

For the given input `[1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`:
- When `i = 4`, `ar[4] = 2`, so `res[4] = mex - 2`. Since `mex` is initially `5`, `res[4] = 3`.
- When `i = 3`, `ar[3] = 1`, so `res[3] = mex - 1`. Since `mex` is still `5`, `res[3] = 4`.
- When `i = 2`, `ar[2] = -2`, so `res[2] = mex - (-2) = mex + 2`. Since `mex` is still `5`, `res[2] = 7` (which is out of bounds).

This incorrect logic leads to an invalid permutation. A correct approach would involve maintaining the MEX value correctly and ensuring that each element in the permutation is unique and within the valid range.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
