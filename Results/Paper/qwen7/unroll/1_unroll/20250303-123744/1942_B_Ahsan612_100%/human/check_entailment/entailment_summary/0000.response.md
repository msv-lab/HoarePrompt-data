Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( ar \).
3. It initializes a result list `res` with `None` values and sets the initial value of `mex` to \( n \).
4. The loop iterates over the indices of `ar` in reverse order. For each index `i`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
5. After updating `res[i]`, it checks if the updated `mex` is greater than the previously calculated `mex - ar[i]`. If true, it updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]`.
6. Finally, it prints the result list `res` as a space-separated string.

Given the problem description, the logic in the program appears to be correct. The program correctly computes the result based on the provided formula and constraints. Therefore, the program should work as expected for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
