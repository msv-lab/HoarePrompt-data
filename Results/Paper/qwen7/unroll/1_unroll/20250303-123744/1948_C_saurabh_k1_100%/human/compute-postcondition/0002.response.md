Output State: The value of `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each value of `n`, there are two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. After executing the loop, if for any `n`, the condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is met for any odd index `i` (where `1 ≤ i < n-1`), the output will be 'No'. Otherwise, the output will be 'Yes' for that particular `n`.
