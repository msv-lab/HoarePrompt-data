### Reasoning:

The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Here's a detailed breakdown of why the provided solution is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':` is flawed.
     - This condition checks if the robot is stuck in a loop where it cannot move forward. However, this condition alone is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).
     - It only checks if the robot encounters a situation where it would be unable to progress due to consecutive '<' arrows in a specific pattern, but it does not account for other possible paths or configurations.

2. **Lack of Comprehensive Path Checking**:
   - The program only checks for a few specific conditions and immediately prints 'No' if any of these conditions are met. This means it might miss valid paths that could lead to the target cell (2, n).
   - The program should check all possible paths the robot can take, considering the arrows in both rows, and ensure that there is at least one path that leads to the target cell.

3. **Incomplete Logic**:
   - The program does not have a complete logic to explore all possible paths the robot can take. It only checks for a few specific patterns and stops as soon as it finds one of these patterns.
   - A more comprehensive approach would involve simulating the robot's movement through the grid and checking if it can reach the target cell (2, n).

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the provided solution is **incorrect** because it does not fully address the problem requirements and may incorrectly determine that the robot cannot reach the target cell (2, n) when it actually can.

**Correctness: False**
