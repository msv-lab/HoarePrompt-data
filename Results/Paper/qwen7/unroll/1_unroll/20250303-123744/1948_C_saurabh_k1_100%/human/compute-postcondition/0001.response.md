State: **`t` must be greater than 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is a placeholder and does not require adjustment.
- The loop control variable `t` determines whether the loop will execute. Since the loop runs `t` times, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
- The initial value of `t` being within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 does not affect the loop's ability to execute; what matters is that `t` is positive. Therefore, we need to ensure `t` is greater than 0.
