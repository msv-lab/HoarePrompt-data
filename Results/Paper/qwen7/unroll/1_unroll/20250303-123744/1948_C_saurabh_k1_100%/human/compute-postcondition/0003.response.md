Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'Yes' or 'No' responses printed to the console. For each value of `n`, the program checks pairs of characters from strings `a` and `b`. If it finds a pair where both characters are '<' at specific positions (either directly adjacent or one position apart), it prints 'No' and stops further checks for that `n`. Otherwise, after completing the checks for all relevant positions, it prints 'Yes'. The exact sequence of 'Yes' and 'No' depends on the input values provided for `a` and `b` for each `n`.
