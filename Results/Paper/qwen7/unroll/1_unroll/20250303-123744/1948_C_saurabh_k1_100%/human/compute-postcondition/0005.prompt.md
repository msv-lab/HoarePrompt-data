You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; each test case consists of two strings of length n, where each character in the strings is either '<' or '>', representing the direction of the arrow in each cell of the respective row of the grid.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'Yes' or 'No' responses printed to the console. For each value of `n`, the program checks pairs of characters from strings `a` and `b`. If it finds a pair where both characters are '<' at specific positions (either directly adjacent or one position apart), it prints 'No' and stops further checks for that `n`. Otherwise, after completing the checks for all relevant positions, it prints 'Yes'. The exact sequence of 'Yes' and 'No' depends on the input values provided for `a` and `b` for each `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes two strings of length n, where each character is either '<' or '>', representing the direction of arrows in a grid. The function returns a value based on the conditions specified, which could be a boolean, an integer, or a string indicating the outcome of processing these strings.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
