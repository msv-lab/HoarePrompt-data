Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the input value must adhere to this constraint. All other variables remain unchanged, specifically `n` which is not affected by this line of code.
