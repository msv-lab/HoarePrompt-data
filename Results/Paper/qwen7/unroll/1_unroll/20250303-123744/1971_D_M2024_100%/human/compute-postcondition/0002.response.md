Output State: The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. For each input string `a`, the output is either `cut1 + 1` or `cut0 + cut1`, depending on whether `cut0` is zero or not. Here, `cut0` counts the number of transitions from '0' to '1', and `cut1` counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0' in the string `a`.
