You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        cut0 = 0
        
        cut1 = 0
        
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)
        
    #State: Output State: The value printed is either `cut1 + 1` when `cut0` is 0, or `cut0 + cut1` otherwise, where `cut0` and `cut1` are counts of adjacent "01" and "10" pairs in the binary string `a`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of pieces to cut a binary string into so that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string means all '0's come before all '1's.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `a`.
   - It initializes two counters `cut0` and `cut1` to count the number of transitions from '0' to '1' and from '1' to '0', respectively.
   - It iterates through the string to count these transitions.
   - If there are no transitions from '0' to '1' (`cut0 == 0`), it prints `cut1 + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `cut0 + cut1`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Case 1:** If there are no transitions from '0' to '1', it means the string is already sorted. In this case, we need to count the number of pieces that contain at least one '1'. This is correctly handled by `cut1 + 1`.
   - **Case 2:** If there are transitions from '0' to '1', the string is not sorted. Each transition indicates a boundary where a piece ends and another begins. Therefore, the number of pieces required is the sum of the transitions from '0' to '1' and from '1' to '0'. This is correctly handled by `cut0 + cut1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles strings with no transitions correctly.
   - The program handles strings with multiple transitions correctly.
   - The program does not handle cases where the string starts or ends with '1' or '0' separately, but this is not necessary since the logic correctly counts the transitions.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange a binary string into a sorted binary string.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
