Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding logic.
2. The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the encoded string, but instead, it is incorrectly handling the replacement and insertion of characters.
3. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not reversing the mapping from the encoded string back to the original string. Instead, it is trying to construct a new string of unique characters in sorted order and then incorrectly replacing characters in the input string.
4. The program should map each character in the encoded string back to its corresponding character in the original string by using the reverse mapping of the unique characters.

Given these points, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
