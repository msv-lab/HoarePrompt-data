### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to decode a string `b` back to the original string `s` by reversing the encoding process. The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` with unique characters of `s` in alphabetical order, and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

2. **Provided Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to decode the string `b` by creating an auxiliary string `r` with unique characters of `b` in alphabetical order.
   - However, the function incorrectly updates the string `s` by replacing characters directly, which can lead to incorrect results due to the mutable nature of strings in Python.
   - The function also attempts to insert characters into `unique_chars`, which is unnecessary and incorrect for the decoding process.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotation states that after the function call, `i` is 0 and `j` is -1. This suggests that the function did not correctly update the `unique_chars` list.
   - The function returns an empty string, indicating that the logic inside the function is flawed.

4. **Correct Decoding Logic**:
   - To correctly decode, we need to:
     - Create the auxiliary string `r` with unique characters of `b` in alphabetical order.
     - Map each character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

5. **Current Implementation Issues**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly map each character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
   - The function modifies `s` directly, which is incorrect since `s` is not used in the decoding process.
   - The function attempts to insert characters into `unique_chars`, which is unnecessary and incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the decoding logic. The current implementation is flawed and does not achieve the desired decoding. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
