Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding logic. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**: The function `func_1` is intended to decode the string `s`, but it does not follow the correct steps:
   - It creates a sorted list of unique characters from the input string `s`.
   - It attempts to replace each character in `s` with its corresponding symmetric character from the unique characters list.
   - However, instead of replacing characters, it incorrectly manipulates the `unique_chars` list by inserting new characters and adjusting indices, which does not align with the required decoding process.

2. **Decoding Process**: The correct approach should involve:
   - Creating a mapping of each character in the encoded string to its corresponding symmetric character in the sorted unique characters list.
   - Using this mapping to decode the entire string.

3. **Current Implementation Issues**:
   - The function does not actually perform any character replacement.
   - The indices `i` and `j` are used incorrectly, leading to undefined behavior.
   - The function returns an empty string because it does not properly construct the decoded string.

Given these issues, the current implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
