### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to determine the correctness of the provided solution.

#### Problem Description and Expected Behavior:
- The task is to decode an encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`.
- The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` containing all distinct characters of `s` in alphabetical order.
- Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function aims to replace each character in the input string `s` with its symmetric counterpart from the auxiliary string `unique_chars`.
   - However, the function incorrectly modifies `unique_chars` instead of replacing characters in `s`.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The summary states that the function processes the string by replacing each character with the last unique character found in the string, then inserts any remaining unique characters into a new list.
   - This summary does not align with the expected behavior of the encoding process described in the problem.

#### Correct Decoding Process:
- To correctly decode, we need to:
  1. Identify the unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sort them to form the auxiliary string `r`.
  2. Create a mapping from each character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

#### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    char_map = {char: unique_chars[-i-1] for i, char in enumerate(unique_chars)}
    return ''.join(char_map[char] for char in s)
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `unique_chars` contains all distinct characters from `s` in sorted order.
  - `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart.
  - The decoded string is generated by replacing each character in `s` with its corresponding value from `char_map`.

#### Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identified that the provided function does not perform the symmetric replacement correctly.
- The proposed corrected function accurately implements the required decoding logic.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate, and the provided solution needs to be revised as shown above.

### Final:
**False**
