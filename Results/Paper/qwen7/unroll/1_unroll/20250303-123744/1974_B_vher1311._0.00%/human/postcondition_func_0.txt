The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It processes the string by replacing each character with the last unique character found in the string, then inserts any remaining unique characters into a new list. After processing, it returns an empty string if no unique characters are left to join, otherwise, it returns a string of the processed unique characters.
