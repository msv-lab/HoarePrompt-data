The function accepts four parameters: an integer `n` (between 3 and 200,000), two integers `na` and `nb` (each between 1 and `n-2` and their sum equals `n`), and a list `numbers` of `n` positive integers (each between 1 and 10^9). It sorts the `numbers` list in descending order. Then, it divides the sorted list into three groups based on the values of `na`, `nb`, and `nc` (where `nc` is inferred as `n - na - nb`). If `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` returns true, the function returns 'YES' along with the three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`). Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
