Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers such that 1 ≤ `na`, `nb`, `nc` ≤ `n`-2 and `na` + `nb` + `nc` = `n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 10^9 for each `x_i` in `numbers`, and `numbers` is sorted in descending order.**

The `sort(reverse=True)` method sorts the `numbers` list in descending order. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
