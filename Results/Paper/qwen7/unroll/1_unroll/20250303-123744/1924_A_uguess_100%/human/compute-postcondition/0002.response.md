Output State: t is the number of test cases, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets. After executing all iterations of the loop, cnt is an integer representing the number of times a substring of s with all k distinct characters has been found, cur is an integer used to track the presence of each character in the current substring, ans is a string containing the last valid substring of s with all k distinct characters or a constructed string based on the remaining characters if no such substring exists, and there are t outputs, each being either 'YES' if a valid substring was found at least n times or 'NO' followed by a constructed string of length n.
