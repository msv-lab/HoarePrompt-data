### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires checking if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`.
   - If not, it should print "NO" and a counterexample string of length `n`.

2. **Given Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.
   - It uses a bitmask (`cur`) to track which characters have been seen in the current sequence of `s`.
   - The variable `cnt` keeps track of how many unique sequences of length `n` have been found.
   - The variable `ans` stores the last character of the sequence to help form the counterexample if needed.
   - If `cnt` reaches `n`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a counterexample string `ans` by finding the first missing character and padding with 'a's.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The bitmask logic correctly tracks the presence of each character in the sequence.
   - The logic to find the first missing character and construct the counterexample string is sound.
   - The program handles all edge cases as specified in the problem statement.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies when all possible strings of length `n` are present as subsequences.
   - When it finds a missing string, it correctly prints "NO" and provides a counterexample.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution as per the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
