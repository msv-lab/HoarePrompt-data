Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to determine if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appear as subsequences in the given string `s`. If not, we need to find and print one such missing string.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` and the string `s`.
   - It uses a bitmask (`cur`) to track which of the `k` characters have been seen in the string `s`.
   - The variable `cnt` keeps track of how many unique characters have been found.
   - If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been seen, and it increments `cnt`.
   - If `cnt` reaches `n`, it prints "YES", indicating that all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences.
   - If `cnt` does not reach `n`, it identifies the first missing character and constructs a string consisting of this character followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.
   - The program prints "NO" followed by the constructed string.

3. **Edge Cases and Correctness**:
   - The program handles the case where the string `s` might not contain all necessary characters to form all possible strings of length `n`.
   - The logic to identify the first missing character and construct the result string is correct.
   - The program does not return any value but prints the results directly, which is acceptable given the problem constraints.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
