Output State: **The program returns a boolean value 'res' which is True if 'el' starts with 'B' or 'R' and does not end with 'G', otherwise it is False.**

This means the program checks if the string `el` starts with either 'B' or 'R' and does not end with 'G'. If both conditions are met, `res` is set to `True`; otherwise, `res` is set to `False`. The program then returns this boolean value `res`.
