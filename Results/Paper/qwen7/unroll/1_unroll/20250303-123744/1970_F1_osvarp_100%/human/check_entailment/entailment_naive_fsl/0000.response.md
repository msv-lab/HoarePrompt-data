Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal. According to the problem description, if a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team wins the point. However, the program does not account for this case. Specifically, the `goalIn` function and the logic within the main loop do not handle the situation where a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 5

.. .. R0 .. ..

RG .. .Q .. BG

.. .. B0 .. ..

12

R0 D

R0 C .Q

R0 L

R0 L

R0 T

```

In this scenario, the red player (`R0`) takes the Quaffle, moves it, and throws it into the red goal, which should result in the blue team scoring a point. However, the program does not detect this and does not print the appropriate message. Instead, it prints:

```
4 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 1
```

This is incorrect because the red player should not score in the red goal, and the blue team should get the point instead. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
