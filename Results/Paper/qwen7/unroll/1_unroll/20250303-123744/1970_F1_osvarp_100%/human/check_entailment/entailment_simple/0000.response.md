Reasoning:
1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field (`n` and `m`), initializes the grid, and populates the `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, and `points` dictionaries/lists as required by the problem statement.
2. **Action Processing**: The program processes each action correctly:
   - For catching the Quaffle, it updates the `allPlayers` dictionary to mark the player as carrying the Quaffle.
   - For throwing the Quaffle, it updates the `allPlayers` dictionary to mark the player as not carrying the Quaffle and checks if the Quaffle was thrown into a goal, updating the score accordingly.
   - For moving, it checks if the move is valid and updates the position of the player or the Quaffle.
3. **Event Logging**: The program logs events correctly when a player scores a goal or catches the Quaffle, printing the appropriate messages.
4. **Final Score**: The program prints the final score correctly after processing all actions.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem specification accurately and handles all the required functionalities without errors based on the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
