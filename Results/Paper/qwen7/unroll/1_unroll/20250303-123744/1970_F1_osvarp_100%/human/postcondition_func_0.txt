The function processes a game scenario involving two teams on a grid-based field. It reads initial setup data from standard input, including field dimensions, grid layout, player positions, and team goals. The function then simulates a series of commands over multiple time steps, updating player positions and handling events such as catching the Golden Snitch, eliminating players, and scoring goals. Finally, it prints the final scores of both teams.
