To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information:

1. The print statement is: `print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))`
2. This statement uses string formatting to print two integers, which are the values of `points[0]` and `points[1]`.

From the initial state, we know that after executing the loop for `t` iterations, the values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` are determined. However, the specific values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` are not provided in the initial state.

Given this information, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]]**
