Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Player and Ball Actions**: The function `func_1` has a significant issue with handling player and ball actions. Specifically, the logic for moving players and handling ball actions is flawed. For instance, the function does not correctly handle the scenario where a player moves to the same cell as the Quaffle and then throws it. Additionally, the function does not properly update the state of the game after each action.

2. **Missing Movement Directions**: The code snippet provided does not define the `mov` dictionary, which is used to determine the movement directions ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'). This dictionary should map each direction to a coordinate change (e.g., `{'U': (-1, 0), 'D': (1, 0), 'L': (0, -1), 'R': (0, 1)}`).

3. **Incorrect Logic for Scoring**: The scoring logic is not implemented correctly. The function `goalIn` is supposed to determine if a player has scored a goal, but it does not account for the correct team's goal being scored. Also, the function does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal, which would result in the opposing team scoring a point.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Golden Snitch**: The code snippet does not include the logic for catching the Golden Snitch ('.S'), which is mentioned in the problem statement. If a player catches the Golden Snitch, the game should immediately end, and the player's team should be declared the winner.

5. **Missing Initialization of Movement Directions**: The `mov` dictionary is not defined in the provided code, which is necessary for moving players and balls around the grid.

Given these issues, the provided function `func_1` is not correct according to the problem description.
