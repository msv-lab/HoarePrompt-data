Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and m, which are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd. It also accepts a grid (a 2D list of strings), a dictionary elements mapping entities to their positions, a dictionary allPlayers mapping players to whether they are carrying the Quaffle, a list of two lists goal containing the positions of goals for each team, and a list of two integers points representing the current scores of the red and blue teams. The function does not return anything explicitly.**

This means the function processes a game field represented by a grid, along with various entities and their positions, player statuses, and team scores, without returning any specific value.
