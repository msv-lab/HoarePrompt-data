Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze how it handles different test cases based on the problem statement and the provided examples.

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - A square grid of size \( n \times n \) has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - If \( 4n - 2 \) equals \( k \), it prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).
   - Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

3. **Edge Cases and Examples**:
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \):
     - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \).
     - Since \( k < 10 \), it should print \( \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \):
     - Total diagonals: \( 10 \).
     - Since \( k < 10 \), it should print \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \):
     - Total diagonals: \( 10 \).
     - Since \( k = 10 \), it should print \( \frac{10}{2} + 1 = 6 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 9 \):
     - Total diagonals: \( 10 \).
     - Since \( k < 10 \), it should print \( \lceil \frac{9}{2} \rceil = 5 \).
   - For \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 7 \):
     - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 4 - 2 = 14 \).
     - Since \( k < 14 \), it should print \( \lceil \frac{7}{2} \rceil = 4 \).
   - For \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 11 \):
     - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 7 - 2 = 26 \).
     - Since \( k < 26 \), it should print \( \lceil \frac{11}{2} \rceil = 6 \).
   - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \):
     - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 2 - 2 = 6 \).
     - Since \( k < 6 \), it should print \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \).

4. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles all the provided test cases according to the logic described above.

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
