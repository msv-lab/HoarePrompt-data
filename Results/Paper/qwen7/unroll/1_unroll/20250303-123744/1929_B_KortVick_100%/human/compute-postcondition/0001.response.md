State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, _ is not relevant as it is a dummy variable**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is a dummy variable used for iterating over the range of `t`. It does not hold any specific value and is not relevant for adjusting the state.
- The only variable that affects whether the loop can execute is `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000 (inclusive).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is within the specified range.
