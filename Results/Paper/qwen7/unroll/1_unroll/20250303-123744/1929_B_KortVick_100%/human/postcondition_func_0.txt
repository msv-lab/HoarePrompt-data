The function processes a series of test cases defined by the number of tests \( t \). For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \), and outputs either \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) or \( k // 2 + 1 \) based on whether \( 4n - 2 \) equals \( k \). The final state of the program consists of \( t \) lines of output, each corresponding to one test case.
