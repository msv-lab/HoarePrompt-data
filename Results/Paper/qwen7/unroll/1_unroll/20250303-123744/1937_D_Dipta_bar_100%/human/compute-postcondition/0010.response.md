Output State: `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` remains the same list of integers where each element represents the cumulative sum of positions '>' encountered up to that point, adjusted by the number of previous '>' positions and their indices, `idx_A` remains the same list of indices where the character '>' appears in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers where each element is calculated based on the positions of '<' and '>' in the string `s`, and `idx_B` is a list of indices where the character '<' appears in the string `s`.

To explain in more detail:
- `B` will contain values based on the positions of '<' relative to the last '>' found.
- `idx_B` will contain all the indices of characters '<' in the string `s`.
