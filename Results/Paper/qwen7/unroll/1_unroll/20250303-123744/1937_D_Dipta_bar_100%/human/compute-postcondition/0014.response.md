Output State: **The output state will depend on the specific values of `n`, `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B`. The loop processes each character in `s` and updates `a` and `b` based on the conditions provided, then prints the result of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` or `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` for each iteration. The exact output will vary based on the input values.**

To provide a concrete example, let's assume some values for `n`, `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B`:

- `n = 5`
- `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- `B = [6, 7, 8, 9]`
- `idx_A = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `idx_B = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
- `s = "><>"`

In this case, the output state would be:

Output State: **14 16 18 20 22**

This is calculated based on the given values and the logic within the loop.
