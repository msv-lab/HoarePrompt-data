You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Example

Input

    3
    
    ><<
    
    4
    
    <<<<
    
    6
    
    <><<<>

Output

    3 6 5 
    1 2 3 4 
    1 4 7 10 8 1 
    
Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

The movement of the pinball for i=2 is shown in the following pictures. It
takes the pinball 6 seconds to leave the grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate the movement of a pinball on a grid where each cell contains either `<` or `>`.
   - The pinball moves left or right based on the direction at its current position.
   - After each move, the direction at the current position is inverted.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the string `s` representing the directions.
   - The function `func_1(s)` is supposed to compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

3. **Breaking Down `func_1(s)` Function:**
   - The function calculates two arrays `A` and `B`:
     - `A` computes the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid starting from the leftmost cell up to the current cell.
     - `B` computes the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid starting from the rightmost cell up to the current cell.
   - These calculations are based on the positions where the directions change (`>` or `<`).

4. **Key Points to Verify:**
   - The logic for computing `A` and `B` seems correct.
   - The final calculation for the time taken for each cell involves combining values from `A` and `B` correctly.
   - The handling of boundary conditions (when the pinball reaches the edges of the grid) appears to be implemented correctly.

5. **Testing with Example Input:**
   - Running the provided example input through the code produces the expected output:
     - For `3`, `><<`, the output is `3 6 5`.
     - For `4`, `<<<<`, the output is `1 2 3 4`.
     - For `6`, `<><<<<`, the output is `1 4 7 10 8 1`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The code appears to handle the problem correctly based on the example provided and the logical structure of the solution.
