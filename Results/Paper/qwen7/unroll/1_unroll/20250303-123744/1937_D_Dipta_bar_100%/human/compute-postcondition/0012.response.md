Output State: **`r` is equal to the length of list `B`. The values of `l`, `s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged.**

This means that the variable `r` is now assigned the length of the list `B`, while all other variables (`l`, `s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B`) retain their original values from the initial state.
