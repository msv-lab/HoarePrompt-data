Output State: **`tt` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `tt = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `tt`. The precondition that `tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4 remains valid after the code execution, and no other variables are affected.
