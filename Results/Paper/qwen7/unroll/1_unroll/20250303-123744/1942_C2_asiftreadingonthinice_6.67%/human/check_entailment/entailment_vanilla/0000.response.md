### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - It then iterates through each test case, reading the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the list of chosen vertices `a`.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The initial answer `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This accounts for the minimum number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices plus the additional vertices.
   - The program sorts the list of chosen vertices `a` to facilitate the subsequent logic.

3. **Processing Adjacent Chosen Vertices**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of chosen vertices to check the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.
   - If the gap between two consecutive chosen vertices is exactly 2, it adds 1 to `ans` because a triangle can be formed without needing any additional vertices.
   - If the gap is even and there are enough remaining additional vertices (`y`), it calculates how many triangles can be formed by dividing the gap by 2 and updates `ans` and `y` accordingly.

4. **Handling Edge Gaps**:
   - The program checks the gap between the first and last chosen vertices, considering the circular nature of the polygon.
   - Similar to the previous step, if the gap is exactly 2 or even and there are enough remaining additional vertices, it updates `ans` and `y`.

5. **Final Adjustment**:
   - The final value of `ans` is adjusted by adding the remaining additional vertices `y`.
   - The program prints the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`, ensuring that the result does not exceed the total number of possible triangles in a polygon with `n` sides.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and logic required to maximize the number of triangular pieces.
- The logic for calculating the number of triangles formed by the chosen and additional vertices is sound.
- The edge case handling for the circular nature of the polygon is appropriately addressed.

### Conclusion:
Given the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
