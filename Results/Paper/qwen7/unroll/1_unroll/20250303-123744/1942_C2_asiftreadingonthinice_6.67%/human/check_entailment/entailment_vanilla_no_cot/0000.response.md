Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Triangles**:
   - The logic for counting triangles is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2` and the subsequent checks for even differences do not correctly account for forming triangles.
   - The approach of adding `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` directly to `ans` and adjusting `y` is overly simplistic and does not ensure the formation of non-intersecting triangles.

2. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The check for the boundary condition `if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2` and the subsequent logic are also incorrectly implemented. This should be checked differently to ensure the correct number of triangles is formed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the chosen vertices are consecutive or when the remaining vertices (`y`) cannot form additional triangles without causing intersections.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final calculation `print(min(ans, n - 2))` is incorrect. It should consider the actual number of triangles that can be formed without causing intersections.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, possibly involving dynamic programming or graph theory to ensure non-intersecting triangles are formed optimally. The current solution does not address these complexities adequately.
