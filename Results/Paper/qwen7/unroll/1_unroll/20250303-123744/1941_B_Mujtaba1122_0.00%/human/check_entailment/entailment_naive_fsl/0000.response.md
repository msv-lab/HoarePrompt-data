Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not properly handle the reduction of elements according to the given operation rules. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the array `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`. According to the problem description, we need to check if we can reduce all elements to zero using the specified operations. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the reduction process.

For instance, in the array `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`, applying the operation at `i=3` would result in `[2, 4, 3, 3, 1]`, but the subsequent operations do not lead to all elements becoming zero. The function `func_2` does not ensure that the array can be reduced to all zeros, leading to incorrect results.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
