Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n - 1` (since the loop runs from `1` to `n - 1`).

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being `1` because the loop condition is `1 <= i < n - 1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must satisfy the condition `1 <= i < n - 1`. This means `i` should be within this range.

4. **Adjust the State of `n`**: Since `i` starts at `1` and the loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`, `n` must be greater than `2` (because if `n` were `2` or less, `i` would never satisfy `1 <= i < n - 1`).

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is `1` and `n` is greater than `2`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`list` is a list of integers representing the array `a` of length `n`, where `3 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5` and `0 <= a_j \le 10^9`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2**
