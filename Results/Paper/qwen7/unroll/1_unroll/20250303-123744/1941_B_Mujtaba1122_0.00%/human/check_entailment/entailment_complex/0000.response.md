### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False` (though it never explicitly returns `False`, it implicitly does so by not returning).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the elements of the array according to the specified operations.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to `n-2` (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, if `list[i]` is greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0, it performs the following operations:
     - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
   - These operations effectively reduce `list[i]` by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i-1]` by its own value, and `list[i+1]` by the value of `list[i-1]`.

4. **Final Check with `func_1`**:
   - After performing the operations, the function calls `func_1` to check if all elements in the list are zero.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Reduction Logic**: The operations performed in `func_2` are designed to reduce the values of the array elements. Specifically, the reduction logic ensures that if an element `list[i]` is greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0, those elements are adjusted accordingly.
- **Final Check**: The final check with `func_1` ensures that after all possible reductions, if all elements are zero, the answer is "YES". Otherwise, it is "NO".

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the code correctly determines whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

**Correctness: **True**
