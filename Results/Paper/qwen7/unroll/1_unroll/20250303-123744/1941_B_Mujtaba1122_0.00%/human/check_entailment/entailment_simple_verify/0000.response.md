### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
- It iterates through the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds a non-zero element.
- If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function attempts to reduce the array according to the specified operations.
- It iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2 (inclusive).
- For each element `list[i]` (where `1 < i < n-1`), if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`, it performs the following operations:
  - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]` (reduces `list[i-1]` by its own value)
  - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]` (reduces `list[i]` by twice the value of `list[i-1]`)
  - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]` (reduces `list[i+1]` by the value of `list[i-1]`)

After performing these operations, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements in the list are zero.

#### Annotated Code:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the expected behavior of the functions.
- The main loop reads the input and calls `func_2` with the list and its length.
- `func_2` performs the operations and checks if all elements are zero using `func_1`.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The function `func_2` correctly implements the specified operations and ensures that the array is reduced according to the rules.
- The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements are zero.
- The annotated code accurately reflects the state transitions and the expected behavior.

Given the problem description and the annotated code, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. The original assessment incorrectly states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the reduction process correctly, which is actually handled correctly in the provided code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.
