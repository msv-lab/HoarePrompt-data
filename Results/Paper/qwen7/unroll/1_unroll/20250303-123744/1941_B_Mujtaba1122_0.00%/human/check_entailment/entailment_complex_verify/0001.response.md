### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can make all elements of the array `a` zero using the specified operations.
   - The operations involve choosing an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) and decrementing `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by specific amounts.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each operation reduces the sum of the array by exactly 3.
   - To make all elements zero, the total sum of the array must be divisible by 3.

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - `func_2` attempts to perform the operations to reduce the array elements to zero.
     - It iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2.
     - For each element `a[i]` greater than 1, it ensures that `a[i-1]` is also greater than 0 and `a[i+1]` is greater than 0 before performing the operation.
     - The operation reduces `a[i-1]` by `a[i-1]`, `a[i]` by `2 * a[i-1]`, and `a[i+1]` by `a[i-1]`.

4. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly applies the operations to reduce the array elements.
   - The operations ensure that the sum of the array decreases by 3 each time they are applied, which aligns with the requirement to make all elements zero if possible.

5. **Main Function:**
   - The main function reads input, calls `func_2` for each test case, and prints the result.
   - While `func_2` prints 'YES' or 'NO', the overall structure of the program is correct in terms of logic and functionality.

6. **Correctness of the Provided Program:**
   - Although `func_2` prints the result directly instead of returning a value, the program as a whole correctly processes each test case and prints the appropriate result.
   - The program meets the requirements of the problem statement by correctly determining whether it is possible to make all elements zero and printing the result accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct for the given problem statement. It correctly processes each test case and prints the appropriate result, even though `func_2` prints the result directly rather than returning a value.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
