Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if Rudolf can make all elements of the array equal to zero using a specific operation.
- `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero. This function is used to verify the final state of the list after processing.
- `func_2` processes the list according to the specified operation and then uses `func_1` to check if all elements are zero.
- The operation in `func_2` involves reducing elements at index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n-2`) by subtracting values from `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]`. This operation is designed to reduce the values in the list, and the loop continues until no further reductions can be made under the given conditions.
- The logic in `func_2` ensures that if the list can be reduced to all zeros, it will print 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
- Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, `func_2` correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
