Based on the initial state provided, the list is structured such that any element `list[i]` (where `1 < i < n-1`) remains unchanged if it was not greater than 1 initially or if either `list[i-1]` or `list[i+1]` was not greater than 0. After all possible reductions, only elements that were originally 0 or less than or equal to 1 will remain unchanged.

Given this, the print statement `print('NO')` will simply output the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
