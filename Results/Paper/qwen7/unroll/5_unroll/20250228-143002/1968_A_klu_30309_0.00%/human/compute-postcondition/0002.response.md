Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `y`, `x`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop will execute if the range function generates at least one value for `y`.
   - The range function `range(start, stop, step)` will generate values starting from `start` up to but not including `stop`, with a step of `step`.
   - For the range `range(x - 1, 1, -1)`, the loop will execute if `x - 1` is greater than or equal to 1 (since the step is -1, it will count down).

3. **Check the condition `x - 1 >= 1`:**
   - Simplifying the condition, we get `x >= 2`.
   - If `x` is less than 2, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - We need to ensure that `x` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `max_val` is 1, but this does not affect the loop's execution since it is not used in the loop head.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `x` being at least 2.

**State:**
**`max_val` is 1, `x` must be at least 2**
