Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - The loop will iterate based on the value of `int(input())`, which is expected to be the same as `t`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run for `int(input())` iterations. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be a valid non-negative integer.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `t` is known and within the specified range, we can assume that `int(input())` will be equal to `t`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.

5. **State the final state required for the loop to execute**:
   - We need to ensure that `int(input())` is set to `t` to allow the loop to execute correctly.

Given this reasoning, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and int(input()) must be equal to t**
