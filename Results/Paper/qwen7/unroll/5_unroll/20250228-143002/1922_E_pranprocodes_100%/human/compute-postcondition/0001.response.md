Output State: t is the number of steps required to reduce x to 1 by either dividing by 2 when x is even or decrementing by 1 when x is odd, and ans is a list containing integers where max starts at 100000000 and decreases by 1 for each even step, and min starts at -100000000 and increases by 1 for each odd step, with the list reversed at the end.
