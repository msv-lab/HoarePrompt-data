The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer `t` and an integer `X`. For each test case, it calculates the number of steps `t` required to reduce `X` to 1 by repeatedly dividing even numbers by 2 and subtracting 1 from odd numbers. Additionally, it generates a list `ans` where each element represents a value (initially set to either 100000000 or -100000000) that changes according to the operation performed during each step. Finally, it prints the number of steps `t` and the list `ans` in reverse order.
