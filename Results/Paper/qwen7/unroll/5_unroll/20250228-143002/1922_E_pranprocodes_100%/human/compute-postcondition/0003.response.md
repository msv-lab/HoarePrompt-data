Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000 and `X` is an integer within the range 2 to 10^18. It returns a result based on the relationship between `t` and `X`.**

Given the constraints and the implied processing, the function likely evaluates some condition involving `t` and `X` and returns a specific value or message based on that evaluation. However, without the exact logic, we can only describe the parameters and their ranges.
