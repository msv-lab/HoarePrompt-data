You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the current time step in the game. player is a dictionary where keys are player identifiers (e.g., 'R0', 'B0') and values are their current positions represented as [row, column] lists. blud is a list of positions where the Bludger is currently located.
def func_2(t):
    out = []
    for p in player:
        if player[p] == blud:
            out.append(p)
            player[p] = [-1, -1]
        
    #State: Output State: `out` is a list containing player identifiers of those players whose positions matched with the Bludger's position. `t` is an integer representing the current time step in the game. `player` is a dictionary where keys are player identifiers and values are their current positions, with any player whose position matched the Bludger's position updated to `[-1, -1]`. `blud` is a list of positions where the Bludger is currently located.
    for p in sorted(out):
        print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
        
    #State: Output State: The console prints each player identifier `p` from the sorted list `out`, along with the current time step `t`, followed by the string 'ELIMINATED'. This means that for each player whose position matched the Bludger's position, the game prints a statement indicating that the player has been eliminated at the current time step.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the current time step in the game, a dictionary `player` mapping player identifiers to their current positions, and a list `blud` of the Bludger's positions. The function processes this information to determine the state or behavior of players and the Bludger at the specified time step.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
