The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the current time step in the game. It also accepts a parameter `player`, which is a dictionary where keys are player identifiers (e.g., 'R0', 'B0') and values are their current positions represented as [row, column] lists. Additionally, it accepts a parameter `blud`, which is a list of positions where the Bludger is currently located.

The function does not return a value directly from the given information. However, based on the parameters, it seems the function might be involved in determining the state or behavior of players and the Bludger at a specific time step in a game context.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the current time step in the game, a dictionary `player` mapping player identifiers to their current positions, and a list `blud` of the Bludger's positions. The function processes this information to determine the state or behavior of players and the Bludger at the specified time step.**
