### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the annotated code and the problem description.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- **Function Purpose**: Moves an object on a 2D grid based on the direction specified.
- **Correctness**: The function correctly updates the position of the object based on the direction (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`). It checks the direction and updates the corresponding coordinate. However, it does not include any boundary checks to ensure the object stays within the field boundaries (N x M). This could lead to out-of-bound errors if the function is called with invalid directions.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- **Function Purpose**: Eliminates players when they are hit by a Bludger.
- **Correctness**: The function iterates over the players, checks if their position matches the Bludger's position, and if so, appends the player identifier to the `out` list. It then prints the elimination message and sets the player's position to `[-1, -1]`. This part of the function is mostly correct, but it does not handle the case where multiple players are hit simultaneously and need to be printed in alphabetical order. The function should sort the `out` list before printing to ensure the players are printed in the correct order.

#### Main Program Analysis:
- **Initialization**: Reads the dimensions of the field, initializes the positions of goals, players, the Bludger, and the Quaffle.
- **Game Loop**: Iterates through each step of the game, processing actions for players and balls.
- **Player Actions**: Handles player movements, catching, and throwing the Quaffle.
- **Bludger and Player Interaction**: Calls `func_2` to handle player eliminations when they are hit by the Bludger.
- **Scoring**: Updates the score when a player successfully scores a goal and prints the appropriate messages.
- **Final Score**: Prints the final score at the end of the game.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Boundary Checks**: The `func_1` function does not include boundary checks to ensure the object stays within the field boundaries. This could lead to invalid states if the function is called with invalid directions.
2. **Player Elimination Order**: The `func_2` function does not sort the list of eliminated players before printing them, which may result in incorrect order if multiple players are eliminated at the same time.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The main logic of the program handles most of the game rules correctly, including player movements, scoring, and handling the Bludger. However, the lack of boundary checks in `func_1` and the missing sorting in `func_2` introduce potential issues that could affect the correctness of the program.

Given these observations, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not fully implement the rules and logic required to correctly simulate the game due to the missing boundary checks and the unsorted list of eliminated players.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
