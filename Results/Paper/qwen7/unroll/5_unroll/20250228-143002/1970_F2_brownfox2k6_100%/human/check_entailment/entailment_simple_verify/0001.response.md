### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly updates the position of an entity based on the direction (`d`). The logic is straightforward and handles all four possible directions (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`) appropriately.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function correctly identifies players who are in the same position as a Bludger and marks them as eliminated. It iterates over the players dictionary, checks if the player's position matches the Bludger's position, and appends the player's ID to the output list if they are in the same position. It then prints the elimination message for each eliminated player in alphabetical order using `sorted(out)`.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program processes the game steps, updating the positions of players and balls, checking for scoring, and handling eliminations based on the Bludger interactions.
   - The program correctly updates the positions of players and the ball based on the actions specified in the input.
   - The program correctly handles the scoring mechanism when a player throws the Quaffle into the opposing team's goal.
   - The program correctly identifies and prints the elimination messages for players who are hit by the Bludger.
   - The program prints the final score at the end of the game.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the main events of the game in the correct order, including scoring and eliminations.
   - The final score is printed in the correct format.

### Evaluation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**:
  - The program initializes the field dimensions, player positions, and the ball position.
  - The Bludger position is also initialized.

- **Processing Game Steps**:
  - For each step in the game, the program processes the actions:
    - If a player catches the ball, the `carry` variable is updated.
    - If a player throws the ball, the `carry` variable is reset, and the ball is placed back at the player's position.
    - If a player moves, their position is updated using `func_1`.
    - If a player is in the same position as the Bludger, they are marked as eliminated using `func_2`.

- **Scoring Mechanism**:
  - When a player throws the ball into the opposing team's goal, the corresponding score is incremented, and the ball is moved to the center of the field.
  - The program correctly prints the scoring messages.

- **Elimination Mechanism**:
  - When a player is hit by the Bludger, they are marked as eliminated, and their position is updated to `[-1, -1]`.
  - The program correctly prints the elimination messages in alphabetical order.

- **Final Score**:
  - At the end of the game, the program prints the final score in the correct format.

### Conclusion:

- The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correct for their respective tasks.
- The overall program logic correctly processes the game steps, updates the positions of players and balls, checks for scoring, and handles eliminations based on the Bludger interactions.
- The output formatting is correct, and the final score is printed in the correct format.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
