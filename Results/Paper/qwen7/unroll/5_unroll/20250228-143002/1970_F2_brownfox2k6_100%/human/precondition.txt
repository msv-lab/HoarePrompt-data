N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N and M are odd. obj is a string representing an entity on the field (e.g., "R0", "B0", ".Q", ".B", etc.). d is a string representing the direction of movement ("U", "D", "L", "R"). Additionally, the function assumes the existence of a field represented as a 2D list of strings, and the initial state of the field is provided as input.
