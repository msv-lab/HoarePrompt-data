Output State: The console prints each player identifier `p` from the sorted list `out`, along with the current time step `t`, followed by the string 'ELIMINATED'. Each printed line represents one player being eliminated at the given time step. All players whose positions matched the Bludger's position are marked as eliminated and their positions in the `player` dictionary are updated to `[-1, -1]`.
