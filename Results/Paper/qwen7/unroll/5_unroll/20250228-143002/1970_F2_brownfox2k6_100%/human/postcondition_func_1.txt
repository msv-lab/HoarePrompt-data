The function processes the current positions of players and the Bludger at a given time step in the game. It identifies any players whose positions match the Bludger's position and marks them as eliminated by updating their positions to `[-1, -1]`. The function then prints a message for each eliminated player indicating they have been eliminated at the current time step.
