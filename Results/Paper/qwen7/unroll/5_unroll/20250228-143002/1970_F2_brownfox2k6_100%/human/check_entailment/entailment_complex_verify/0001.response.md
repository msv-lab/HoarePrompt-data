### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly updates the position of an entity based on the direction (`d`). It handles the four possible directions (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`) properly.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function correctly identifies players who are in the same position as a Bludger and marks them as eliminated. It iterates over the players dictionary, checks if the player's position matches the Bludger's position, and appends the player's ID to the output list if they are in the same position. It then prints the elimination message for each eliminated player in alphabetical order using `sorted(out)`.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the initial setup of the field, including players, goals, and the Bludger.
   - It processes each step of the game, updating the positions of players and balls based on the given actions.
   - The program correctly handles scoring when a player throws the Quaffle into the opposing team's goal and prints the appropriate messages.
   - The program also correctly handles player eliminations due to collisions with the Bludger and prints the elimination messages.
   - The final score is calculated and printed correctly.

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function calls. They confirm that the functions `func_1` and `func_2` operate as intended.
   - The overall flow of the program matches the problem description, and the annotations support the correctness of the program's behavior.

### Conclusion:

- The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correct for their respective tasks.
- The overall program logic correctly processes the game steps, updates the positions of players and balls, checks for scoring, and handles eliminations based on the Bludger interactions.
- The output formatting and final score calculation are also correct.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
