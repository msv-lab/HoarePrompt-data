Output State: **`obj` is a list of two integers where the second element is increased by 1, and d is 'R'**.

This means that the list `obj` originally had two integers representing a position on the field (row, column). After executing the code `obj[1] += 1`, the column value (second element) has been incremented by 1. The direction `d` remains unchanged as 'R'.
