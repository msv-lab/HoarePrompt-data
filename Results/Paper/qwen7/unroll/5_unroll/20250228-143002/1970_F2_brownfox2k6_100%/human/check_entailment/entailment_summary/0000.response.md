Reasoning:
1. **Initialization**: The code correctly initializes the field dimensions, goal positions, player positions, and the initial position of the Quaffle and Bludger.
2. **Game Steps Processing**: The code processes each step of the game correctly by handling movements, catching, and throwing actions. It updates the positions of players and the Quaffle accordingly.
3. **Elimination Handling**: The `func_2` function correctly identifies and eliminates players when they are in the same position as the Bludger.
4. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic is correct. When a player successfully scores in the opponent's goal, the appropriate team gets a point, and the Quaffle is reset to the center of the field.
5. **Output Order**: The events are printed in the correct order, with eliminations and goals processed and printed as required.
6. **Final Score**: The final score is correctly calculated and printed at the end of the game.

Given the above points, the provided code appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
