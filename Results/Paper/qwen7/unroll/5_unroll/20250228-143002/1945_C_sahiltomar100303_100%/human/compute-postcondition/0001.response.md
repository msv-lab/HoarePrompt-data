State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `_` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `_` is used in the loop head, but it is typically an underscore indicating that the variable is not used within the loop body. However, for the loop to execute, the value of `_` must be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.
2. The variable `t` is derived from user input and is specified to be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\). This means that `t` must be within this range for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only adjustments needed are ensuring that `t` is within the specified range and that `_` is initialized to 0.
