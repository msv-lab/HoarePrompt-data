The function processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of an integer \( n \) and a binary string \( s \) of length \( n \). For each test case, the function calculates the index of the first character from the left or right that ensures the number of zeros or ones on one side is less than half of the string length. The function then outputs this index. The function iterates through all test cases and prints the result for each one.
