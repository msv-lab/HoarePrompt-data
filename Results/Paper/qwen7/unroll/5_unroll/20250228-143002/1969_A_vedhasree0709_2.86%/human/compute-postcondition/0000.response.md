Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. However, since `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable (it's not used in the loop body), we don't need to adjust its value.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute based on the input provided by `int(input())`.
   - This input should be a non-negative integer.

3. **Consider the Given States:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - `p` is a list of \(n\) integers where each \(p_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\), \(p_i \neq i\), and all \(p_i\) are distinct.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop depends on the input from `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input is within the valid range for the loop to execute.
   - The valid range for the input is \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 5000\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, ensuring it falls within the valid range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and the input to `int(input())` must be within the range 1 to 5000**.
