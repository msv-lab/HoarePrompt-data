Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list `p` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index `i` in the list `p` such that `p[i] == i + 2` and `p[i + 1] == i + 1`. If such an index is found, it prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.**
