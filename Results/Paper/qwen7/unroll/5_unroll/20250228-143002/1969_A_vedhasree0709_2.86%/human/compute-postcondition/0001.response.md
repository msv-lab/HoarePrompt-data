Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct; the loop iterates through each test case, checking if there exists a pair (i, i+1) in the list l such that l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1. If such a pair is found, it prints 2 and sets j to 1, breaking out of the loop. If no such pair is found after checking all elements, it prints 3.
