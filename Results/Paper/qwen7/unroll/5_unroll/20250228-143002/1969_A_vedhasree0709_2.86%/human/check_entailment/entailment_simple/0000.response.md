Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The program checks only for the specific condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. However, the problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations such that at least 2 friends come to the party. This condition is much more complex and cannot be solved by just checking these specific values.

2. **Loop Boundaries**: The loop runs until `i <= n - 1`, which means it will check up to the second last element of the list. This is not sufficient because we need to consider all pairs of friends and their best friends.

3. **Handling All Test Cases**: The program does not handle all possible configurations of the input list `l`. For example, it fails to correctly identify cases where multiple pairs of friends need to be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

4. **Output for All Test Cases**: The program always prints either 2 or 3, but the actual output should vary based on the input configuration. For instance, in the third test case, the correct output should be 2, but the program incorrectly prints 3.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
