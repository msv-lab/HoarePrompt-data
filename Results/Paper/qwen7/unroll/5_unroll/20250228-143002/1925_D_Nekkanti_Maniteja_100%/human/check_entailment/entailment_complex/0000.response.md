Reasoning:

The annotated program seems to have some logical errors in its implementation. Let's break down the logic and see if the program correctly implements the problem statement.

1. **Initialization**: The program correctly initializes variables and reads the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Computation of `c`**: The variable `c` is computed as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\). This part is correct.

3. **Summation of `a`**: The variable `a` is intended to store the sum of the friendship values of all given pairs. However, the loop to compute `a` should iterate over all given pairs, not just the first `m` pairs. The current implementation only sums the first `m` pairs, which is incorrect.

4. **Calculation of `s`**: The formula used to calculate `s` is incorrect. The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions should consider the probability of choosing each pair. The current formula \( s = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left(c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a\right) \mod M \) does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

The correct approach involves calculating the expected value for each pair and summing these expected values. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        
        s = 0
        
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            s += f
        
        expected_value = (c * k * (k - 1) // 2 * c * m + c * k * s) % M
        
        print(expected_value)
```

This corrected version:
- Computes the modular inverse `c` correctly.
- Sums the friendship values `s` over all given pairs.
- Uses the correct formula to compute the expected value, considering the probability of choosing each pair.

Given the corrected logic, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
