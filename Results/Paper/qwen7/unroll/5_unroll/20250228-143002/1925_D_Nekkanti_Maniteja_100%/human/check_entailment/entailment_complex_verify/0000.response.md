### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step and compare it with the problem description and the example provided.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` as required.
   - It then reads `m` pairs of friends and their friendship values.

2. **Calculation of `c`**:
   - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of unique pairs `(n * (n - 1) // 2)` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - This is correct as it is used to normalize the probability of choosing any pair.

3. **Sum of Friendship Values (`a`)**:
   - The program sums up the friendship values of all given pairs.
   - This is also correct as it captures the initial sum of friendship values.

4. **Main Calculation Loop**:
   - The loop runs `k` times, and for each iteration, it adds to `s` the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - Here lies the issue:
     - `c * i * c * m` is intended to represent the contribution of the friendship values of pairs that have been chosen before.
     - `c * a` is intended to represent the contribution of the initial friendship values.
   - However, the program does not correctly simulate the increasing friendship values for pairs that are chosen repeatedly.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct.

### Example Analysis:

Let's take the example provided:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 3 2
  1 2 1
  2 3 2
  3 4 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for the two excursions is calculated as follows:
    - For the first excursion, the expected value is the average of the friendship values of all pairs, which is \(\frac{1+2+3+4+5}{5} = 3\).
    - For the second excursion, if the same pair is chosen, the friendship value increases by 1, so the expected value would be adjusted accordingly.
  - However, the program does not correctly handle this increase in friendship values and simply uses the initial friendship values without accounting for the increments.

#### Test Case 2:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 4 2
  1 2 1
  2 3 2
  3 4 3
  4 5 4
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - Similar to the previous case, the program does not correctly simulate the increasing friendship values.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly simulate the increasing friendship values for pairs that are chosen repeatedly. The current implementation assumes that the friendship values remain constant, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
