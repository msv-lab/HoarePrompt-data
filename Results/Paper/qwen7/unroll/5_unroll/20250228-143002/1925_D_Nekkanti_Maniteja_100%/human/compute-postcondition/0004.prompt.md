You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5. Each of the next m lines contains three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i such that a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. It is guaranteed that all pairs of friends are distinct, and the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        
        s = 0
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        
        print(s % M)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5. The value of `s` is calculated as \( s = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left(c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a\right) \mod M \), where \( c = \left(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\right)^{-1} \mod M \), and `a` is the sum of `f_i` values from the edges. The final output is the value of `s` modulo \( M \).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes integers t, n, m, and k, followed by m lines of three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. It returns information based on the given constraints and inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
