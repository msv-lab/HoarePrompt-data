### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and verify the solution step-by-step:

1. **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
   - The line `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` assumes that the total number of pairs \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) is coprime with \(M\). This is not necessarily true for all values of `n` and `M`. The modular inverse might not exist if \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) and \(M\) are not coprime. However, even if the modular inverse exists, the formula used in the program is still incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Formula:**
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. The expected value calculation should consider the probability of picking each pair and the effect of the friendship value increasing over time. Specifically, the expected value for each pair of friends being chosen in `k` excursions should be calculated correctly, taking into account the probability of being chosen and the increase in friendship value.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair of friends being chosen in `k` excursions. The correct approach involves the following steps:

1. **Calculate the Probability of Choosing Each Pair:**
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair in one excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).

2. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - For each pair of friends, the expected value of the friendship value after `k` excursions can be calculated as follows:
     - The probability of the pair being chosen in a single excursion is \(\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
     - The expected number of times the pair is chosen in `k` excursions is \(k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
     - The expected increase in the friendship value for each pair is \(k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \cdot f_i\).
   - Summing up the expected values for all pairs of friends gives the total expected value.

### Correct Implementation:

Here is a corrected implementation of the program:

```python
def func():
    import math

    def mod_inverse(x, mod):
        return pow(x, mod - 2, mod)

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        c = mod_inverse(total_pairs, M)
        s = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            s += f
        expected_value = (c * k * (k - 1) // 2 * m + c * k * s) % M
        print(expected_value)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Modular Inverse Function:**
   - A helper function `mod_inverse` is defined to compute the modular inverse.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `total_pairs` is calculated as \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - `c` is the modular inverse of `total_pairs` modulo \(M\).

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - `s` is initialized to 0 and is used to accumulate the sum of friendship values from all pairs of friends.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{expected\_value} = \left(c \cdot k \cdot \frac{k-1}{2} \cdot m + c \cdot k \cdot s\right) \mod M
     \]
   - This formula correctly accounts for the expected number of times each pair is chosen and the increase in friendship value.

### Final Evaluation:

Based on the analysis and the corrected implementation, the original program is incorrect due to the incorrect formula used. The corrected program accurately implements the solution.

Final: **False**
