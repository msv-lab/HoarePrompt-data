Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which are the number of children, the number of friend pairs, and the number of excursions respectively.
   - It also correctly calculates `M` as \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Calculation of `c`**:
   - The variable `c` is set to \((\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2})^{-1} \mod M\). This is the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible unordered pairs of children. This step is correct because it ensures that `c` can be used to scale the expected values correctly under modular arithmetic.

3. **Sum of Friendship Values (`a`)**:
   - The program correctly sums up the friendship values `f_i` for all given friend pairs. This sum is stored in the variable `a`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value calculation seems to be incorrect. The formula used in the loop is \( s = s + c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a \).
     - `c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m` should represent the contribution of the expected increase in friendship values due to the probability of picking a friend pair.
     - However, the term `c \cdot a` should not be added directly to `s` in each iteration. Instead, it should be scaled by the probability of picking a friend pair at each excursion, which is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{m \cdot c}{1}\).

5. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The program correctly applies the modulo operation at the end to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

Given the above points, the key issue lies in the incorrect formula used for the expected value calculation. The correct formula should account for the probability of picking a friend pair at each excursion, which is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{m \cdot c}{1}\).

Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
