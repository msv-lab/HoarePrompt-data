Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5. The value of `s` is calculated as \( s = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left(c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a\right) \mod M \), where \( c = \left(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\right)^{-1} \mod M \), and `a` is the sum of `f_i` values from the edges. The final output is the value of `s` modulo \( M \).
