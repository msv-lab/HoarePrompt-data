Output State: The output state will consist of a series of "YES" and "NO" based on the conditions evaluated for each string `s` provided in the loop. For each iteration, if the count of '1's in the string `s` is greater than 2 and even, it prints "YES". If the count of '1's is greater than 2 but odd, or if there are consecutive '1's ('11'), it prints "NO". If the count of '1's is exactly 1, it also prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".
