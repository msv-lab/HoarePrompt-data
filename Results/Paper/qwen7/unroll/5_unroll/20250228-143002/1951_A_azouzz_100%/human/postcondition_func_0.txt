The function processes multiple strings `s` (each representing a directory name) and prints "YES" or "NO" based on specific conditions related to the count of '1's in each string. For each string, if the count of '1's is greater than 2 and even, it prints "YES". If the count of '1's is greater than 2 but odd, or if there are consecutive '1's ('11'), it prints "NO". If the count of '1's is exactly 1, it also prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES". The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
