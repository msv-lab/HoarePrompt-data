Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50; `sorted_lst` is a sorted version of `lst`.**

The code sorts the list `lst` and assigns the sorted list to `sorted_lst`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged in terms of its content, but a new list `sorted_lst` is created which contains the elements of `lst` in ascending order. The conditions on the list `lst` (length between 2 and 50, integers between 0 and 99) still apply to both `lst` and `sorted_lst`.
