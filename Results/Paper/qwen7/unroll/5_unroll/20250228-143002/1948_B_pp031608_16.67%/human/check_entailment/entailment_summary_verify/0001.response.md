### Reasoning

The original assessment identified several issues with the provided program, but the analysis was incomplete and somewhat misleading. Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment

1. **Incorrect Logic in Main Loop:**
   - The main loop should check if the array is already sorted before attempting to modify it. The current logic incorrectly assumes that the array needs modification even if it is already sorted.
   - The function `func_1` is called after every iteration of the main loop, which is unnecessary and inefficient.

2. **Splitting Operation Implementation:**
   - The splitting operation is implemented correctly but is only applied when the previous element is greater than the current element and the previous element is at least 10.
   - However, the logic to handle the splitting and insertion is not robust enough to ensure the array can be made sorted.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as arrays with leading zeros or arrays that cannot be sorted by the given operations.

#### Corrected Program

The corrected program provided in the original assessment addresses some of these issues, but it still has some flaws. Here is a more detailed analysis:

1. **Initial Check for Sorted Array:**
   - The corrected program checks if the array is already sorted before entering the main loop. This is a good improvement over the original program.

2. **Main Loop Logic:**
   - The main loop attempts to sort the array by splitting elements. However, the logic to handle the splitting and insertion is still not robust enough to ensure the array can be made sorted.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The corrected program still does not handle edge cases such as arrays with leading zeros or arrays that cannot be sorted by the given operations.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Initial Check for Sorted Array:**
   - The initial check for whether the array is already sorted is a good optimization. However, it does not guarantee that the array can be sorted by the given operations.

2. **Main Loop Logic:**
   - The main loop attempts to sort the array by splitting elements. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the array can be made sorted. For example, consider the array `[10, 2]`. Splitting `10` results in `[1, 0, 2]`, which is not sorted.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as arrays with leading zeros or arrays that cannot be sorted by the given operations. For example, the array `[10, 11]` cannot be sorted by the given operations.

#### Correct Approach

A correct approach would involve a different strategy to determine if the array can be sorted by the given operations. One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm to repeatedly split elements until the array is sorted or it is determined that it cannot be sorted.

Here is a revised version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    while True:
        sorted_list = sorted(list1)
        if list1 == sorted_list:
            print('Yes')
            break
        
        modified = False
        for p in range(1, len(list1)):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] >= 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
                modified = True
                break
        
        if not modified:
            print('No')
            break
```

### Conclusion

The original program has logical issues and inefficiencies. The corrected program provided in the original assessment addresses some of these issues but still has flaws. A more robust approach is needed to ensure the array can be sorted by the given operations.

**Correctness:** False

**Final Evaluation:** **False**
