Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either the value of `a * b` or the rounded value of `a * d`, depending on whether `a * b` is less than `a * d`. The number of lines will be equal to the value of `n`. Each line's specific value depends on the input provided for each iteration of the loop.
