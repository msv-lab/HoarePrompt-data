Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Assignment**: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are correctly assigned from the input for each test case.
3. **Promotion Price Calculation**: The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which represents the price per yogurt when buying two yogurts under the promotion.
4. **Condition Check**: The program checks whether buying individual yogurts at price `a` is cheaper than buying them in pairs at the promotion price. This is done using the condition `if a * b < a * d`.
5. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, either `a * b` or `round(a * d)`.

However, there is a critical issue with the calculation of `d`. In the code, `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, but according to the problem statement, `c` should be `b` (the price for two yogurts on promotion). Therefore, the correct calculation should be `d = b / 2`.

Given this, the program does not correctly calculate the promotion price per yogurt. The corrected version should be:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = b / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

With this correction, the program will accurately calculate the minimum cost for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
