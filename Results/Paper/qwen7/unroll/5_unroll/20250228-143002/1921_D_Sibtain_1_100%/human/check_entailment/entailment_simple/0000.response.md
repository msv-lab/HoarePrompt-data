Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by arrays `a` and `b`. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program checks if both arrays `a` and `b` contain identical elements. If they do, it prints `0` immediately, which is correct because no difference can be achieved.

3. **Sorting**: Both arrays `a` and `b` are sorted. Array `a` is sorted in ascending order, and array `b` is sorted in descending order. This is a key step as it ensures that the largest possible differences are considered when pairing elements from `a` and `b`.

4. **Pairing Elements**: The program pairs the smallest element of `a` with the largest element of `b`, the second smallest element of `a` with the second largest element of `b`, and so on. This maximizes the absolute differences between corresponding elements, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the total difference `D`.

5. **Calculation of Differences**: The program calculates the maximum difference for each pair and sums them up. This approach ensures that the total difference `D` is maximized.

6. **Output**: The program outputs the calculated `ans` for each test case, which is the total difference `D`.

Given the above points, the program logic appears to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
