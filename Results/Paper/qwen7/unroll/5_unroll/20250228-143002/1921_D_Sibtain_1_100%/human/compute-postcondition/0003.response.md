Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), followed by pairs of positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5) such that the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 × 10^5, and pairs of integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9) for each n. The function returns results based on the processed test cases.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each starting with an integer t indicating the number of subsequent pairs of integers (n, m) and (a_i, b_i). The function processes these inputs and produces some form of output based on the given constraints and data, though the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.
