Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a tuple containing an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, n is even) and two strings, each of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'**.

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `results`. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged from their initial state.
