Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) is flawed. Here's an example where the program does not work as expected:

Consider the following input:
```
4
6
<>><><
><<>><
```

In this case, the robot starts at (1, 1). It can move right to (1, 2) and then follow the arrow to (2, 2). From (2, 2), it can move right to (2, 3) and then follow the arrow to (1, 3). From (1, 3), it can move right to (1, 4) and then follow the arrow to (2, 4). Finally, from (2, 4), it can move right to (2, 5) and then follow the arrow to (1, 5). From (1, 5), it can move right to (1, 6) and then follow the arrow to (2, 6).

However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" for this case because it only checks if the robot can reach (2, n) directly from (1, 1) or through a series of moves that do not necessarily cover all possible paths.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the robot can reach (2, n) through a valid sequence of moves, considering all possible paths. The current implementation only checks a limited set of conditions and does not account for all possible valid paths.
