The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (between 2 and 2â‹…10^5, inclusive, and even), and two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. It processes each test case to determine if the second string can be reached from the first string following specific rules. If the second string can be reached, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. The function returns the resulting list of 'YES' and 'NO' values.
