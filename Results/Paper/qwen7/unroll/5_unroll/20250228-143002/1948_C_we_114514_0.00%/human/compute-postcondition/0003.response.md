Output State: `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the second row can be reached from the first row following the rules defined in the loop. If `reachable_second_row` becomes `True` for a test case, 'YES' is appended to `results`; otherwise, 'NO' is appended.
