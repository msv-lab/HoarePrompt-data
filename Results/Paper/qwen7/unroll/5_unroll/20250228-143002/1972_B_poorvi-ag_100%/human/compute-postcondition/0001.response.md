Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` remains a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", and `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive); `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the values of `t`, `s`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
