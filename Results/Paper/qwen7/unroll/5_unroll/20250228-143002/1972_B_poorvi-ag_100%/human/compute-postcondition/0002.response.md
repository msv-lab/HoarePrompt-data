State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `s` remains a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `n` must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0** 

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0 because `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`.
- The strings `s` and `n` remain unchanged and must meet their specified conditions.
- The list `results` remains empty as given.
- `i` is set to 0 at the beginning of the loop.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are to ensure `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is initialized to 0.
