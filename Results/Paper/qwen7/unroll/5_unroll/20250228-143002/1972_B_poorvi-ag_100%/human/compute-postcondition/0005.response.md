Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in results:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `results`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `results`**: The problem statement mentions that `t` integers are appended to the `results` list. This means that `results` is a list containing `t` elements.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the `results` list. Since `results` contains `t` integers, the loop will execute `t` times, once for each integer in the list.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute properly. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `results`. The variable `i` will take on the value of each element in `results` during each iteration, but its initial state is not directly controllable from outside the loop.

5. **Formulate the Final State**: Given that `results` is a list of `t` integers, we need to ensure that `results` is indeed a list with `t` integers.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`results` is a list of `t` integers**
