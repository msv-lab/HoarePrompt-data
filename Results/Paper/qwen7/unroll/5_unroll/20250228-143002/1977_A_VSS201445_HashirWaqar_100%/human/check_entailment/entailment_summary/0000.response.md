Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic required to determine if it's possible for Nikita to have exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Conditions Check**: For each test case, the program checks two conditions:
   - \( n \geq m \): This ensures that there are enough moves to potentially achieve the desired number of cubes.
   - \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \): This condition ensures that the difference between \( n \) and \( m \) is even. Since each move can either add or remove one cube, the total change in the number of cubes must be even to reach an exact count of \( m \) cubes from \( n \) moves.

Given these points, the program accurately determines whether it's possible to have exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves based on the provided problem description.

Correctness: **True**
