Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where the first element is the number of sticks available (n), and the subsequent elements are the lengths of the sticks (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The function returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 3, where each frequency is the count of occurrences of a unique stick length in the original list.**
