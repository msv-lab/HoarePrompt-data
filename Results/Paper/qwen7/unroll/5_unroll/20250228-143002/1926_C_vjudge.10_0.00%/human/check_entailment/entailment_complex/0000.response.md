Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to \( n \).
2. The provided code does not correctly implement the solution. It reads \( N \) test cases but then iterates up to \( N \) instead of iterating up to \( n \) for each test case.
3. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given number \( n \).
4. However, the main loop should iterate from 1 to \( n \) for each test case, not from 0 to \( N-1 \).

Given the above points, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not properly handle the input for each test case and does not sum the digits of all numbers from 1 to \( n \) for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
