Output State: **The program returns the sum of the digits of the integer n, where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.**

This means that the program converts the integer `n` into a string, iterates over each digit, converts each digit back to an integer, and sums these integers. The result is the sum of the digits of `n`.
