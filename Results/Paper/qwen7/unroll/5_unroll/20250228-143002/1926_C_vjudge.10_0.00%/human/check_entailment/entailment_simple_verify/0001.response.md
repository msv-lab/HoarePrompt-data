### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Problem Description Recap
- Vladislav writes the integers from 1 to \( n \) on the board.
- Each integer is replaced with the sum of its digits.
- We need to find the sum of these new values.

#### Given Program Recap
```python
soma = 0
N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))
```

#### Annotated Code Recap
- `soma` is initialized to 0.
- `N` is read from input, but it is not used in the loop.
- For each test case, `n` is read from input.
- A loop runs from 0 to \( n-1 \), calling `func_1(i)` for each value of `i`.
- `func_1` computes the sum of the digits of the integer `n`.

#### Correctness Analysis
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - `soma` is correctly initialized to 0.
   - `N` is read from input, but it is not used in the loop, which is unnecessary.
   - For each test case, `n` is read from input.

2. **Loop and Function Call:**
   - The loop runs from 0 to \( n-1 \), calling `func_1(i)` for each value of `i`.
   - `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of `i`.

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum of the digits of each integer from 0 to \( n-1 \) is added to `soma`.

#### Example Walkthrough
- For \( n = 12 \):
  - The loop runs from 0 to 11.
  - `func_1(0)` returns 0.
  - `func_1(1)` returns 1.
  - `func_1(2)` returns 2.
  - ...
  - `func_1(11)` returns 1 + 1 = 2.
  - The sum is \( 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 46 \).

However, according to the problem, we should be summing the digits of the integers from 1 to 12, not from 0 to 11. The correct sum should be:
- `func_1(1)` returns 1.
- `func_1(2)` returns 2.
- ...
- `func_1(12)` returns 1 + 2 = 3.
- The sum is \( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 51 \).

#### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem. It processes the integers from 0 to \( n-1 \) instead of from 1 to \( n \). Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

**Final: False**
