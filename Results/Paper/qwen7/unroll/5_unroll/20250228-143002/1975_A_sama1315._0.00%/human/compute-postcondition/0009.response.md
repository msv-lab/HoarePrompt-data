Based on the initial state provided:

- `index` is explicitly given as 6.
- `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`. Since the value of `data[0]` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `t`.
- `results` is a list containing the results of calling `func_1` on each array slice defined by `data[index:index + n]`. Here, `index` is 6, so the slices would be `data[6:n]`. Without knowing the exact value of `n` and the contents of `data`, we cannot determine the exact elements in `results`.

Given this information, the print statement will join the elements of the `results` list with newline characters and print them out. Since we don't have the exact values of `data` and `n`, we can only describe the process.

Output: **the results of calling func_1 on each slice of data from index 6 to n, separated by newlines**
