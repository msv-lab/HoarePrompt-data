### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. `func_1` should check if the array is already non-decreasing. If not, it should use `func_2` to process multiple test cases.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it uses `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))` to check if there is at least one pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next one.
     - If such a pair exists, it returns 'No'.
     - If no such pair exists, it returns 'Yes'.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
   - It reads the total number of test cases (`t`), then for each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself.
   - It calls `func_1` for each array and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results, one per line.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - `func_1` correctly identifies if an array is already sorted or if it can be sorted by a single swap operation. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. The function only checks if the array is already sorted or if there is exactly one pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next one. It does not account for the possibility of sorting the array through multiple swaps.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 3, 2]`. The function would return 'No' because there is one pair `(3, 2)` where the current element is greater than the next one. However, this array can be sorted by swapping the prefix `[1, 3]` with the suffix `[2]` to get `[2, 1, 3]`, and then swapping again to get `[1, 2, 3]`.

5. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic flow of the program.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` is incorrect. It only checks for a single swap operation but does not handle more complex scenarios where multiple swaps might be needed to sort the array.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because `func_1` does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by any number of swap operations. It only checks for a single swap operation, which is insufficient for the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
