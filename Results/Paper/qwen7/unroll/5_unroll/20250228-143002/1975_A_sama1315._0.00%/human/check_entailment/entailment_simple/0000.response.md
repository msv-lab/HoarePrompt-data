### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function checks if the given array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns `'Yes'`.
   - Otherwise, it checks if reversing the array (which is equivalent to splitting the array into two parts and swapping them) would make the array sorted. If the reversed array is sorted, it returns `'Yes'`. Otherwise, it returns `'No'`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It calls `func_1` on each array and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results, each separated by a newline.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.
   - The provided examples match the expected behavior of the functions.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

### Correctness:
**True**
