Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function checks if the given array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If there is at least one pair of consecutive elements where the first is greater than the second, it returns 'No'.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` has a flaw. It should return 'No' if there is any pair of consecutive elements where the first is greater than the second, but instead, it returns 'Yes' in this case. This is incorrect because the array cannot be split and rearranged to be sorted if there is any such pair.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles reading the number of test cases (`t`), the length of the array (`n`), and the array elements (`arr`).
   - It then calls `func_1` on each array and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results, one per line.

3. **Overall Program Correctness:**
   - The issue lies in `func_1`. Since `func_1` incorrectly returns 'Yes' when it should return 'No', the entire program will give incorrect outputs for cases where the array cannot be sorted by splitting and rearranging.
   - The examples provided in the problem statement show that `func_1` should return 'No' for cases like `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]` and 'Yes' for cases like `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`.

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly identify arrays that cannot be sorted by the specified operation.

Correctness: **False**
