### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. `func_2` should handle multiple test cases, and for each test case, it should call `func_1` to check if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it uses `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))` to check if there is at least one pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next one.
     - If such a pair exists, it returns 'No'.
     - If no such pair exists, it returns 'Yes'.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
   - It reads the total number of test cases (`t`), then for each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself.
   - It calls `func_1` for each array and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results, one per line.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - `func_1` correctly identifies if an array is already sorted or if it can be sorted by a single swap operation.
   - However, `func_1` does not account for the possibility of sorting the array through multiple swaps. The provided logic only checks if the array is already sorted or if it can be sorted with a single swap. It does not consider the possibility of sorting the array through multiple swaps as described in the problem statement.

Given the problem statement, `func_1` is incomplete because it does not handle the scenario where the array can be sorted through multiple swaps. The function should check if the array can be split and swapped in such a way that it becomes non-decreasing.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because `func_1` does not correctly handle the scenario where the array can be sorted through multiple swaps. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
