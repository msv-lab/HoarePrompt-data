Output State: `buffer` is a list containing the results of each iteration of the loop. Each result is calculated based on the input values of `n` and `w` for each iteration, and printed according to the conditions specified in the loop body. If `n < 3`, the output is `0`. If `n >= 3`, the output is calculated using the formulae provided, considering the frequency of each unique element in the list `w`.
