### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly initializes the field dimensions \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It parses the initial state of the field, including players, goals, and the Quaffle's position.
   - The program correctly identifies the middle of the field and stores it in `middle`.

2. **Movement and Action Handling:**
   - The program handles movements (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`) correctly by updating the positions of players and the Bludger.
   - It correctly handles the catching of the Quaffle (`C` action) by updating the `quidditch` variable.
   - The throwing of the Quaffle (`T` action) is handled correctly by resetting the `quidditch` variable and updating the score if the Quaffle is thrown into the opponent's goal.

3. **Elimination Handling:**
   - The program correctly identifies when a player is eliminated due to collision with a Bludger and prints the appropriate message.
   - The elimination messages are printed in the correct order (alphabetically for players).

4. **Scoring and Final Score Calculation:**
   - The program correctly updates the score when a player successfully scores in the opponent's goal.
   - The final score is printed in the correct format.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as multiple balls in the same cell and the Bludger eliminating a player correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly based on the provided problem description and examples.

### Correctness:

**True**
