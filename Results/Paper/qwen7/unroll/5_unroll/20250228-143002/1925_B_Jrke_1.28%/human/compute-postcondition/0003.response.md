Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three integers: t, x, and n, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, and 1 ≤ n ≤ x. Based on these values, the function returns either an integer or a specific value depending on the conditions met.**

This means the function indirectly accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `n`, all of which are integers with specified ranges. The function then processes these values and returns a result based on certain conditions, though the exact nature of the return value (an integer or another type) and the conditions under which it returns different values are not detailed here.
