You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving three integers \( t \), \( x \), and \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the maximum divisor of \( x \) that is less than or equal to \( x // n \). If \( x // n = 1 \), it prints 1. Otherwise, it iterates through possible divisors of \( x \), checks if they are valid based on the condition, and keeps track of the maximum valid divisor. Finally, it prints the maximum valid divisor found for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.

2. **Initial Calculation:**
   - It calculates `k = x // n`, which gives the minimum difficulty per sub-problem if all sub-problems had the same difficulty.
   - If `k == 1`, it prints `1` and continues to the next test case. This is because if the minimum difficulty is `1`, the maximum balance is `1`.

3. **Finding Maximum Balance:**
   - The program then tries to find the maximum balance by iterating over odd numbers from `1` to `sqrt(x)` (inclusive).
   - For each odd number `i` that divides `x`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, it considers `i` as a potential balance.
     - If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, it considers `x // i` as a potential balance.
   - It keeps track of the maximum balance found in the variable `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the maximum balance `ans` for each test case.

### Reasoning:

1. **Handling `k == 1`:**
   - When `k == 1`, the program correctly prints `1`. This is because the smallest possible difficulty for each sub-problem is `1`, and the GCD of multiple `1`s is `1`.

2. **Odd Divisors Check:**
   - The program iterates over odd numbers up to `sqrt(x)` to find divisors. This is efficient because any divisor larger than `sqrt(x)` would have a corresponding smaller divisor.
   - Considering only odd numbers ensures that we do not miss any potential divisors and simplifies the logic.

3. **Balance Calculation:**
   - The program correctly checks both `i` and `x // i` as potential balances when they are within the limit `k`.
   - This ensures that the maximum balance is found by considering all possible ways to split `x` into `n` parts.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like `k == 1` correctly.
   - It also correctly identifies the maximum balance by checking all relevant divisors.

### Conclusion:

The given program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem. It efficiently finds the maximum balance by considering all relevant divisors and ensuring the constraints are met.

Correctness: **True**
