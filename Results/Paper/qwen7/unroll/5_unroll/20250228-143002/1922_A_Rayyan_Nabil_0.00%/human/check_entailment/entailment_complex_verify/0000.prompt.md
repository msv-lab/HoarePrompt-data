You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, and c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `l` is determined based on the comparison of strings `a`, `b`, and `c` for each index within the range of `n`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
    #
    #In this output state, the variable `l` will be set to 'NO' if for any value of `i` in the range of `n`, the characters at the same index in strings `a`, `b`, and `c` do not satisfy the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]`. Otherwise, `l` will be set to 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it compares the characters at each index of strings a, b, and c. If for any index i, the characters in a and c are different and the characters in b and c are also different, it sets the variable l to 'YES'. Otherwise, it sets l to 'NO'. After processing all test cases, it prints the value of l for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Specifically, the program sets `l` to `'YES'` as soon as it finds a character in `a` and `b` that does not match the corresponding character in `c`. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not ensure that both `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
2
aa
bb
ab
```

The program will output "YES", but according to the problem description, there is no template that satisfies the conditions for this input. Both `a` and `b` would need to match the template, and `c` would need to not match it. In this case, if we use the template "AA", both `a` and `b` match, but `c` also matches, so the program incorrectly outputs "YES".

To fix this, the program needs to check if both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not match the template after constructing the template based on the characters in `a`, `b`, and `c`.
