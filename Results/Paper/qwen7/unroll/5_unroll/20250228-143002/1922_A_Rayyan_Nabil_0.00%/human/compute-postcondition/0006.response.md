Functionality: The function processes up to 1000 test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 20), and three strings \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), each of length \( n \). It then checks if for every index \( i \) in the range of \( n \), either \( a[i] \neq c[i] \) or \( b[i] \neq c[i] \). If this condition holds for all indices, the function sets a variable \( l \) to 'YES'; otherwise, it sets \( l \) to 'NO'. Finally, the function prints the value of \( l \) for each test case.
