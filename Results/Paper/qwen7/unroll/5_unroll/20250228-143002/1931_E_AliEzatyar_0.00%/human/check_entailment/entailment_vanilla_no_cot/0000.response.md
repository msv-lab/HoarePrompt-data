Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining the winner based on the rules of the game:

1. **Function `func_1` Usage**: The function `func_1` is used to count trailing zeros in a number, but it is not called correctly in the main logic. The variable `zeros` should store the number of trailing zeros for each number, but `func_1` is not being used properly.

2. **Logic for Determining Winner**: The logic for determining the winner is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:` does not accurately reflect the game's rules. The game involves digit reversal by Anna and concatenation by Sasha, and the winning condition is based on the final number being at least \(10^m\).

3. **Handling Game Rules**: The program does not simulate the actual game turns where players take turns reversing digits and concatenating numbers. Instead, it tries to predict the outcome based on a static analysis of the initial list, which is insufficient.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to simulate the game turns and follow the rules strictly. Here is a more accurate approach:

```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test

def reverse_number(num):
    return int(str(num)[::-1].lstrip('0'))

def can_sasha_win(array, m):
    while len(array) > 1:
        # Anna's turn: Reverse a number
        if len(array) == 2:
            # Sasha can only concatenate two numbers
            return False
        else:
            # Anna reverses a number
            array[0] = reverse_number(array[0])
        
        # Sasha's turn: Concatenate two numbers
        if len(array) < 2:
            return True
        else:
            # Sasha concatenates two numbers
            array[-2] = str(array[-2]) + str(array[-1])
            array.pop()

    # Check if the final number is at least 10^m
    return int(array[0]) >= 10**m

for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if can_sasha_win(array, m):
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'

for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

This code simulates the game turns and checks if Sasha can force a win based on the rules provided.
