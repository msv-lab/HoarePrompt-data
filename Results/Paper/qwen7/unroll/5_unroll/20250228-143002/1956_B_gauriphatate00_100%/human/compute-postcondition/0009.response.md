Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: a list 'a' containing n integers, where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list. It returns max_score, which is the number of integers from 1 to n that appear exactly twice in the list 'a'.**
