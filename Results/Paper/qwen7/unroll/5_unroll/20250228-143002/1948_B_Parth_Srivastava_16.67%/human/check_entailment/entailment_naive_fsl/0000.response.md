Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the splitting of numbers greater than 10 and reinserting their digits in the correct order. Here's an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
3
3
12 28 5
```

Expected output:
```
YES
```

However, the program will output:
```
NO
```

This is because the program incorrectly handles the splitting and reordering of digits. For instance, when processing `12`, it splits it into `1` and `2` and appends them to the list. However, it does not ensure that these digits are inserted in the correct positions to maintain the non-decreasing order. The program should check if the resulting array after splitting and reordering can be sorted, but it does not do so effectively. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
