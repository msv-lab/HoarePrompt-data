#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the original string `a` and converting each part to an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is the total number of elements added to list `c` after processing all elements in `a`, `c` is a list of integers where integers greater than 10 have been processed according to the given rules, `d` is a list of integers which is a sorted version of list `c`, `b` is a list containing either the integer 0 or 1 depending on whether `c` is equal to `d` or not.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). For each integer greater than 10 in the list `a`, it extracts the last digit and the preceding digit, then appends them to a new list `c` according to specific rules. After processing all integers, it sorts the list `c` and checks if `c` is equal to its sorted version. If they are equal, it appends 1 to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0. The function ultimately returns the list `b`.
