Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the original string `a` and converting each part to an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is the total number of elements added to list `c` after processing all elements in `a`, `c` is a list of integers where integers greater than 10 have been processed according to the given rules, `d` is a list of integers which is a sorted version of list `c`, `b` is a list containing either the integer 0 or 1 depending on whether `c` is equal to `d` or not.**
