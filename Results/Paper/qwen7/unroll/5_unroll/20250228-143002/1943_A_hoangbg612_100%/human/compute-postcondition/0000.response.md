Output State: **`T` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2⋅10^4.**

The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), the same condition applies to the new variable `T` after the code execution. All other variables remain unchanged.
