Output State: T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10^4. After all the executions of the loop have finished, for each input case, the variable `cur` holds the second smallest number that appears exactly once in the sorted list `N`, or the smallest number that appears more than once if no unique second smallest number exists.
