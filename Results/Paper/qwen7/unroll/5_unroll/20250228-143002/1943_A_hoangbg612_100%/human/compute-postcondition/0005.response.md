Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( T \) (number of test cases), an integer \( N \) (length of the array), and an array of \( N \) integers. For each test case, it sorts the array and then identifies the second smallest number that appears exactly once in the sorted array. If no such number exists, it finds the smallest number that appears more than once. The function outputs the identified number for each test case.**
