You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and an array a of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        N.sort()
        
        cur = -1
        
        M = {}
        
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
            cur += 1
        
        cnt = []
        
        for k in M.keys():
            if M[k] == 1:
                cnt.append(k)
        
        if len(cnt) >= 2:
            cur = cnt[1]
        
        print(cur)
        
    #State: Output State: T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10^4. After all the executions of the loop have finished, for each input case, the variable `cur` holds the second smallest number that appears exactly once in the sorted list `N`, or the smallest number that appears more than once if no unique second smallest number exists.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases, each containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and an array a of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. For each test case, it returns either an error message if t is not within the specified range or an analysis of the array a based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
