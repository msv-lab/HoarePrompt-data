Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder variable) and the integer `T`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `T` is greater than 0. Since `T` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), the loop will always execute as long as `T` is within this range.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means `T` should be set to a value within its valid range. Since `T` is already described as a positive integer, we don't need to change its value; however, we need to explicitly state that `T` is within the specified range.

Given the above steps, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\)**.
