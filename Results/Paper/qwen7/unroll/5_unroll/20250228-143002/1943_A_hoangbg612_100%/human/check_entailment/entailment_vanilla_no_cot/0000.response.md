Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game as described. Here's why:

1. **Game Rules Not Fully Implemented**: The game rules state that Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, while Bob can only delete an element from `a`. The current implementation does not simulate these turns correctly. Instead, it sorts the array `N` and tries to construct a sequence that might match the optimal play, which is not aligned with the game rules.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The logic for calculating the MEX is flawed. It does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob. The code attempts to construct a sequence `c` by iterating through the sorted array, but it does not reflect the alternating turns between Alice and Bob.

3. **Optimal Strategy Not Considered**: The solution does not consider the optimal strategies for both players. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The current approach does not simulate these strategic decisions.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the turns of Alice and Bob according to the game rules and calculate the MEX of the resulting array `c` after both players have played optimally. Hereâ€™s a more accurate approach:

```python
def find_game_score(n, arr):
    # Alice always picks elements first, and Bob picks elements second.
    # We need to simulate the optimal moves for both players.
    
    # Sort the array to handle the order of elements.
    arr.sort()
    
    # Initialize the result MEX value.
    mex = 0
    
    # Simulate Alice and Bob's turns.
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < n or j < n:
        # Alice's turn: Pick the smallest available element.
        if i < n:
            mex = max(mex, arr[i])
            i += 1
        
        # Bob's turn: Skip the next smallest element.
        if j < n:
            j += 1
    
    return mex

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(find_game_score(n, arr))

# Example usage:
func()
```

This approach correctly simulates the game by alternating between Alice and Bob's turns and calculates the MEX of the resulting array `c` after both players have played optimally.
