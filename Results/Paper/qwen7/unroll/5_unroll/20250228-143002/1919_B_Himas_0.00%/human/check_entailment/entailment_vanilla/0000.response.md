Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the minimum possible penalty based on the given rules.
2. The provided function `func()` does not correctly implement the solution. Here's why:
   - It reads an integer `s` which should be the length of the string, but it is actually reading the length as an integer and not using it.
   - It reads the string `e`, but then it calculates the difference between the count of '+' and '-' directly without splitting the array into optimal subarrays.
   - The logic for calculating the minimum penalty is missing. The current implementation just counts the number of '+' and '-' and prints their difference, which is not related to the penalty calculation described in the problem.

Given these points, the provided function does not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
