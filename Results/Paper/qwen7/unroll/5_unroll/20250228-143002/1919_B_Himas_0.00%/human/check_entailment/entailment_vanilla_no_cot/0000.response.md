Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The logic in the given function simply counts the number of '+' and '-' in the string `e` and calculates the difference between these counts (`P - M`). This approach does not account for the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the penalty.

To solve this problem correctly, one needs to consider the optimal way to split the array `a` into segments such that the total penalty is minimized. A more appropriate approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal splits. The current solution does not achieve this and thus is incorrect.
