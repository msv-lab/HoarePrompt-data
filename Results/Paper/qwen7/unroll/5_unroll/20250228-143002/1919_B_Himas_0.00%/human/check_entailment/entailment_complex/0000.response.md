Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The problem requires calculating the minimum possible penalty based on the optimal way to split the array `a` derived from the string `s`. However, the current implementation simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` and outputs their difference. This approach does not consider the optimal splitting of the array `a` to minimize the penalty.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to consider all possible ways to split the array `a` and compute the penalty for each split, then choose the split with the minimum penalty. The current implementation does not achieve this.

Correctness: **False**
