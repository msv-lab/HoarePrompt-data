The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. It then calculates and prints the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s`. The function implicitly accepts inputs through variables `t`, `n`, and `s`, and does not return any value explicitly.
