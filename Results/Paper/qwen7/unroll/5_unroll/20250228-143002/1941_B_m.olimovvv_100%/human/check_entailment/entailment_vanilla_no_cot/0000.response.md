Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Operation Implementation**: The solution attempts to reduce the array elements based on a different operation than specified. The problem requires reducing `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by specific amounts when choosing an index `i`. However, the solution incorrectly modifies the array in a way that doesn't align with the problem statement.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The loop iterates through the array and checks if any element is negative before performing operations. If an element is found to be negative, it prints 'NO' and breaks the loop. This approach is flawed because it doesn't guarantee that all elements can be reduced to zero, and it doesn't correctly simulate the allowed operations.

3. **Final Check**: Even if the loop completes without finding a negative element, the final check (`if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0`) is insufficient. It only checks the last two elements, but the problem requires checking if all elements can be reduced to zero.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the sum of the array elements is even (since each operation reduces three elements by a total of 4). Additionally, we need to ensure that the array can be reduced to all zeros by repeatedly applying the allowed operations.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is divisible by 4
        if sum(arr) % 4 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if the maximum value in the array is greater than the sum of the rest
        max_val = max(arr)
        if max_val > sum(arr) - max_val:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        print('YES')

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution first checks if the sum of the array is divisible by 4. If not, it's impossible to reduce all elements to zero. Then, it checks if the maximum value in the array is not larger than the sum of the rest of the elements, ensuring that the largest element can be reduced to zero along with the others. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES'.
