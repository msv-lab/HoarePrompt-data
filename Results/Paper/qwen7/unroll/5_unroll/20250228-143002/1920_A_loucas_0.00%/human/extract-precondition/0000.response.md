Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, each test case contains n constraints where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.**
