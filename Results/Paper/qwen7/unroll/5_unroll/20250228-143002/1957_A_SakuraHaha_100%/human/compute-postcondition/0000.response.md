Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and we read the first input which is an integer representing `n`.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input for `n`, which is within the specified range. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 100. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the input integer, which is also within the specified range.
