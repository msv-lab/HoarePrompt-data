Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers based on the given constraints. It returns a value based on the conditions specified for the list of integers.**

In natural language: The function `func_1` does not accept any direct parameters. Instead, it processes a list of integers based on the constraints that for each test case, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and the list contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` each between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The function returns a value based on the conditions specified for this list of integers.
