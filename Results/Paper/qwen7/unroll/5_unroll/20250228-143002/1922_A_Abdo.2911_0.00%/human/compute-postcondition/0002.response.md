Output State: The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified in the code. For each input 'n', strings 'a', 'b', and 'c' of length 'n' are processed to generate a template string. If the template matches 'a' and 'b' but not 'c', 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The output state will be a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' corresponding to each input set within the range specified by 't'.
