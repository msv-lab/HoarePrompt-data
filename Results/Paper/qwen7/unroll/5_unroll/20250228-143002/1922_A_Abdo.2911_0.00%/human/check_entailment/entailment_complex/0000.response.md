Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. It reads the length of the strings (`n`) and the three strings (`a`, `b`, `c`) as required.

2. **Template Construction**: The template is constructed by comparing characters of `a` and `b`. If the characters are the same, the character from `a` is added to the template. If they differ, the character from `a` is converted to uppercase and added to the template. This ensures that the template respects the constraints given in the problem.

3. **Matching Conditions**:
   - For `a` and `b` to match the template, if the template character is lowercase, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` must match the template character. If the template character is uppercase, neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` should match the lowercase version of the template character.
   - For `c` to not match the template, if the template character is lowercase, `c[i]` must not match the template character. If the template character is uppercase, `c[i]` must match the lowercase version of the template character.

4. **Output Determination**: Based on the matching conditions, the program prints "YES" if `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, and "NO" otherwise.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all edge cases as per the problem statement, including when `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same or different, and when `c[i]` should or should not match the template.

Given the above points, the program accurately follows the problem requirements and correctly determines the output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
