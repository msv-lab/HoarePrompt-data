Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
2. The provided solution correctly identifies that the cost for a '0' is the count of consecutive '1's before it plus one.
3. The function iterates through the string `s`, maintaining a count of consecutive '1's (`one`). When a '0' is encountered, it adds `one + 1` to the total cost and resets `one`.
4. This approach ensures that each '0' is considered in relation to the '1's immediately preceding it, which is the correct logic for determining the minimum cost.
5. The function correctly returns the total cost after processing the entire string.

Given the logic and the implementation, the function accurately calculates the minimum cost as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
