### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
   - A cyclic shift of a substring `s[l:r]` costs `r - l + 1`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls a function `func_1(s)` and prints the result.
   - The function `func_1(s)` calculates the cost to sort the string `s`.

3. **Function `func_1(s)` Analysis:**
   - It initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments `one`.
     - If the character is '0' and there has been at least one '1' (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to `cost`.
   - This logic seems to be an attempt to count the number of "blocks" of zeros that need to be moved past ones to sort the string.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1(s)` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for cyclic shifts.
   - The approach of counting blocks of zeros and adding `one + 1` does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts.
   - For example, consider the string "101011":
     - The correct solution would involve multiple cyclic shifts, but the current logic would incorrectly compute the cost as 9.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - Let's verify with the provided examples:
     - For "10", the correct cost is 2 (shift the entire string).
     - For "0000", the correct cost is 0 (already sorted).
     - For "11000", the correct cost is 9 (as explained in the note).
     - For "101011", the correct cost is 5 (not 9).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided function `func_1(s)` does not correctly compute the minimum cost for cyclic shifts to sort the string.

### Correctness:
**False**
