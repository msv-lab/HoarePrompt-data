Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Specifically, consider the input string `101011`. According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would involve multiple cyclic shifts to sort the string, but the current implementation does not account for this.

Here is a detailed breakdown of why the program fails:

1. The program counts the number of '0's that appear after a '1' and adds the count plus one to the cost. This approach does not capture the full complexity of finding the minimum cost to sort the string through cyclic shifts.

2. For the string `101011`, the program would incorrectly calculate the cost as follows:
   - First '1' at index 0: no preceding '0's, so cost = 0.
   - Second '1' at index 3: three preceding '0's, so cost = 3 + 1 = 4.
   - Third '1' at index 5: two preceding '0's, so cost = 2 + 1 = 3.
   - Total cost = 0 + 4 + 3 = 7.

However, the optimal solution involves the following steps:
   - Choose the substring `[3, 5]` (cost = 3): `101011` → `101101`.
   - Choose the substring `[1, 2]` (cost = 2): `101101` → `011101`.
   - Choose the substring `[0, 0]` (cost = 1): `011101` → `001111`.

The total cost is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6, which is less than the 7 calculated by the program.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all cases and thus is incorrect.
