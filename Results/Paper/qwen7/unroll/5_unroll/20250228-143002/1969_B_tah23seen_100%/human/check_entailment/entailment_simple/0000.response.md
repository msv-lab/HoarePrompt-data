### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring shifted.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided code defines a function `func_1(s)` that calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string `s`.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and counts the number of consecutive '1's (`one`) until it encounters a '0'. When a '0' is encountered, it adds the count of '1's plus one to the cost (`cost += one + 1`).
   - This approach works because each '0' that breaks a sequence of '1's needs to be moved to the front of the sequence of '1's, which can be achieved by a cyclic shift of the appropriate length.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string consists entirely of '0's, no operations are needed, and the cost is 0.
   - If the string consists entirely of '1's, no operations are needed, and the cost is 0.
   - If the string starts with '0's followed by '1's, the cost is calculated correctly by counting the '1's and adding one for each '0' that breaks the sequence of '1's.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1(s)` correctly identifies the points where '0's break sequences of '1's and calculates the cost accordingly.
   - The function handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
