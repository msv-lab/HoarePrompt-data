Output State: **`inpstr` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'.**

The code `inpstr = input()` reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `inpstr`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.
