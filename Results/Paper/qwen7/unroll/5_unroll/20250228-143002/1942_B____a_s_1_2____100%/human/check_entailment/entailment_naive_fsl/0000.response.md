Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a permutation \( p \) that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the values of \( p \) is flawed. Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

### Example Input:
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

### Expected Output:
A valid permutation \( p \) could be `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]` as mentioned in the example.

### Program Output:
Let's walk through the program step-by-step for the given input:

1. Initialize `t`, `n`, and read the array `a`.
2. Create an array `p` of size `n` initialized to `-1`.
3. Initialize `mex` to `n`.

For \( n = 5 \) and \( a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] \):

- For \( i = 4 \): \( p[4] = \text{mex} - a[4] = 5 - 2 = 3 \). Update `mex` to `min(5, 3) = 3`.
- For \( i = 3 \): \( p[3] = \text{mex} - a[3] = 3 - 1 = 2 \). Update `mex` to `min(3, 2) = 2`.
- For \( i = 2 \): \( p[2] = \text{mex} - a[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4 \). Update `mex` to `min(2, 4) = 2`.
- For \( i = 1 \): \( p[1] = \text{mex} - a[1] = 2 - 1 = 1 \). Update `mex` to `min(2, 1) = 1`.
- For \( i = 0 \): \( p[0] = \text{mex} - a[0] = 1 - 1 = 0 \). Update `mex` to `min(1, 0) = 0`.

The resulting permutation \( p \) is `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`. However, this permutation does not satisfy the condition that \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

For \( i = 2 \):
- \( \text{MEX}(0, 1, 4) = 2 \), but \( a_2 = -2 \), which should be \( 2 - 4 = -2 \).

This shows that the program does not correctly generate a permutation that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
