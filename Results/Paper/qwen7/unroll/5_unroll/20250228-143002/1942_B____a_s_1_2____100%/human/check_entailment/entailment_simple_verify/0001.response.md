### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)
```

#### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes an array \( p \) of size \( n \) with all elements set to -1.
   - It initializes \( \text{mex} \) to \( n \).

2. **Backward Construction**:
   - The program iterates backward through the array \( a \) from index \( n-1 \) to 0.
   - For each index \( i \):
     - It sets \( p[i] \) to \( \text{mex} - a[i] \).
     - It updates \( \text{mex} \) to be the minimum of the current \( \text{mex} \) and the newly assigned value \( p[i] \).

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the MEX by simply setting \( \text{mex} \) to the minimum value in the array \( p \). This is not correct because the MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array \( p \) up to that point.
   - For example, if \( p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] \), the MEX would be 5, but the program would incorrectly set \( \text{mex} \) to 2 (the minimum value in \( p \)).

2. **Incorrect Order of Operations**:
   - The program updates \( \text{mex} \) after assigning \( p[i] \), which can lead to incorrect values of \( p \) because \( \text{mex} \) is being updated based on the current state of \( p \), which includes the newly assigned value \( p[i] \).

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to maintain a separate data structure to keep track of the elements that have already appeared in \( p \). Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        used = set()
        
        for i in range(n):
            mex = 0
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            used.add(p[i])
        
        print(*p)
```

#### Correctness:
- The corrected program maintains a set `used` to keep track of the elements that have already been assigned to `p`.
- For each index \( i \), it calculates the MEX correctly by incrementing `mex` until it finds a non-negative integer not in `used`.
- It assigns \( p[i] = \text{mex} - a[i] \) and adds \( p[i] \) to `used`.

Given the issues identified and the need for a correct approach, the original program is indeed incorrect. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final: False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the program.
