The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates a new list `p` of `n` integers based on the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `p` so far. After processing all test cases, it outputs the list `p` for each test case.
