### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the element `x` is at position `l` after performing a binary search. The binary search algorithm should end with `p[l] == x`.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm is correctly defined in the problem statement. It starts with `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`, and it continues until `r - l = 1`. Inside the loop, it calculates the middle index `m` and updates `l` or `r` based on whether `p[m] <= x`.

3. **Swapping Logic**: To ensure `p[l] == x` after the binary search, we need to place `x` at the correct position. We can achieve this by:
   - Finding the index of `x` in the permutation.
   - Placing `x` at position `l` (initially 1) using at most 2 swaps.

4. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The provided code does not contain the actual logic for solving the problem. Instead, it defines several utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) which are typically used for reading input in Python.
   - There is no function that implements the logic to find the correct swaps to make `p[l] == x`.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The annotated code shows that the main logic for finding and swapping elements is missing. Specifically, the code does not include the part where it identifies the correct swaps to place `x` at position `l`.
   - The code only performs the binary search and prints the results without ensuring that `p[l] == x`.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code indicates that the main logic for finding the correct swaps is missing. The code does not include the necessary steps to identify and perform the swaps.
   - The `seen` array is used to keep track of which elements have been visited, but it does not help in identifying the correct swaps.
   - The `temp` list is sorted, but it is not used to find the correct swaps.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incomplete and does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
