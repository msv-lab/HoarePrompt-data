t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, where n is the length of the permutation and x is the number to be found. The second line of each test case contains a list of integers p representing the permutation of length n.
