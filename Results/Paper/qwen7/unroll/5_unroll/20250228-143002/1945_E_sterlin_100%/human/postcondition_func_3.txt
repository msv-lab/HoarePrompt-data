The function processes an external set of inputs (t, n, x, p) where t is an integer between 1 and 20,000, n and x are integers between 1 and 200,000 with 1 ≤ x ≤ n, and p is a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to n. After processing, it returns a string containing two integers separated by a space, followed by another string containing a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to n.
