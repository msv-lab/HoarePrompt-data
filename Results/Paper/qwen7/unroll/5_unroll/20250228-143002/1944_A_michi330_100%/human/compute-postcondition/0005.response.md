Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it checks if \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n - 1 \). If true, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints \( n \). The function outputs \( t \) lines, where \( t \) is the number of test cases, and each line contains either 1 or \( n \) based on the condition.**
