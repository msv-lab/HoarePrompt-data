Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Condition Check**: It checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. 
   - If `k >= n - 1`, it means that Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate Everule from all other islands except possibly island 1. Therefore, the output is `1` because Everule can only visit island 1.
   - If `k < n - 1`, it means that even after destroying `k` bridges, Everule can still find a path to at least one other island. Thus, the output is `n` because Everule can visit all `n` islands.

3. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, ensuring that the output matches the expected format.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
