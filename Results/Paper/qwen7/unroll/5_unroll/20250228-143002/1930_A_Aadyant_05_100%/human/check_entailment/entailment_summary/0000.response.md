Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The program reads `n` as a string and then tries to iterate over a range of `num` which is also a string representation of `n`. This is incorrect because `n` should be an integer, and iterating over a string will cause a TypeError.
2. The program initializes `s` inside the loop for each test case, which means it will reset the score for each test case instead of keeping track of the scores across all test cases.
3. The program reads `a` and `b` as strings and then splits `b` into a list of strings, converting them to integers. However, `a` is not used in the logic, and `b` should be the list of integers for the current test case.
4. The sorting and summing logic is correct, but it should be applied to each test case independently, and the results should be stored and printed separately for each test case.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly process the input and compute the desired output.

Correctness: **False**
