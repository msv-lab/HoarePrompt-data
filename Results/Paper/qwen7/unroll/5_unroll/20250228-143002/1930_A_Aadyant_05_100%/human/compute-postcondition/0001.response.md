Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `final` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `final`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `t` and `n`, while adding the new information that `final` is now an empty list.
