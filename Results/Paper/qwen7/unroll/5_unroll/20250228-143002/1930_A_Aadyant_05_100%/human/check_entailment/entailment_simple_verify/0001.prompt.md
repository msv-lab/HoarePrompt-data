You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

    n = input()

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `n` from the first input line.
   - It then enters a loop where it processes `2n` integers.
   - However, the program incorrectly reads `n` as the number of integers to process instead of `2n`.

2. **List Initialization:**
   - `final` is initialized as an empty list, which will store the scores for each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads a string `a`, which should be ignored.
   - It then reads another string `b`, splits it into a list of strings, and converts them to integers.
   - This part is correct in terms of reading the input integers.

4. **Sorting the List:**
   - The list `list2` is sorted in ascending order.

5. **Calculating the Score:**
   - The program correctly sums up the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of the sorted list, which corresponds to pairing the smallest elements together.
   - This is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.

6. **Storing the Result:**
   - The calculated score `s` is appended to the `final` list.

7. **Outputting Results:**
   - Finally, the program prints each score in the `final` list.

### Issues Identified:
- The main issue is in the line `n = input()`. Here, `n` represents the number of test cases, not the number of integers per test case. The program should read the number of integers (`2n`) directly from the input and process accordingly.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    final = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        list2 = [int(data[index + i]) for i in range(2 * n)]
        index += 2 * n
        
        list2.sort()
        s = sum(list2[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))
        final.append(s)
    
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it misinterprets the value of `n` as the number of integers to process instead of the number of test cases. Therefore, the given program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.

**Correctness: **False**
