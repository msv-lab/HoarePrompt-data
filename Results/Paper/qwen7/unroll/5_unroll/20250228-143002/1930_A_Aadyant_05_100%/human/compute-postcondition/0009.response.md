Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) and 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) within the range of 1 to 10^7. For each test case, it sorts the integers, sums the first number in each pair, and stores these sums in a list. Finally, it prints each sum on a new line.**
