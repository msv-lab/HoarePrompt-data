Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of sticks and their corresponding exponents. It calculates the number of ways to choose three sticks with the same exponent such that their combined length is divisible by 3, and the number of ways to choose two sticks with the same exponent and multiply it by the number of sticks already considered, for each test case. The function then prints these calculated values for each test case.**
