Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of input is a string of n characters where each character is either '.', '@', or '*'. The first character of the string is always '.', indicating that the starting cell is empty. After executing the loop, `ret` is an integer representing the number of times the loop encountered the character '@' before encountering two consecutive '*' characters, and if two consecutive '*' characters were encountered, the loop breaks early.
