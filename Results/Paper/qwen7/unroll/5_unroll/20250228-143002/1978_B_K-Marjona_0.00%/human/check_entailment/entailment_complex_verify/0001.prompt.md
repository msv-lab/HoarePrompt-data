You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of a series of integers printed for each test case. For each test case, if \( b \leq a \), the output is \( a \times n \). Otherwise, the output is \(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k + (n - k) \times a\), where \( k = \min(n, b - a) \).
    #
    #This means for each test case, the program calculates and prints either \( a \times n \) or a more complex expression based on the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \), depending on whether \( b \) is less than or equal to \( a \).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( a \). For each test case, it calculates and prints either \( a \times n \) or a more complex expression based on the values of \( n \) and \( a \), depending on whether \( b \) (which is not explicitly passed but derived from the input) is less than or equal to \( a \). If \( b \leq a \), it prints \( a \times n \); otherwise, it prints \(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k + (n - k) \times a\), where \( k = \min(n, b - a) \). The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an appropriate value of \( k \).
   - The profit calculation depends on whether \( b \) (the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price) is greater than or equal to \( a \) (the usual price of a bun).

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - If \( b \leq a \), the best strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price \( a \). This is because selling any bun at a lower price would result in a loss.
   - If \( b > a \), we need to find the optimal \( k \) to maximize profit. The optimal \( k \) is \( \min(n, b - a) \). This is because selling the first \( k \) buns at prices from \( b \) down to \( b - k + 1 \) and the rest at \( a \) will yield the highest profit.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - For \( k \):
     - The sum of the modified prices for the first \( k \) buns is the sum of an arithmetic series: \( \frac{k(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \).
     - The profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns is \( (n - k) \times a \).

4. **Implementation Verification:**
   - The given code correctly handles both cases:
     - If \( b \leq a \), it prints \( a \times n \).
     - If \( b > a \), it calculates the optimal \( k \) and uses the formula to compute the total profit.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as when \( b \leq a \) and when \( k \) is large (up to \( \min(n, b - a) \)).

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to maximize Bob's profit based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
