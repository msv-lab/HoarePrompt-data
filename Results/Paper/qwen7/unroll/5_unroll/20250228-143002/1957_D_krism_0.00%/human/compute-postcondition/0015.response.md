Output State: `prefix` is a list containing the cumulative XOR of elements from `arr`. The first element is 0, followed by the XOR of each element in `arr` with the previous cumulative XOR result; `pre` remains unchanged as a list of lists containing [32, 0] repeated 32 times; `suf` is a list containing 32 sublists, where each sublist has been updated such that the first element (number of zeros) and the second element (number of ones) reflect the count of bits set to 0 and 1, respectively, across all `cur` values for each bit position from 0 to 31 during the loop executions.
