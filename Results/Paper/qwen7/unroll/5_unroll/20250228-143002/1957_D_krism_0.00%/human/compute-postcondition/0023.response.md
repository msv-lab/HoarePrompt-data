Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of subsequent test cases, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of integers in the list for each test case, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a result based on the provided integers.**

Note: The actual processing logic is not described here as per the instruction.
