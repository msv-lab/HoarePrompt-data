Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing the cumulative XOR of elements from `arr`. The first element is 0, followed by the XOR of each element in `arr` with the previous cumulative XOR result; `pre` is a list of lists containing [0, 0] repeated 32 times; `suf` is a list containing 32 sublists, each with the values [0, 0]**.

Explanation: The code initializes `suf` as a list containing 32 sublists, each with the values [0, 0]. This does not affect the values of `prefix` or `pre`. Therefore, the initial state of `prefix` and `pre` remains unchanged.
