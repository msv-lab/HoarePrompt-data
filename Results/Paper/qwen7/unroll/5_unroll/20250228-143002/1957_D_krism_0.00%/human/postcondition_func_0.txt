The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. It calculates and returns a result based on the cumulative XOR values of the list elements. Specifically, it computes the sum of the products of the number of zeros and ones for each bit position from 0 to 31, derived from the cumulative XOR values of the array elements. The function does not return any value directly but prints the final result.
