#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 2 <= a, b <= 20.
def func_1(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the absolute value of the product of a and b divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd), where 2 <= a, b <= 20.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, both within the range of 2 to 20 inclusive. It calculates and returns the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers where each integer represents the multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning. The length of the list is n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and each element k_i in the list satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20.
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: Output State: `result` is the product of all the integers in the `numbers` list.
    return result
    #The program returns the product of all the integers in the `numbers` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers named `numbers`, where each integer represents a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning. After processing, the function calculates and returns the product of all the integers in the `numbers` list.
