Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` defined in the code do not address the requirements of the problem. Specifically, the problem requires distributing coins in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. The functions provided do not contribute to solving this distribution problem.

To solve the problem, you would need to find a way to distribute the coins such that the sum of the bets is less than the product of the bet and the corresponding multiplier for each outcome. This likely involves finding a common value that satisfies these conditions for all outcomes, which is not what the provided functions are doing.
