Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to the task of distributing coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any winning outcome. 

To solve the problem, we need to distribute the coins in a way that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. However, the given functions do not perform any such distribution. Instead, they seem to be related to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, which is not required for the problem.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
3 2 7
```
The correct output should be a distribution of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. One valid solution could be:
```
27 41 12
```
But the provided program does not generate such a distribution. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
