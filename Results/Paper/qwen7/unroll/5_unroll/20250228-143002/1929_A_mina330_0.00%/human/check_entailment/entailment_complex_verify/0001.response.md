### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array \( a \).
   - It calculates the beauty of the array by summing up the differences between the largest and smallest elements in pairs.

3. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the largest elements are paired with the smallest elements, maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative ones.
   - However, the current implementation only considers pairs of the form \( (a_{n-i}, a_i) \) for \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, \frac{n}{2} \). This approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty for all possible permutations of the array.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array has an even number of elements, the solution correctly pairs them.
   - If the array has an odd number of elements, the middle element is not paired, which might not yield the maximum possible beauty. For example, consider the array \([1, 2, 3]\). Sorting it gives \([1, 2, 3]\), and the current solution would calculate \( (3 - 1) = 2 \). However, the optimal solution would be to rearrange the array to \([2, 1, 3]\), yielding \( (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 \), which is the same in this case but may differ in other scenarios.

5. **Verification**:
   - The example cases provided in the problem statement confirm the correctness of the solution for specific examples, but they do not cover all possible edge cases. For instance, the example \([1, 2, 3]\) is correctly handled, but more complex arrays might not be.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not always correctly maximize the beauty of the array. While sorting the array and pairing the largest and smallest elements in pairs is a good heuristic, it does not guarantee the maximum beauty for all possible permutations of the array. A more general approach, such as considering all possible permutations and calculating the beauty for each permutation, would be required to ensure the maximum beauty is achieved.

**Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
