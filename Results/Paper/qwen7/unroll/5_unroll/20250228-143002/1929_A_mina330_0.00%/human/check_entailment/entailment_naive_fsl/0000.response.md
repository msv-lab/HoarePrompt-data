Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and then pairing the smallest and largest elements to calculate the difference. However, this approach does not always yield the maximum possible beauty. For example, consider the input:

```
5
10 20 30 40 50
```

The program would sort the array to `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` and then calculate the beauty as `(10-20) + (30-40) = -10 + -10 = -20`. However, the optimal arrangement to maximize the beauty would be `[50, 10, 40, 20, 30]`, which gives a beauty of `(50-10) + (40-20) + (30-30) = 40 + 20 + 0 = 60`.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence is incorrect.
