The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads a positive integer t (though t is not used in the function), an integer n, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. It sorts the list of integers, then calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, for each pair of elements in the list. Finally, it prints the calculated sum for each test case.
