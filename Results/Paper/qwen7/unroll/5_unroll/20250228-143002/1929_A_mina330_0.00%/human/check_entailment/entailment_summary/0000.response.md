Reasoning:
The given program aims to maximize the beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. 

The program works as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
3. It sorts the array.
4. It calculates the sum of the differences between pairs of elements, specifically the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.

This approach is correct because:
- Sorting the array ensures that the largest and smallest elements are paired together, which maximizes their difference.
- By pairing the largest with the smallest, the second largest with the second smallest, etc., we ensure that the sum of these differences is maximized.

Given this logic, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
