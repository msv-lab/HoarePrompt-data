Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). Following n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are also provided for each test case. The function returns results based on the processing of these inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for t and n, followed by n integers. The function processes these inputs but does not explicitly take any parameters in its definition; instead, it likely reads from an external source like standard input or a file.
