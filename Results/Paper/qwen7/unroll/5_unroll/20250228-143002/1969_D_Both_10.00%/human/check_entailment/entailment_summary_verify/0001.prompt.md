You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Example

Input

    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    4 1
    
    1 2 1 4
    
    3 3 2 3
    
    4 2
    
    2 1 1 1
    
    4 2 3 2
    
    6 2
    
    1 3 4 9 1 3
    
    7 6 8 10 6 8

Output

    1
    1
    0
    7
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

- Program:
import heapq
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    return int(putin())

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return map(int, putin().split())

#Function 3:
def func_3(main_ar, sec_arr):
    sub_summ = 0
    for val_a in sec_arr:
        sub_summ += val_a[0]
    for val_b in main_ar:
        if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
            sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
    return sub_summ



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function accepts two parameters: `main_ar`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, and `sec_arr`, a list of integers, both of the same length. It calculates the sum of the first and second elements of each tuple in `main_ar` where their sum is greater than or equal to 0, and returns this sum.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: This function is supposed to read an integer from input.
   - `func_2()`: This function is supposed to read multiple integers separated by spaces and return them as a tuple.
   - `func_3(main_ar, sec_arr)`: This function is supposed to compute a sum based on the elements of `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.

2. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to calculate Alice's profit considering the optimal strategies of both Alice and Bob.
   - Alice wants to maximize her profit, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The profit calculation involves comparing the prices `a_i` and `b_i` for each item.

3. **Key Points**:
   - Alice should buy items such that the difference `b_i - a_i` is maximized.
   - Bob will take either all items or the k most expensive ones for free, depending on the number of items Alice buys.
   - The goal is to find the best strategy for Alice to maximize her profit under these conditions.

4. **Code Review**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not used in the main logic, which is a good sign as they are not needed.
   - The function `func_3(main_ar, sec_arr)` seems to be intended to calculate a sum but does not align with the problem requirements.

5. **Algorithm**:
   - To solve this problem, we need to:
     - Sort items based on the difference `b_i - a_i`.
     - Calculate the total cost for Alice if she buys all items.
     - Determine the optimal strategy for Bob and adjust the total cost accordingly.

### Correct Implementation:

```python
import heapq

def solve(n, k, a, b):
    # Calculate the differences and sort items
    diff = sorted([(b[i] - a[i], i) for i in range(n)], reverse=True)
    
    # Calculate the total cost if Alice buys all items
    total_cost = sum(b)
    alice_profit = total_cost
    
    # If Alice buys more than k items, Bob will take k items for free
    if n > k:
        # Calculate the cost of the k most expensive items for Alice
        for _, idx in diff[:k]:
            alice_profit -= b[idx]
    
    return alice_profit

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(solve(n, k, a, b))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution. It lacks the necessary logic to handle the optimal strategies of both Alice and Bob. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
