### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can make all elements of the array `a` zero by repeatedly applying the specified operation.
   - The operation involves choosing an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`) and decrementing `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by specific amounts (`-1`, `-2`, and `-1` respectively).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - **Function `func_1`:** This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero, otherwise `False`.
   - **Function `func_2`:** This function attempts to make all elements zero by repeatedly applying the specified operation. If at any point the operation cannot be applied (i.e., there's no valid `i` where the conditions are met), it prints 'NO' and returns. If all elements eventually become zero, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Checking Function `func_2`:**
   - The loop in `func_2` iterates through indices `i` from `1` to `n-2` (inclusive).
   - Inside the loop, it uses a `while` loop to apply the operation as long as the conditions allow (i.e., `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`).
   - After applying the operation, it checks if `list[i-1]` is still non-zero. If so, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the operation and checks if it can make all elements zero.
   - The `while` loop ensures that the operation is applied as long as possible for each valid index `i`.
   - The final check with `func_1` ensures that the array is indeed all zeros before printing 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operation. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
