Output State: The list `list` will be modified according to the operations inside the loop. For each element `i` in the range (1, n-1), if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`, the following operations will be performed: `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`, `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`, and `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`. If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero, the loop will terminate early and print 'no' before completing all iterations.

If the loop completes without being terminated early, the final state of the list will be the result of applying the above operations to each eligible element. If the loop is terminated early due to `list[i-1]` becoming zero, the output will be 'no'.
