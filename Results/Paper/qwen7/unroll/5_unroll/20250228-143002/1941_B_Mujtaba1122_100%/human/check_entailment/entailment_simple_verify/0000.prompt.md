You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers representing the array elements, and n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array.
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: Output State: The list remains unchanged, and the value of n remains unchanged. If any element in the list is not 0, the loop will return False; otherwise, it will return True after completing all iterations.
    return True
    #The program returns True if all elements in the list are 0, otherwise it returns False.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `list` is a list of integers representing the array `a`, and `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Each element in the list is an integer in the range [0, 10^9].
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
        
    #State: Output State: The list `list` undergoes modifications based on the conditions within the loop. For each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`, then `list[i+1]` is decreased by `list[i-1]`, `list[i]` is decreased by `2 * list[i-1]`, and `list[i-1]` is decreased by `list[i-1]`. If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero, the program prints 'no' and returns immediately. After all iterations, if no early termination occurs, the final state of the list `list` is the result of these operations.
    #
    #If the loop completes without printing 'no', the output state will be a modified version of the initial list where each element has been adjusted according to the specified rules.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The list `list` undergoes modifications based on the conditions within the loop. For each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`, then `list[i+1]` is decreased by `list[i-1]`, `list[i]` is decreased by `2 * list[i-1]`, and `list[i-1]` is decreased by `list[i-1]`. If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero, the program prints 'no' and returns immediately. After all iterations, if no early termination occurs, the final state of the list `list` is the result of these operations. Regardless of whether `func_1(list, n)` evaluates to True or False, the final state of the list remains consistent with the described operations.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not properly handle the reduction of elements according to the given operation rules. 

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
3
5
1 3 5 5 2
5
2 4 4 5 1
5
0 1 3 3 1
```

The expected output is:
```
YES
NO
YES
```

However, the current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly reduce the elements according to the operation rules. For instance, in the third test case `[0, 1, 3, 3, 1]`, the program should be able to reduce the array to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` but it incorrectly prints "NO" because it does not properly handle the reduction process. 

A correct implementation would involve ensuring that the operations are applied in a way that guarantees all elements can be reduced to zero if possible. The current implementation fails to do so, hence the output is incorrect for certain inputs.
