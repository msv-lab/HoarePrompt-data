Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not properly handle the reduction of elements according to the given operation rules. 

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
3
5
1 3 5 5 2
5
2 4 4 5 1
5
0 1 3 3 1
```

The expected output is:
```
YES
NO
YES
```

However, the current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly reduce the elements according to the operation rules. For instance, in the third test case `[0, 1, 3, 3, 1]`, the program should be able to reduce the array to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` but it incorrectly prints "NO" because it does not properly handle the reduction process. 

A correct implementation would involve ensuring that the operations are applied in a way that guarantees all elements can be reduced to zero if possible. The current implementation fails to do so, hence the output is incorrect for certain inputs.
