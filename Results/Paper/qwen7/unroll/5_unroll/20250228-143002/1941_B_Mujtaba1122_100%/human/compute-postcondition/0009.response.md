Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers and an integer n. It iterates through the list, modifying its elements based on specific conditions. If any condition is violated during the iteration, it prints 'no' and returns immediately. If the iteration completes without violating any conditions, it calls another function `func_1(list, n)`. Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. Regardless of the outcome, the final state of the list reflects the modifications performed during the iteration.**
