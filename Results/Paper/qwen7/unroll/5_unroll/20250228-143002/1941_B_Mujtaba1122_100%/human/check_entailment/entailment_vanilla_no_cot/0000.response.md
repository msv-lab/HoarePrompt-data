Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Operation Implementation**: The operation defined in the problem description is not correctly implemented in `func_2`. Specifically, the way the operation is applied within the loop is flawed. The operation should reduce three consecutive elements based on the value of the middle element, but the current implementation does not correctly handle this logic.

2. **Early Termination**: The function `func_2` prints 'no' and returns immediately if it finds a non-zero element at any point during the operation, which is not the correct approach. It should continue processing the array until it either makes all elements zero or determines that it's impossible.

3. **Final Check**: The final check with `func_1` is unnecessary and incorrectly placed. The function `func_1` should be called after the operations have been fully applied to the array, not before.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def can_make_zero(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while arr[i] > 1 and arr[i - 1] > 0 and arr[i + 1] > 0:
            arr[i + 1] -= 1
            arr[i] -= 2
            arr[i - 1] -= 1
    # After applying all possible operations, check if all elements are zero
    return func_1(arr, n)

def func_1(arr, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        arr = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        if can_make_zero(arr):
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")
```

This corrected version ensures that the operations are applied correctly and checks the final state of the array to determine if all elements can be made zero.
