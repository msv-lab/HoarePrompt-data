### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can make all elements of the array `a` zero by repeatedly applying the specified operation.
   - The operation involves choosing an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`) and decrementing `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by specific amounts (`-1`, `-2`, and `-1` respectively).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - **Function `func_1`:** This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero, otherwise `False`.
   - **Function `func_2`:** This function attempts to make all elements zero by repeatedly applying the specified operation. If at any point the operation cannot be applied (i.e., there's no valid `i` where the conditions are met), it prints 'NO' and returns. If all elements eventually become zero, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Checking Function `func_2`:**
   - The loop in `func_2` iterates through indices `i` from `1` to `n-2` (inclusive).
   - Inside the loop, it uses a `while` loop to apply the operation as long as the conditions allow (i.e., `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`).
   - After applying the operation, it checks if `list[i-1]` is still non-zero. If so, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the operation and checks if it can make all elements zero.
   - The `while` loop ensures that the operation is applied as long as possible for each valid index `i`.
   - The final check with `func_1` ensures that the array is indeed all zeros before printing 'YES'.
   - However, the provided code has a critical flaw: it does not handle the case where the array can never be reduced to all zeros due to the nature of the operation. Specifically, if the sum of the elements in the array is odd, it is impossible to reduce all elements to zero because each operation reduces the sum by an even number (2 from `a_i` and 1 from each of `a_{i-1}` and `a_{i+1}`).

5. **Annotated Code Validation:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic flow.
   - However, the annotated code does not account for the possibility that the sum of the array elements being odd can prevent the array from being reduced to all zeros.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the sum of the array elements is odd, which makes it impossible to reduce all elements to zero. Therefore, the program should check the sum of the array elements before proceeding with the operations.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
