You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 500
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())

        a = [0] * n
        
        a[0] = 500
        
        for i in range(1, n):

        print(*a)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n. After executing the loop, a is a list of n integers where a[0] = 500 and a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1] for all 1 ≤ i < n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n`, followed by a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It then constructs a list `a` of length `n` starting with `a[0] = 500` and each subsequent element `a[i]` is calculated as `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. Finally, it prints the list `a` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all potential cases. Specifically, the program initializes `a[0]` to 500 and then sets each subsequent element `a[i]` to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. However, this approach does not guarantee that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
2 4 1
```
The program generates the array `a` as follows:
- `a[0] = 500`
- `a[1] = 500 + 2 = 502`
- `a[2] = 502 + 4 = 506`
- `a[3] = 506 + 1 = 507`

However, `x_2 = 4`, but `506 \bmod 502 = 4`, which is correct. But `x_3 = 1`, and `507 \bmod 506 = 1`, which is also correct. Therefore, this specific example works, but the general approach does not guarantee correctness for all cases.

A correct solution would need to ensure that each `a_i` is chosen such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true. The provided solution does not account for this requirement in a general way.
