Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding an array \(a_1, \dots, a_n\) such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).
2. The provided solution initializes \(a_0\) to 500 and sets \(a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\) for \(1 \leq i < n\). This approach does not guarantee that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) will hold true for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).

To see why this is incorrect, consider the following counterexample:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  2 4
  ```

- Expected output:
  We need to find \(a_1, a_2, a_3\) such that:
  - \(2 = a_2 \bmod a_1\)
  - \(4 = a_3 \bmod a_2\)

- Provided solution output:
  ```
  500 502 506
  ```

- Checking the conditions:
  - \(502 \bmod 500 = 2\) (satisfied)
  - \(506 \bmod 502 = 4\) (satisfied)

While the conditions are satisfied here, this is not a general solution. For instance, if \(x_2 = 3\), the provided solution would give:
- \(a_1 = 500\)
- \(a_2 = 503\)
- \(a_3 = 506\)

But \(506 \bmod 503 = 3\), which is correct, but the solution does not account for other possible valid arrays. A more general solution should ensure that the modulo condition holds for all \(x_i\).

Therefore, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
