Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state of `t` was specified as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\), the new value of `t` will still satisfy this condition. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
