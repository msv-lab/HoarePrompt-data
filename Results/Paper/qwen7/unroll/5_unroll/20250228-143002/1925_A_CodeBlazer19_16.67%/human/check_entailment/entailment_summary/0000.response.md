Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input format and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, the program constructs a string `s` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
3. If `k` is 1, the program prints the single character repeated `n` times, which ensures all possible strings of length `n` (which are just the character itself) are subsequences.
4. If `k` is greater than 1, the program prints the constructed string repeated `(2 - (n == 1))` times. This ensures that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of the output string.
5. The logic for constructing the string `s` and repeating it is correct based on the problem requirements.
6. The program handles all given constraints and examples correctly.

Given the above points, the program appears to meet the problem's requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
