Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
3. It constructs a string `s` containing characters from 'a' to the character with ASCII value `k + 96`.
4. If `k` is 1, it prints the string `s` repeated `n` times.
5. If `k` is greater than 1, it prints the string `s` repeated `(2 - (n == 1))` times.
6. This ensures that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
7. The logic handles the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement accurately.

Given the analysis, the program appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
