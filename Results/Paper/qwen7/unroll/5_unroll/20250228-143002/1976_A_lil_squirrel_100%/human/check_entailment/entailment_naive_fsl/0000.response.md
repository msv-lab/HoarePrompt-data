Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly verifies whether a password meets the specified conditions for being strong. It checks the following:

1. **Letters and Digits**: The program separates letters and digits into two lists.
2. **Sorted Order**: It checks if both the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. **No Digit After Letter**: It ensures that there is no digit immediately following a letter.

The program handles all the given test cases correctly:
- For "12ac", it returns "YES" because letters are sorted and there are no digits after letters.
- For "123wa", it returns "NO" because the letters are not sorted.
- For "allllmost", it returns "YES" because letters are sorted and there are no digits after letters.
- For "ac123", it returns "NO" because there is a digit after a letter.
- For "011679", it returns "YES" because digits are sorted and there are no letters after digits.

Since the program correctly handles all the conditions and test cases provided, it is correct.
