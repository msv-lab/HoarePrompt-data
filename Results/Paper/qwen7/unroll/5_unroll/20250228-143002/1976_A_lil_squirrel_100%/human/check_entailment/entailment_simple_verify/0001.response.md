### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Separating Characters:**
   - The program correctly separates the characters into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.

3. **Sorting Checks:**
   - The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - The program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Digit After Letter Check:**
   - The program iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. If this condition is violated, it returns 'NO'.

5. **Final Return:**
   - If all conditions are satisfied, it returns 'YES'.

### Evaluation Based on Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - Before the function call, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), and `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.

- **Function Execution:**
  - The function separates the characters into `letters` and `digits`.
  - It checks if `letters` and `digits` are sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - It ensures that no digit comes after a letter.

- **Annotations:**
  - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points, validating the steps taken by the program.
  - The function correctly handles the sorting and digit-after-letter checks as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the conditions specified for a strong password according to the problem description.

### Final:
**True**
