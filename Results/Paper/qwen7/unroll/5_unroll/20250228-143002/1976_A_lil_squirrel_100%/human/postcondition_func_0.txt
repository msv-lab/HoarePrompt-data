The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), and `password`, a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It separates the characters in `password` into two lists: one for letters and one for digits. The function then checks if both lists are sorted and ensures there are no instances where a letter is immediately followed by a digit. If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.
