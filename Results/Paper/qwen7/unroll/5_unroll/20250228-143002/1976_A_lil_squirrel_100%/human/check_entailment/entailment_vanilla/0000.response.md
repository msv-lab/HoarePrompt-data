Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
3. It separates the characters into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
4. It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
5. It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
6. It iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. If this condition is violated, it returns 'NO'.
7. If all conditions are satisfied, it returns 'YES'.

Given the problem description and the implementation, the program appears to correctly implement the conditions specified for a strong password.

Correctness: **True**
