You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` is an input string, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `out` is a list containing the sum of every second element from a sorted list of `a` space-separated integers, repeated `int(num)` times.
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)
        
    #State: Output State: `out` is a list containing the sum of every second element from a sorted list of `a` space-separated integers, printed `int(num)` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer t and 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}. For each test case, it sorts the 2n integers, selects every second element from the sorted list, sums these elements, and repeats this process t times. Finally, it prints the sum of every second element for each test case, repeated t times.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. The program should take multiple test cases, each with `2n` integers, and output the maximum score achievable.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `num`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `a` (which is actually `2n`), and then reads a string of space-separated integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes an empty list `list2`.
   - It splits the input string into a list of integers `list1`.
   - It sorts `list1`.
   - It creates a new list `list2` containing every other element from the sorted `list1` starting from index 0.
   - It calculates the sum of elements in `list2` and appends this sum to the output list `out`.

3. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints each element of `out`.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Input Reading:**
   - The program reads `num` as the number of test cases but then uses `range(int(num))` to iterate over the number of test cases. This is incorrect because `num` is the number of test cases, not the number of elements in each test case.
   - The program should use `for _ in range(int(num)):` to correctly iterate over the test cases.

2. **Incorrect List Initialization:**
   - The program clears `list1` and `list2` using `del list1[:]` and `del list2[:]`. However, these lists are reinitialized within the loop, so clearing them is unnecessary and redundant.

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program sums every other element starting from index 0. This is incorrect because it does not consider all possible pairs and always takes the smaller element from the sorted list. The correct approach is to sum the smallest `n` elements directly.

4. **Sorting and Pairs Selection:**
   - Sorting the list and then taking every other element starting from index 0 is not optimal. Instead, the program should simply sum the smallest `n` elements, which can be achieved without sorting.

### Corrected Program
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    num = int(input())
    out = []
    for _ in range(num):
        n = int(input())
        numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        out.append(sum(sorted(numbers)[:n]))
    for score in out:
        print(score)

func()
```

### Conclusion
The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. The corrected program ensures that the maximum score is calculated correctly by summing the smallest `n` elements from the sorted list.

**Correctness:** **False**
