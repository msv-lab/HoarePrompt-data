Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for numbers in range(int(num))`. The variables involved here are `numbers` and `int(num)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `numbers` is a variable used within the loop to iterate over the range defined by `int(num)`.
   - `int(num)` is the upper limit of the range.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `numbers` is less than `int(num)`. Therefore, the loop will start with `numbers = 0` and increment until `numbers` reaches `int(num) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the initial state**:
   - `numbers` should be initialized to 0 because it is the starting point of the loop.
   - `int(num)` should be set to the value of `num` converted to an integer, ensuring the loop runs the correct number of times.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000 (not relevant to the loop).
- `num` is an input string.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 (not relevant to the loop).
- `out` is an empty list (not relevant to the loop).

We need to adjust the states of `numbers` and `int(num)`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `numbers` should be 0.
- `int(num)` should be the integer value of `num`.

**Final State:**
State: **`numbers` is 0, `int(num)` is the integer value of `num`**
