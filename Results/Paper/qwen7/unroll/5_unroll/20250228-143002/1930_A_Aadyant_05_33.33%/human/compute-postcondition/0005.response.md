Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable in the given for loop is `outputs`.
   - The object being iterated over is `out`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Loop:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
   - `num` is an input string.
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
   - `out` is a list containing the sum of every second element from a sorted list of `a` space-separated integers, repeated `int(num)` times.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `out`.
   - For the loop to execute, `out` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop iterates over `out`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is related to `out`.
   - `out` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `out` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` is an input string, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `out` is a list that must contain at least one element**
