You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is an empty string, `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `d` is a dictionary where each key from 0 to n (inclusive) represents the balance of parentheses up to that index in `s`. The value at each key is the difference between the number of '(' and ')' characters from the start of the string up to that index.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is a string consisting of all '(' characters from the string `s`, sorted based on the balance of parentheses up to each index in descending order.
    return ans
    #The program returns a string consisting of all '(' characters from the string 's', sorted based on the balance of parentheses up to each index in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")" forming a balanced parentheses sequence. It calculates the balance of parentheses up to each index, sorts these balances in descending order, and collects all "(" characters from `s` based on this sorted order. Finally, it returns a string containing these collected "(" characters.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Function Call**:
   - The program reads an input string `s` which is a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - It calls a function `func_1(s)` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes a string `s` as input.
   - It initializes an empty string `ans` to store the final result.
   - It uses a dictionary `d` to keep track of the balance at each position.
     - `d[0] = 0` initializes the balance at the start.
     - For each character in the string, it updates the balance:
       - If the character is '(', the balance increases by 1.
       - If the character is ')', the balance decreases by 1.
     - After processing all characters, it removes the entry for the last position `n` from the dictionary.
   - It sorts the dictionary items based on the balance values (in ascending order) and positions (in descending order).
   - Finally, it constructs the result string `ans` by concatenating the characters at the sorted positions.

### Checking the Correctness

1. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The balance calculation is correctly implemented. The dictionary `d` keeps track of the balance at each position, which is essential for the next steps.

2. **Sorting Logic**:
   - The sorting logic is almost correct but needs a small adjustment. The current implementation sorts the dictionary items using `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))`. However, the keys should be sorted in increasing order of balance and then in decreasing order of position. The current implementation sorts in the opposite order for the position part (`-x[0]`).

3. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The construction of the result string `ans` by iterating over the sorted dictionary is correct. It appends the characters at the sorted positions to `ans`.

### Corrected Sorting Logic

To fix the sorting issue, the lambda function in the `sorted` call should be adjusted to sort by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {0: 0}
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]), reverse=True)
    for (i, _) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans
```

### Final Conclusion

After reviewing the code and making the necessary adjustments, the original program is almost correct but requires a minor change in the sorting logic. Therefore, the original program is **not fully correct** due to the sorting issue.

### Correctness: **False**
