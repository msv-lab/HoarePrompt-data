Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, the length `n` will be a positive integer within the range of 1 to 500,000. The content of `s` remains unchanged.
