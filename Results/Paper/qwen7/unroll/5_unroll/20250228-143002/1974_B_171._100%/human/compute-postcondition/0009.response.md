Functionality: **The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a new string `decoded`. This `decoded` string is generated by mapping each character in `encoded` to its corresponding character based on a dictionary `char_map`, where the keys and values of `char_map` are reversed compared to their original positions in the sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`.**
