Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and then splits the data into individual components. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it extracts the necessary information (length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself) and calls the `func_1` function to decode the string.

3. **Decoding Logic in `func_1`**:
   - It first finds all unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - It creates a mapping where each character in the sorted list is paired with its corresponding symmetric character (i.e., the character at the opposite end of the sorted list).
   - It then uses this mapping to decode the entire encoded string by replacing each character according to the mapping.

4. **Output**: The decoded strings are collected in a list and printed out one by one.

Given that the logic accurately reflects the problem description and handles the input and output as specified, the program is correct.
