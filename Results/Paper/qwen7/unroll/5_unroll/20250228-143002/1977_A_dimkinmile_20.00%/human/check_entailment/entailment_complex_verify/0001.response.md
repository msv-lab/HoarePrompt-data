### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the program. The function `func_1()` is defined but never called within the loop. As a result, the program raises a `NameError` when it tries to execute the loop. The annotated code and the original assessment highlight this flaw accurately.

To verify this, let's break down the program execution:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The variable `kreker` is correctly initialized to read the number of test cases.
   - A loop runs for `kreker` times, which is appropriate for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is indeed incorrect because the function should be called within the loop to process each test case.

3. **Test Case Processing**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, the function correctly reads two integers `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. If true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program logic is almost correct, but the function `func_1()` is not called within the loop, leading to a `NameError`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identified the issue and provided a clear explanation. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect due to the missing function call within the loop.

**Final: False**

The program needs to be corrected by calling `func_1()` within the loop, as shown in the corrected version provided in the reasoning section.
