Let's analyze the provided program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The variable `kreker` is correctly initialized to read the number of test cases.
   - A loop runs for `kreker` times, which is appropriate for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is incorrect because the function should be called within the loop to process each test case.

3. **Test Case Processing**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, the function correctly reads two integers `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. If true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Given these points, the program logic is almost correct, but there is an issue with the function call within the loop. The function `func_1()` is defined but never called in the main loop. Instead, the loop directly calls the undefined `func_1()` function, which leads to a NameError.

To fix this, we need to call `func_1()` inside the loop.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

Should be:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

Since the original program does not correctly call the function `func_1()` within the loop, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
