Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `input()`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main part of the program. This is an error because the function should be called within the loop to process each test case.

3. **Test Case Processing**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program correctly reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case.
   - It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. If true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Logical Error**:
   - The issue lies in the fact that the function `func_1()` is never actually called in the main loop. Instead, there is a call to `func_1()` outside the loop, which is incorrect.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as intended. The function `func_1()` needs to be called within the loop to handle each test case properly.

### Corrected Program:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Correctness:
- **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not call the `func_1()` function within the loop to process each test case.
