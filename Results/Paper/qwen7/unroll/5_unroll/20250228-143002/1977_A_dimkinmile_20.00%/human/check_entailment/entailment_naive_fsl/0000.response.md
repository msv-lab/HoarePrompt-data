Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the logic for determining whether it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, the program only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is not sufficient. 

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `m = 4`. According to the problem description, Nikita can either add or remove one cube per move. Therefore, it is impossible to end up with 4 cubes after only 2 moves because he can only add or remove one cube at a time. However, the current implementation would incorrectly output "Yes" for this case since `2 >= 4` is false but the logic does not account for the alternating nature of adding and removing cubes.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the difference between `n` and `m` is even, as each pair of moves (add and remove) results in no net change in the number of cubes.
