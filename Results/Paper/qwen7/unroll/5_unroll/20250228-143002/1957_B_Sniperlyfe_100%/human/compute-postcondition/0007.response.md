Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` of length `n` where `nums[0]` is (1 << (`k`'s bit length - 1)) - 1 + `k`. For all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `nums[i]` is equal to `k` if `k > 0` and 1 otherwise, with `k` being 0 after the loop finishes.**

To break it down:
1. The initial state defines that `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` and `k` are integers with constraints on their values, and `nums` is a list of length `n`.
2. The first element of the list `nums` is calculated as \((1 << (\text{bit length of } k - 1)) - 1 + k\).
3. For all subsequent elements in the list (from index 1 to `n-1`), the value is `k` if `k` is greater than 0, otherwise, it is 1.
4. After the loop, `k` becomes 0.

Therefore, the final list `nums` will have its first element as \((1 << (\text{bit length of } k - 1)) - 1 + k\) and the rest of the elements will be `k` if `k` is greater than 0, otherwise 1, with `k` being 0 after the loop.
