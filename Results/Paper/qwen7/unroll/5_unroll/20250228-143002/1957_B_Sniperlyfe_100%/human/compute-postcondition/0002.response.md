Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` zeros; `nums[0]` is (1 << (`k`'s bit length - 1)) - 1; `k` is reduced by `(1 << (`k`'s bit length - 1)) - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `k -= nums[0]` subtracts the value of `nums[0]` from `k`. Given that `nums[0]` is set to `(1 << (`k`'s bit length - 1)) - 1`, the value of `k` is reduced by this amount. All other variables remain unchanged.
