Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input to initialize the field, players, and goals.
2. **Movement Function**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the new position of a player based on the direction of movement.
3. **Action Handling**: The program handles different actions correctly:
   - **Movement**: Players can move up, down, left, or right.
   - **Catching**: A player can catch the Quaffle if they are in the same position.
   - **Throwing**: A player can throw the Quaffle if they are carrying it.
4. **Scoring Logic**: The program correctly updates the score when a player scores in the opponent's goal and prints the corresponding message.
5. **Final Score Output**: The program outputs the final score at the end of the game.

Given the annotated program and the reasoning above, the program appears to be handling all aspects of the problem correctly.

Correctness: **True**
