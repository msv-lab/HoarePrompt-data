Reasoning:
1. **Field Initialization and Player/Goal Tracking**: The program correctly initializes the field dimensions and tracks the positions of players and goals. The `players` dictionary and `goals` dictionary are used appropriately to store the positions of players and goals for both teams.

2. **Movement Function**: The `func_1` function is correctly defined to update the position of a player based on the movement direction. This function correctly handles the movement within the field boundaries, ensuring that players do not move outside the field.

3. **Game Logic**: The program correctly processes each step of the game:
   - It updates the position of the player based on the movement command.
   - It checks if the player has scored a goal by checking if the player's position matches a goal of the opposing team.
   - It updates the score and prints the appropriate message when a goal is scored.
   - It ensures that the Quaffle is reset to the center of the field after a goal is scored.

4. **Final Score Calculation**: After processing all steps, the program correctly prints the final score.

Given the provided annotated program and the reasoning above, the program appears to follow the problem specification accurately and handle all necessary aspects of the game logic.

Correctness: **True**
