Reasoning:
1. The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:
   - The function `func_1` is not used correctly. The function should take a tuple representing a player's position and a direction, and return the new position after moving.
   - The variable names and logic in the main part of the program do not align with the expected behavior. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not called with the correct arguments.
   - The logic for handling the catching and throwing of the Quaffle is missing.
   - The scoring mechanism is incomplete and does not handle the correct scoring conditions.

2. Based on the provided execution summary, the function `func_1` is intended to update the position of a player given a direction. However, the function is not being used correctly in the main part of the program.

3. The main part of the program needs to handle the movement, catching, and throwing of the Quaffle, and update the scores accordingly. The current implementation does not handle these actions properly.

Given these observations, the provided program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
