Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}; A and B are calculated as A=int(m/a)+1 and B=int(m/b)+1 respectively, and the sum A+B is printed for each test case.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It then calculates two values `A` and `B` using the formulas `A=int(m/a)+1` and `B=int(m/b)+1`, respectively. After calculating these values, it prints the sum `A+B`. However, since the actual values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not provided, the specific values of `A` and `B` cannot be determined. The only thing that changes from the initial state is the calculation and printing of `A+B` for each test case.
