Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `qi` and `t`.
2. **Determine the Initial State of `qi`**: The variable `qi` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to t-1.
3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `qi < t`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.
4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can start and execute properly. This means `t` must be greater than 0, and `qi` should be initialized to 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `input` is taken for each test case.
- `A` and `B` are yet to be calculated based on the given formula.
- Their sum is yet to be printed for each test case.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can start and execute correctly. Specifically, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 and `qi` is initialized to 0.

**State:**
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `qi` is 0
- `input` is yet to be taken
- `A` and `B` are yet to be calculated based on the given formula
- Their sum is yet to be printed for each test case

However, since we are focusing on the loop head variables, the relevant adjustments are:

**State:**
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `qi` is 0

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `qi` is 0**
