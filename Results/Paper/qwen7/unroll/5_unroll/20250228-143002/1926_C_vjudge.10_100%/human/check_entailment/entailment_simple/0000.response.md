### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The function initializes `inf` to `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1` which ensures that the array `values` can hold up to `200001` elements.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the value of `n`.

2. **Digit Sum Calculation**:
   - For each number `i` from `1` to `inf`, it calculates the sum of the digits of `i` and updates the `values` array to store the cumulative sum of these digit sums up to `i`.
   - This step ensures that `values[i]` contains the sum of the digit sums from `1` to `i`.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and prints `values[n]`, which gives the sum of the digit sums from `1` to `n`.

4. **Efficiency Consideration**:
   - The precomputation step runs in `O(inf)` time, which is `O(200001)`. This is efficient enough given the constraints (`1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5`).
   - Each query is answered in constant time `O(1)` using the precomputed values.

Given that the logic correctly precomputes the cumulative sums of digit sums and uses these precomputed values to answer each query efficiently, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
