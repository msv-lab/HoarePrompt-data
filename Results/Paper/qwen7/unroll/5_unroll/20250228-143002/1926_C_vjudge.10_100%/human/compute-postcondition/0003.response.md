Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `inf`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `inf`. Since `inf` is a constant value (200001), the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 200001.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that the initial state of `i` is 1 and that `i` remains less than 200001 for the loop to execute properly.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000.
- `inf` is 200001.
- `values` is a list of 200001 zeros.

We need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure the loop starts correctly and continues to execute.

**Final State**:
- `i` is 1.
- `inf` is 200001.

Since the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `values`) are not directly involved in the loop condition, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

**State:**
**`i` is 1, `inf` is 200001**
