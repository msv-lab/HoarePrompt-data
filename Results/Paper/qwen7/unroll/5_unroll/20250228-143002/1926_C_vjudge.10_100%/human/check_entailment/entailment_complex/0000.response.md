Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization and Setup**:
   - The function initializes an array `values` of size `inf` (which is set to 200001) to store the cumulative sums of the digit sums from 1 to `i`.
   - It iterates through each number from 1 to 200000, calculating the sum of the digits of each number and updating the cumulative sum in the `values` array.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - For each number `i`, the sum of its digits is calculated and added to the cumulative sum stored at `values[i]`.
   - This ensures that `values[i]` contains the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`.

3. **Test Case Processing**:
   - The function then processes `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the cumulative sum stored at `values[n]`.
   - Since `values[n]` already contains the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n`, this step correctly outputs the required result for each test case.

4. **Time Complexity**:
   - The initial setup to calculate the cumulative sums takes O(n) time, where n is 200000.
   - Each test case query is answered in O(1) time since it simply involves a lookup in the precomputed `values` array.
   - Given the constraints (t ≤ 10^4 and n ≤ 2 * 10^5), the solution is efficient and meets the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case.

Given the above points, the program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
