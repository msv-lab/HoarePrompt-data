Reasoning:
1. The program aims to calculate the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `n` and then sum these results.
2. To optimize this, the program precomputes the cumulative sum of digit sums for all numbers up to 200,000 and stores them in the `values` list.
3. For each test case, it uses the precomputed values to quickly find the required sum without recalculating the digit sums for each number individually.
4. The input handling and output printing are correctly implemented, reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case by reading `n` and printing the corresponding cumulative sum from the `values` list.
5. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach is efficient and should work within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
