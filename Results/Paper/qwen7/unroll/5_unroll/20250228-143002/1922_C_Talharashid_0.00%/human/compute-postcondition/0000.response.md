Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. Other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, `y_i`) are not affected.**

This means that `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, constrained between 1 and 10^4, while the other variables remain in their initial undefined state, awaiting further input or assignment.
