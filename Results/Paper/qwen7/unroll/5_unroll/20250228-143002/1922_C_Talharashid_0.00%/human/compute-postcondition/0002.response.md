Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each iteration i (0 ≤ i < t), there are two dictionaries d1 and d2 containing integer keys and integer values. The variable m is an integer input between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each query j (0 ≤ j < m), there are two integers start and end representing the query range, with start and end being adjusted by subtracting 1. After processing all queries, the output consists of m lines, each containing the minimum value of s1 and s2 calculated for each query.
