Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `s` is initialized to 0.
   - `m` is initialized to 1.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
   - In each iteration:
     - `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. This represents the count of cards that will be laid down in the current step (odd, twice odd, three times odd, etc.).
     - `n` is halved (`n //= 2`), effectively moving to the next step (next multiple).
     - If `k` falls within the range `[s, s + x]`, the loop breaks, indicating the correct step is found.
     - Otherwise, `s` is updated by adding `x`, and `m` is doubled (`m *= 2`).

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - After finding the correct step, the program calculates the `k`-th card using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.
