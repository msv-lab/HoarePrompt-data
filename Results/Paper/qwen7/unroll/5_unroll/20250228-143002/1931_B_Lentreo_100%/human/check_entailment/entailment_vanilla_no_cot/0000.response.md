Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sum Calculation and Mean Determination**: For each test case, it calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'NO' because it's impossible to distribute the water equally.
3. **Distribution Feasibility Check**: It then checks if it's feasible to redistribute the water so that each container ends up with the mean amount of water. This is done by maintaining a running difference (`curr`) between the current total and the target total (which would be `n * mean`). If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means there isn't enough water in the earlier containers to balance out the later ones, hence returning 'NO'. If the loop completes without finding such a situation, it returns 'YES'.

Given these points, the provided code accurately solves the problem as described.
