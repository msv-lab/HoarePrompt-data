### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Sum Divisibility Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the total sum of water in all containers is divisible by \( n \). This is crucial because if the total sum is not divisible by \( n \), it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water. The program immediately returns 'NO' in this case, which is correct.

2. **Mean Calculation**:
   - If the total sum is divisible by \( n \), the program calculates the mean amount of water each container should have. This is done using `mean = total // n`.

3. **Balance Check**:
   - The program then iterates through each container, maintaining a running sum `curr` of the differences between the current amount of water and the mean. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means there is an imbalance that cannot be corrected, and the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

This approach is sound and aligns with the problem requirements. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic needed to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and accurately implements the solution to the problem.
