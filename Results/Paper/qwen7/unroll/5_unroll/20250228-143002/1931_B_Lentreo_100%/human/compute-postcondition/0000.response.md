Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container, `n` is the length of `nums`.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(nums)` calculates the length of the list `nums` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `nums` remains unchanged, and now `n` holds the number of elements in `nums`.
