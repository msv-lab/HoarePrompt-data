State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `_` is not relevant as it is a dummy variable**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t` and the dummy variable `_`.
- The dummy variable `_` is used to iterate over the range and does not hold any specific state that needs adjustment.
- The variable `t` determines whether the loop will execute. Since `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, it must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
