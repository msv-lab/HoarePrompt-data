Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it also accepts integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the test cases based on the given constraints.**

This means the function `func` accepts an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it further accepts three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` containing `n` integers. The function processes these inputs according to the specified constraints but does not return any value directly.
