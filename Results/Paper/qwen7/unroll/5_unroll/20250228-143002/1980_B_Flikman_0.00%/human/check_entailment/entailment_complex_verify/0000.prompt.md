You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' based on the conditions evaluated within each iteration of the loop. For each input set, the program first reads an integer `t`, then iterates `t` times. During each iteration, it reads three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers `a`. It then determines the favorite value (the `(f-1)`th element in `a`), counts how many elements are the same as the favorite value (`same_value_count`), and counts how many elements are greater than the favorite value (`greater_count`). Based on these counts, it prints 'YES' if there are at least `k` elements greater than the favorite value, 'NO' if the sum of elements equal to and greater than the favorite value does not meet or exceed `k`, and 'MAYBE' otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It identifies the favorite value as the `(f-1)`th element in `a`. It then counts how many elements in `a` are the same as the favorite value and how many are greater than the favorite value. Based on these counts, it prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each test case. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining whether the favorite cube will be removed does not account for the exact positions of the cubes after sorting.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```
- Expected Output: `MAYBE`

However, the program will incorrectly output `YES` because it checks the count of cubes with the same value and the count of cubes with greater values but does not correctly simulate the sorting and removal process.

To illustrate, let's break down the steps:
1. The original list is `[4, 3, 3, 2, 3]`.
2. After sorting, it becomes `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`.
3. The favorite cube (value 3) is now in the second position.
4. The program checks:
   - `greater_count` (cubes with values greater than 3): 1 (only the 4).
   - `same_value_count` (cubes with the same value as the favorite cube): 3.
5. Since `greater_count` (1) is less than `k` (2), and `greater_count + same_value_count` (1 + 3 = 4) is greater than `k` (2), the program incorrectly prints `MAYBE`.

The correct logic would involve simulating the sorting and checking the exact position of the favorite cube after sorting and removing the first `k` cubes. The current implementation does not accurately reflect this process.
