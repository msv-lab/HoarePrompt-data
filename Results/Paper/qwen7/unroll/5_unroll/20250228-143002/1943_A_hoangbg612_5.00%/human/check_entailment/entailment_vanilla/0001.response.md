Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the game logic and calculates the MEX of the array `c` optimally.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the elements of the array `N`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted. This step is unnecessary for determining the MEX but might be intended for some other purpose.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `cur` is initialized to -1.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count the occurrences of each number in the array `N`.

4. **Processing the Array:**
   - The program iterates through each number in the sorted array `N`.
   - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - If the sum of counts in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur`.
   - It then iterates from 0 to `cur` to find the smallest number `i` such that the count of `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. This value of `i` is printed as the result.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the MEX by counting the occurrences of each number and then finding the smallest number missing. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the game's turns and the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob.
   - The program does not account for the fact that Alice can choose any element from the array, and Bob can only remove elements without appending them to `c`.

2. **Game Strategy Not Implemented:**
   - The program does not implement the optimal strategy for both players. It assumes that the game can be reduced to counting occurrences, which is not true given the game rules.

3. **Output Mismatch:**
   - The output for the given examples does not match the expected results. For instance, for the input `[0, 0, 1, 1]`, the expected output is `2`, but the program outputs `1`.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and does not produce the correct MEX values for the given test cases.

**Correctness: **False**
