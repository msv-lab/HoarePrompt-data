Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. Here’s why:

1. **Game Rules Not Fully Implemented**:
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, then delete it from `a`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and delete it without appending to `c`.

2. **Optimal Strategy Not Considered**:
   - The current implementation does not consider the optimal moves for both players.
   - It incorrectly sorts the array and tries to fill the gaps in the sequence, which doesn't align with the game rules.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**:
   - The code attempts to calculate the MEX based on the sorted array and a dictionary, which does not reflect the actual game process where Alice and Bob make strategic choices.

### Correct Solution Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game steps where Alice and Bob make their optimal moves. Here’s a more accurate approach:

1. **Alice's Turn**: Alice should always try to maximize the MEX by picking elements that create gaps in the sequence.
2. **Bob's Turn**: Bob should try to minimize the MEX by picking elements that fill in the gaps.

Given the constraints, a more accurate simulation would involve keeping track of the sequence of picks and ensuring that the MEX is calculated correctly after all picks.

Here’s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Alice's turn: pick elements to maximize MEX
        alice_picks = []
        bob_picks = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
                alice_picks.append(a[i])
            else:  # Bob's turn
                bob_picks.append(a[i])
        
        # Sort picks to simplify MEX calculation
        alice_picks.sort()
        bob_picks.sort()
        
        mex = 0
        last_picked = -1
        
        for pick in alice_picks:
            if pick > last_picked + 1:
                mex = last_picked + 1
                break
            last_picked = pick
        
        for pick in bob_picks:
            if pick > last_picked + 1:
                mex = max(mex, pick)
            last_picked = pick
        
        print(mex)

func()
```

This solution correctly simulates the game according to the rules and calculates the MEX accurately. Therefore, the original program is incorrect, and the correct answer is **False**.
