Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `T` is read as the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `S` (which should be `N`) is read as the size of the array.
   - `N` is read as the array elements and sorted.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `cur` is initialized to -1.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the count of each number in the array.

3. **Processing the Array:**
   - Iterate through the sorted array `N`.
   - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, check if it can be placed in the sequence without breaking the sequence.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, increment `cur` and break out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, update `cur` to `num` and set `M[cur]` to 1.
   - If the current number `num` is not greater than `cur`, increment the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

4. **Final Adjustment:**
   - Check if the sum of values in `M` equals `S`. If so, increment `cur` by 1.
   - Iterate through the keys of `M` to find the largest key `i` such that `M[i] <= i`. Set `cur` to this value.

5. **Output:**
   - Print `cur`, which represents the MEX of the final array `c`.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Sorting and Processing:**
   - Sorting the array helps in maintaining a sequence where we can place numbers in increasing order.
   - The logic of updating `cur` and checking conditions ensures that the sequence is maintained as much as possible.

2. **Dictionary Usage:**
   - Using a dictionary `M` to count occurrences of each number helps in determining the MEX efficiently.

3. **Final Adjustment:**
   - The final adjustment step ensures that if the sum of counts equals the size of the array, we increment `cur` by 1, which is necessary to handle edge cases.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where the array might not allow placing numbers in a strictly increasing sequence due to duplicates or gaps.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal MEX value for the given game scenario. It processes the input array, maintains a sequence, and adjusts the result based on the counts of numbers.

**Correctness: True**
