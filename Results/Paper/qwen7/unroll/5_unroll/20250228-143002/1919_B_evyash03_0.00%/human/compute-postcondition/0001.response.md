Output State: **`count` is 0, `balance` is 0, `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", and length is an integer representing the length of the string expression such that 1 <= length <= 5000.**

The code initializes the variable `balance` to 0. The initial values of `count`, `expression`, and `length` remain unchanged. Therefore, `count` is still 0, `balance` is now 0, `expression` remains a string of "+" and "-", and `length` remains an integer representing the length of the string expression.
