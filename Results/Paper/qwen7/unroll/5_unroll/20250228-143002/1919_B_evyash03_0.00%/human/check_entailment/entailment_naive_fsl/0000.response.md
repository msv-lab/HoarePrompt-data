Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not consider the optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the total penalty. Instead, it seems to be counting the number of times the balance goes negative, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

For example, consider the input:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
The expected output is `4`, but the program would incorrectly output `1`.

The program splits the string into parts based on the '-' character and then calculates a count related to the balance of '+' and '-' characters, which does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array.
