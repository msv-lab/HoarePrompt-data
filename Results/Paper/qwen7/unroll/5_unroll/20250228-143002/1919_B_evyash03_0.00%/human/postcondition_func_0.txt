The function accepts a string `expression` consisting of characters "+" and "-" and an integer `length` representing the length of `expression`. It counts the number of times the balance (initially set to 0) goes negative while iterating through each character in `expression`. If the final balance is greater than 0, it adds 1 to the count. The function returns this final count.
