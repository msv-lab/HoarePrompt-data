Output State: **The program returns the number of times `balance` became negative plus 1 if `balance` is greater than 0**

Explanation: Initially, `count` represents the number of times `balance` became negative. The code snippet returns `count + (balance > 0)`. Since `balance` is initially 0, the condition `(balance > 0)` evaluates to `False`, which is equivalent to `0`. Therefore, the return value is simply `count + 0`, which is `count`. However, the description specifies that if `balance` is greater than 0, it should add 1 to `count`. Given that `balance` starts at 0, the return value is `count` plus 1 if `balance` becomes positive at any point during the evaluation of the string `expression`.
