Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: According to the given information, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and it is guaranteed that `1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer input, it will always be greater than or equal to 1, ensuring the loop can execute.

4. **Adjusting the State**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` itself. It should be set to a value within the specified range (1 to 2⋅10^4) to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^4 inclusive**
