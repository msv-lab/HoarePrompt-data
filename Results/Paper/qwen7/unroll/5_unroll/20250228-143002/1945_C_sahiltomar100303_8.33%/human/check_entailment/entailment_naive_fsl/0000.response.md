Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the optimal position for the road is exactly at the middle of the village, i.e., `i = n // 2`. According to the problem description, if there are multiple suitable positions with the minimum `|n/2 - i|`, the smaller one should be chosen. However, the program does not check if `i = n // 2` is a valid position and does not ensure that it returns the smaller value in case of ties.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
111
```
The expected output is `1`, but the program might return `2` because it does not explicitly check if `i = n // 2` is a valid position and does not handle ties correctly. This can be seen in the logic where the program decides between `left` and `right` without considering the exact middle position.
