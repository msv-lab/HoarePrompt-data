Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` (0 <= `a_i` < `n`) represents the number of previous indices with the same character in the string. The function returns a string `s` containing characters from 'a' to 'z', where each character appears a number of times equal to its corresponding value in the list `a`.**
