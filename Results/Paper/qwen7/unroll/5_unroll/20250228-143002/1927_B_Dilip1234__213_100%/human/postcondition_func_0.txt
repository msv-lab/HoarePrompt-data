The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n`. It constructs a string `s` containing characters from 'a' to 'z', where each character appears a number of times equal to its corresponding value in the list `a`. After executing the function, the program returns the string `s`.
