Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly identifies the positions of '1's and '0's in the binary string `s`.
   - It calculates the cost for each substring that starts with a '1' and ends just before a '0', which is essentially the length of the substring (i.e., `n + 1`).
   - The logic is sound for calculating the cost of making the string sorted using cyclic shifts, as each such substring represents a part of the string that needs to be moved to its correct position.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1()` is called `t` times and each call processes a binary string independently, the overall logic is correct for handling multiple test cases.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The main function `if __name__ == '__main__': func_2()` correctly initializes the process by calling `func_2()`.
   - `func_2()` ensures that the correct number of test cases are processed, and `func_1()` is applied to each binary string.

Given the analysis, both functions together correctly implement the solution to the problem statement. Therefore, the program meets the requirements and is correct.

Correctness: **True**
