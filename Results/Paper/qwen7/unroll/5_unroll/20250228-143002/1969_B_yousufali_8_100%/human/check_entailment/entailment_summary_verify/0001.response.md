### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. A cyclic shift of a substring costs the length of that substring.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a binary string `s` as input.
   - It initializes `n` to count consecutive '1's and `ans` to accumulate the cost.
   - It iterates through the string:
     - If the current character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans` and resets `n`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is indeed flawed because it does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.
   - The function `func_1` assumes that every '0' encountered after a sequence of '1's will require a cyclic shift of the entire sequence of '1's plus the '0'. This is not always the case. For example, in the string "101011", the function would incorrectly calculate the cost as 5, but the correct cost is 9 as explained in the problem statement.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For "10", the function correctly calculates the cost as 2.
   - For "0000", the function correctly calculates the cost as 0.
   - For "11000", the function would incorrectly calculate the cost as 4 instead of 3.
   - For "101011", the function would incorrectly calculate the cost as 5 instead of 9.
   - For "01101001", the function would incorrectly calculate the cost as 8 instead of 11.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.

6. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_2` processes a specified number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case. Since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not accurately calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
