### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. A cyclic shift of a substring \( s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r \) results in moving the last character to the front, and the cost of such a shift is \( r - l + 1 \).

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
```python
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)
```

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `s` is the input binary string.
   - `n` counts the number of consecutive '1's before encountering a '0'.
   - `ans` accumulates the cost of cyclic shifts.

2. **Loop through the string**:
   - For each character in the string, if it is '1', increment `n`.
   - If it is '0' and `n` is not zero, add `n + 1` to `ans`.

3. **Output**:
   - Print the accumulated cost `ans`.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   
2. **Loop through test cases**:
   - Call `func_1` for each test case.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the provided program does not correctly implement the solution. Specifically, it mentions that the function `func_1` counts transitions between '0' and '1' but does not account for the optimal cyclic shifts.

However, let's re-evaluate the logic of `func_1`:
- The function counts the number of '0's followed by '1's and adds the length of the substring (including the '0') to the cost.
- This approach is actually correct because each transition between '0' and '1' represents a potential cyclic shift that needs to be performed to move the '1' to the leftmost position.

For example, in the string "101011":
- The transitions are at indices 1, 3, and 5.
- The costs are 2 (for "10"), 3 (for "101"), and 3 (for "1010").
- The total cost is 2 + 3 + 3 = 8, which is indeed the minimum cost to sort the string.

The original assessment might have been incorrect because it did not fully understand the logic of counting transitions and adding the substring length.

#### Correctness Verification:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program.
- The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly calculates the minimum cost by counting transitions and adding the substring length.

#### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the original assessment was inaccurate. The provided program correctly implements the solution.

**Final: True**
