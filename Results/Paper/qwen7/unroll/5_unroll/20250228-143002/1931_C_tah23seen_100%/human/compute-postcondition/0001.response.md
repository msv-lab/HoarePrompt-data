Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the length of `arr`, and `arr` is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and n inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(arr)` calculates the length of the list `arr` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The precondition that `arr` is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, is still valid.
