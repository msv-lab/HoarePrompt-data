### Reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func()` is intended to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and print the result.
2. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading a time in the format `hh:mm`.
3. **Hour Conversion Logic**: The original code uses a series of `if-elif` statements to manually convert the hour from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and set the AM/PM indicator. This approach is indeed inefficient and redundant, but it does work correctly for all valid inputs within the given constraints.
4. **Edge Cases**: The original code handles edge cases such as `00` and `12` correctly by converting them to `12` in the 12-hour format and setting the appropriate AM/PM indicator.
5. **Output Format**: The original code prints the converted time in the correct format, with the hour and minute separated by a colon and the AM/PM indicator at the end.

While the original code is not the most efficient or concise, it does correctly implement the required functionality. The provided function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, and the original assessment correctly points out the inefficiencies but fails to recognize that the code still works correctly.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The original function, despite being inefficient and redundant, correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and prints the results in the specified format. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate in concluding that the function is incorrect.
