Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it splits the input string `s` into `h` (hour) and `m` (minute).
3. The logic for converting the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format is implemented using a series of `if-elif` statements. This logic covers all possible values of `h` from `00` to `23` and correctly assigns the appropriate `h1` and `time`.
4. The conversion handles both the transition from `12` to `12` (PM) and from `00` to `12` (PM), which are correctly managed in the code.
5. The output format matches the required format of "hh:mm AM/PM".

Given the above points, the program appears to handle all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
