### Reasoning:

1. **Function Design**: The function `func()` aims to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, which includes converting the hour part and appending the appropriate AM/PM indicator.

2. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input by reading an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases each containing a time in the format `hh:mm`.

3. **Hour Conversion Logic**:
   - The original code uses a series of `if-elif` statements to manually convert the hour part from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. This approach is indeed repetitive and can be simplified.
   - The annotated code shows that the hour is correctly converted to the 12-hour format, and the AM/PM indicator is set appropriately based on the original hour.

4. **AM/PM Indicator**:
   - The original code correctly sets the AM/PM indicator based on the hour. If the hour is between 13 and 23, it sets `time` to 'PM'; otherwise, it sets `time` to 'AM'.
   - The annotated code confirms that the AM/PM indicator is set correctly.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The original code prints the time in the required format `h1 : m  time`, which matches the problem statement.
   - The annotated code confirms that the output is formatted correctly.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - While the original code is repetitive and could be simplified, it does not contain any logical errors or incorrect conversions. The use of modulo arithmetic in the proposed corrected version is more efficient but is not necessary for correctness.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The original code correctly handles edge cases such as `00` being converted to `12` and `12` being converted to `12`.

### Conclusion:
The original code, despite its inefficiencies and redundancy, correctly converts the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and sets the appropriate AM/PM indicator. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate because the original code is logically correct, even though it can be simplified.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
