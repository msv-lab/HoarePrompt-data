Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `number`, a positive integer within the range [2, 10^18], and `sequence`, a list of integers where each element is within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. The function returns a tuple (0, 0).**

This means the function takes a positive integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence` as inputs and always returns the tuple (0, 0) regardless of the values of `number` and the contents of `sequence`.
