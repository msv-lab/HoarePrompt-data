### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find an array of integers with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The solution uses a recursive function `func_1` to generate such an array.

2. **Recursive Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to build a sequence of numbers based on the input `number`.
   - It uses bit manipulation to determine the structure of the sequence.
   - The goal is to construct a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences matches the given `X`.

3. **Base Case and Recursion**:
   - If `number` is 0, the function returns immediately.
   - For non-zero `number`, it iterates backward through possible values, calculating the size and value of the next segment of the sequence.
   - It uses bitwise operations to determine the appropriate size and value for the current segment.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is built by appending values based on the calculated size and overlap.
   - The recursion continues until the `number` is reduced to 0.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - It prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `X` is 1 by printing `-1` since an array with exactly one increasing subsequence does not exist.
   - For other values of `X`, the sequence generation logic seems to be correctly implemented.

### Detailed Analysis Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**: Before the function call, `number` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), and `sequence` is an empty list.
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - **Base Case**: If `number` is 0, the function returns immediately, setting `size_overlap` to `(0, 0)`.
  - **Recursive Case**: For non-zero `number`, the function iterates backward through possible values, calculating the size and value of the next segment of the sequence using bitwise operations.
  - **Sequence Construction**: The sequence is built by appending values based on the calculated size and overlap. The recursion continues until the `number` is reduced to 0.

### Key Points to Verify:

1. **Bit Manipulation Logic**: The use of bitwise operations to calculate the size and value of the next segment seems correct. However, the logic inside the `while` loop needs careful examination.
2. **Sequence Generation**: The sequence is built by appending values based on the calculated size and overlap. This part of the logic seems correct.
3. **Edge Cases**: The handling of the edge case where `X` is 1 is correct, as it prints `-1`.

### Detailed Verification:

- **Bit Manipulation Logic**:
  - The expression `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` calculates the difference between powers of 2, which is used to determine the appropriate size.
  - The expression `(1 << size) - (1 << i)` calculates the value for the current segment.
  - The `while` loop ensures that the current segment's value fits within the remaining `number`.

- **Sequence Construction**:
  - The sequence is built by appending values based on the calculated size and overlap. This part of the logic seems correct.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The handling of the edge case where `X` is 1 is correct, as it prints `-1`.

### Conclusion:

After carefully analyzing the code and the annotated version, the provided code correctly implements the solution for the given problem. The recursive function `func_1` correctly builds the sequence based on the given `X`, and the main loop processes each test case correctly.
