### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find an array of integers with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The solution uses a recursive function `func_1` to generate such an array.

2. **Recursive Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to build a sequence of numbers based on the input `number`.
   - It uses bit manipulation to determine the structure of the sequence.
   - The goal is to construct a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences matches the given `X`.

3. **Base Case and Recursion**:
   - If `number` is 0, the function returns immediately.
   - For non-zero `number`, it iterates backward through possible values, calculating the size and value of the next segment of the sequence.
   - It uses bitwise operations to determine the appropriate size and value for the current segment.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is built by appending values based on the calculated size and overlap.
   - The recursion continues until the `number` is reduced to 0.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - It prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `X` is 1 by printing `-1` since an array with exactly one increasing subsequence does not exist.
   - For other values of `X`, the sequence generation logic seems to be correctly implemented.

### Verification:
- The provided code appears to follow the logic needed to generate the required sequence.
- The recursive function `func_1` correctly builds the sequence based on the given `X`.
- The main loop correctly processes each test case and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided code seems to correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
