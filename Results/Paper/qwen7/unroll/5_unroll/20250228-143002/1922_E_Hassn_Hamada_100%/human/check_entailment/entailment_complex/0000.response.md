Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate an array of integers such that the number of its increasing subsequences is exactly \(X\). The solution involves a recursive function to construct such an array.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence based on the input number.
   - It uses bitwise operations to determine the size and value of the sequence elements.
   - The function recursively constructs the sequence by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems until it reaches the base case where `number` is 0.

3. **Recursive Breakdown**:
   - The function starts with the largest possible value for the current position in the sequence and checks if it fits within the remaining `number`.
   - If the value fits, it updates the sequence and recursively processes the remaining part of `number`.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is built by appending values that ensure the number of increasing subsequences matches the target \(X\).
   - The sequence construction ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is calculated correctly using the properties of binary representation and bitwise operations.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \(X = 2\), the sequence `[0]` is generated, which has exactly one increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`).
   - For larger \(X\), the sequence is constructed to have the exact number of increasing subsequences as specified.

6. **Output Validation**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.
   - The sequence is validated to ensure it meets the criteria of having exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
