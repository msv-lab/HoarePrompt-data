Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving integers n, k, P_B, P_S, a permutation p of length n, and an array a of n integers. For each test case, it determines whether 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' is the outcome based on specific conditions related to the values in arrays a and p. The function prints the result for each test case and does not return any value.**
