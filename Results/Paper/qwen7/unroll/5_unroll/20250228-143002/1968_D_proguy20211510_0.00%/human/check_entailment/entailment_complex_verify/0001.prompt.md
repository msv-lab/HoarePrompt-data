You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: The output state depends on the input provided during each iteration of the loop. Since no specific inputs are given, we cannot determine a concrete output state. However, the output will be either 'Draw', 'Bodya', or 'Sasha' based on the conditions inside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving integers n, k, P_B, P_S, a permutation p of length n, and an array a of n integers. For each test case, it determines whether 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' is the outcome based on specific conditions related to the values in arrays a and p. The function prints the result for each test case and does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` (starting positions for Bodya and Sasha).
   - It also reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - The program checks if `a[pb-1]` and `a[ps-1]` are equal to the maximum value in `a`. If they are, it prints 'Draw' and continues to the next test case.
   - This handles the scenario where both players have the highest possible score from their initial positions.

3. **Game Strategy Calculation**:
   - The program initializes two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha respectively.
   - It then iterates through `k` turns, updating the scores based on the current positions and the rules of the game.
   - If `a[pb-1]` equals the maximum value, it adds the maximum value to `b` and updates `pb` to `p[pb-1]`.
   - Similarly, if `a[ps-1]` equals the maximum value, it adds the maximum value to `s` and updates `ps` to `p[ps-1]`.
   - If neither condition is met, it simply appends the current score to both lists and updates the positions accordingly.

4. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix sums for both `b` and `s` to efficiently compute the total score for each player over the remaining turns.

5. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - It computes the final scores for both players by adding the remaining score (calculated using the prefix sums) to the accumulated scores.
   - It then compares these final scores to determine the winner.

### Correctness Check

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The logic for checking if both players start with the maximum value is correct and should handle the 'Draw' scenario appropriately.

2. **Game Strategy Calculation**:
   - The logic for updating positions and scores is correct. However, there is a potential issue in the handling of the game strategy.
   - The program assumes that the players will always stay at their current positions if they do not have the maximum value, which might not be optimal. The problem requires both players to try to maximize their scores, and the current implementation does not fully account for this.

3. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The prefix sum calculation and final score computation are correct and handle the remaining turns properly.

### Conclusion

The program does not fully account for the optimal strategy for both players to maximize their scores. The current implementation assumes that players will not move if they do not have the maximum value, which might not lead to the best outcome. Therefore, the program might not always produce the correct result.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
