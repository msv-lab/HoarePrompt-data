### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program's logic regarding the optimal strategy for both players. Specifically, the program assumes that players will not move if they do not have the maximum value, which is not necessarily true. Both players should aim to maximize their scores by strategically moving to positions with high values, even if those positions are not initially occupied by the maximum value.

To validate this, let's carefully examine the annotated code and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The program correctly handles the 'Draw' scenario when both players start with the maximum value.

2. **Game Strategy Calculation**:
   - The program updates the scores and positions based on the current values and moves to the next position in the permutation.
   - However, the program does not consider the possibility that players might move to other positions to maximize their scores. For instance, if a player has a lower value but can move to a position with a higher value, they should do so to maximize their score.

3. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The prefix sum calculation and final score computation are correct and handle the remaining turns properly.

Given the problem statement, both players are trying to win the game, meaning they will make strategic moves to maximize their scores. The current implementation does not account for these strategic moves, leading to potentially incorrect outcomes.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not fully implement the optimal strategy required by the problem, and thus it might not produce the correct results in all scenarios.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
