Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` (starting positions for Bodya and Sasha).
   - It also reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - The program checks if `a[pb-1]` and `a[ps-1]` are equal to the maximum value in `a`. If they are, it prints 'Draw' and continues to the next test case.
   - This handles the scenario where both players have the highest possible score from their initial positions.

3. **Game Strategy Calculation**:
   - The program initializes two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha respectively.
   - It then iterates through `k` turns, updating the scores based on the current positions and the rules of the game.
   - If `a[pb-1]` equals the maximum value, it adds the maximum value to `b` and updates `pb` to `p[pb-1]`.
   - Similarly, if `a[ps-1]` equals the maximum value, it adds the maximum value to `s` and updates `ps` to `p[ps-1]`.
   - If neither condition is met, it simply appends the current score to both lists and updates the positions accordingly.

4. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix sums for both `b` and `s` to efficiently compute the total score for each player over the remaining turns.

5. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - It computes the final scores for both players by adding the remaining score (calculated using the prefix sums) to the accumulated scores.
   - It then compares these final scores to determine the winner.

### Correctness Check

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The logic for checking if both players start with the maximum value is correct and should handle the 'Draw' scenario appropriately.

2. **Game Strategy Calculation**:
   - The logic for updating positions and scores is correct. However, there is a potential issue in the handling of the game strategy.
   - The program assumes that the players will always stay at their current positions if they do not have the maximum value, which might not be optimal. The problem requires both players to try to maximize their scores, and the current implementation does not fully account for this.

3. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The prefix sum calculation and final score computation are correct and handle the remaining turns properly.

### Conclusion

The program does not fully account for the optimal strategy for both players to maximize their scores. The current implementation assumes that players will not move if they do not have the maximum value, which might not lead to the best outcome. Therefore, the program might not always produce the correct result.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
