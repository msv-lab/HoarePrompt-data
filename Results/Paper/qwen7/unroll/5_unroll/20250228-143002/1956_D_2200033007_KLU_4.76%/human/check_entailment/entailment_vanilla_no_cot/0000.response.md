Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually implement the logic to solve the problem correctly. The function `func_1` hardcodes the output for specific conditions without actually performing any operations to maximize the sum of the array elements. The program does not read the actual array values from the input and does not perform the operations to change the array elements as per the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
