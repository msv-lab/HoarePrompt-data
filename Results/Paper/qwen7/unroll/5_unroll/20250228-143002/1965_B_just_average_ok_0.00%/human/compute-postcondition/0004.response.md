Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( k \). For each test case, it constructs a list `nums` containing specific values derived from \( k \) and prints the length of `nums` followed by its elements. The list `nums` always contains 25 elements and includes powers of 2 up to the highest power less than or equal to \( k \), along with \( k - 2^{\text{idx}} \), \( k + 1 \), and \( k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1 \), where \( \text{idx} \) is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \).**
