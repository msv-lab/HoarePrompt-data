Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating the Sequence:**
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\) (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 8388608]`).
   - It then finds the index `idx` such that \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
   - It removes this power of 2 from the list.
   - It appends three new values to the list:
     - `k - 2^{\text{idx}}`
     - `k + 1`
     - `k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1`

3. **Output:**
   - The length of the resulting list `nums` is printed.
   - The elements of the list `nums` are printed.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - The sequence includes `k - 2^{\text{idx}}`, which ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` because any subsequence containing `k - 2^{\text{idx}}` would require an additional element to reach `k`, but the additional element would make the sum exceed `k`.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`:**
   - The sequence includes all powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\), which allows forming any sum from 1 to \(2^{24} - 1\).
   - By removing one power of 2 and adding specific values, the sequence can still form all sums from 1 to `n` except `k`.

3. **Sequence Size Constraint:**
   - The sequence is constructed using up to 25 elements (`24` powers of 2 plus 1 additional value).

### Example Verification:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `2 2`
  - Output: `1 1`
  - Explanation: The sequence `[1]` ensures no subsequence sums to 2, and it can form a subsequence summing to 1.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `6 1`
  - Output: `5 2 3 4 5 6`
  - Explanation: The sequence `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` ensures no subsequence sums to 1, and it can form subsequences summing to 2 through 6.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `8 8`
  - Output: `7 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Explanation: The sequence `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` ensures no subsequence sums to 8, and it can form subsequences summing to 1 through 7.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `9 3`
  - Output: `4 7 1 4`
  - Explanation: The sequence `[7, 1, 4]` ensures no subsequence sums to 3, and it can form subsequences summing to 1, 4, and 7.

- **Example 5:**
  - Input: `10 7`
  - Output: `4 1 2 8 3`
  - Explanation: The sequence `[1, 2, 8, 3]` ensures no subsequence sums to 7, and it can form subsequences summing to 1, 2, 3, and 8.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly generates a sequence that meets all the problem requirements. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
