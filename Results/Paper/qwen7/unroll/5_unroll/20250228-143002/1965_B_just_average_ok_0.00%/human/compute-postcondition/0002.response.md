Output State: t test cases are processed, and for each test case, the length of the list `nums` and the elements in `nums` are printed. The list `nums` contains the following elements after processing each test case: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216, k - 2^idx, k + 1, k + 2^idx + 1], where `k` is the second input number for each test case and `idx` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. The length of `nums` is 25 for each test case.
