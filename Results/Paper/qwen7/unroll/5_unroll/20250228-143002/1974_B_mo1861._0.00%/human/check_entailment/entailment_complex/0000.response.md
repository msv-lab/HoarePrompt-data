Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly constructs the `char_map` dictionary. For each unique character in the sorted set of `b`, it maps it to a character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the position of the character in the sorted set. This is done correctly by calculating the position as `(len(b) - i - 1)` where `i` is the index of the character in the sorted set.
2. The function then iterates through each character in `b`, uses the `char_map` to find the corresponding character in the original string `s`, and constructs the decoded string `s`.
3. Given the problem statement and the provided example, the function correctly decodes the string `b` into the original string `s`.

Therefore, the function `func_1` correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
