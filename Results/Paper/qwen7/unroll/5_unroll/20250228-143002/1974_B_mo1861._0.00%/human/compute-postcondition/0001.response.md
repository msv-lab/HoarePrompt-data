Output State: **`char_map` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `char_map`. This dictionary will be used later to map characters from the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`. Since no values are assigned to `char_map` in this snippet, it remains an empty dictionary. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
