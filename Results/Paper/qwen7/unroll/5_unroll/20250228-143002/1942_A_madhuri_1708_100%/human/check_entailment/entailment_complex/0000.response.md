Reasoning:

The annotated program does not correctly address the problem statement. Let's break down the requirements and the program's logic:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to find an array \( a \) of length \( n \) such that exactly \( k \) out of its \( n \) cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - Each element \( a_i \) should be within the range \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \).

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program checks if \( k \geq 2 \).
     - If \( n = k \) and \( k \geq 2 \), it prints a line with \( k \) occurrences of \( k \).
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1`.
   - If \( k < 2 \), it prints a line with numbers from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Analysis**:
   - The program does not consider the requirement that exactly \( k \) cyclic shifts must be sorted. It only checks if \( n = k \) when \( k \geq 2 \) and prints a specific pattern, but it does not ensure that exactly \( k \) cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - For \( k < 2 \), it prints a simple sequence from 1 to \( n \), which does not necessarily meet the requirement of having exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
