Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`, and the expression `len(s)`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` will be used as the index to iterate over the string `s`.
   - The expression `len(s)` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. It will run from `0` to `len(s) - 1`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `i` should start at `0` because the loop starts with `i = 0`.
   - The expression `len(s)` should be known to determine the number of iterations. Since `n` is defined as the length of the string `s`, `len(s)` is equivalent to `n`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be `0`.
- `n` (which is `len(s)`) should be the length of the string `s`.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the length of the string `s`**.
