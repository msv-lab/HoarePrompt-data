Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The string `s` remains unchanged, and its properties (consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and being a balanced parentheses sequence) are preserved. The length of `s` is now stored in `n`.
