You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")`, ensuring it is a balanced parentheses sequence. It constructs a dictionary `d` to track the balance of parentheses up to each index in `s`. After processing, it sorts the dictionary items based on their balance values and constructs a new string `ans` by concatenating characters from `s` according to the sorted indices. Finally, it returns the string `ans` containing characters from `s` in the order specified by the sorted indices.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup:**
   ```python
   n = input()
   print(func_1(n))
   ```
   - The program reads the input string `s` and calls the function `func_1` with this string.
   
2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(s):
       n = len(s)
       ans = ''
       d = {}
       d[0] = 0
       for i in range(len(s)):
           if s[i] == '(':
               d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
           else:
               d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
       d.pop(n)
       d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
       for (i, j) in d:
           ans += s[i]
       return ans
   ```

   - **Initialization:**
     - `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
     - `ans` is initialized as an empty string to store the result.
     - `d` is a dictionary where keys are indices and values are the balance at those indices.
     - `d[0] = 0` initializes the balance at index 0.

   - **Computing Balance:**
     - A loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
     - The balance is stored in the dictionary `d` with the key being the index + 1.

   - **Removing Last Key:**
     - `d.pop(n)` removes the last key-value pair from the dictionary. Since the length of the string is `n`, this effectively removes the balance at the end of the string.

   - **Sorting Dictionary Items:**
     - `d.items()` returns a list of tuples (key, value).
     - `sorted(..., key=lambda x: x[1])` sorts these tuples by their second element (balance) in ascending order.
     - In case of ties, the original position (first element of the tuple) is used to break ties in descending order.

   - **Building Result String:**
     - The loop iterates over the sorted items and appends the corresponding character from the original string `s` to `ans`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Balance Calculation:**
   - The balance calculation is correct and stored in the dictionary `d`.

2. **Sorting Logic:**
   - The sorting logic is correct. It sorts the positions based on the balance and breaks ties using the original position.

3. **Result Construction:**
   - The result string `ans` is constructed by appending characters from the original string based on the sorted positions.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case of removing the last key from the dictionary, which is necessary to ensure the balance is correctly calculated up to the second-to-last character.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
