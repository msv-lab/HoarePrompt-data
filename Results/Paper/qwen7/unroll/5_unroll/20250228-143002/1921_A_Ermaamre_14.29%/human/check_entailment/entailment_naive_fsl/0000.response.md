Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square for all potential cases. Specifically, the program assumes that the sides of the square are aligned either horizontally or vertically between two pairs of points, but it does not consider the possibility that the sides could be aligned between different pairs of points. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
```
In this case, the square has sides aligned both horizontally and vertically between different pairs of points. The program would incorrectly calculate the side length as the difference between the y-coordinates of two points, which would be 2, leading to an area of 4 instead of the correct area of 4.

To fix this, the program needs to check all possible pairs of points to determine the side length of the square. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Find the maximum and minimum x and y values
        min_x = min(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        max_x = max(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        min_y = min(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        max_y = max(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y)
        
        # The area of the square is the side length squared
        print(side_length ** 2)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the side length of the square is correctly calculated by considering all possible pairs of points.
