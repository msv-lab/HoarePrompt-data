Output State: **a is an integer input from the user, and there are three more sets of coordinates (x_i, y_i) waiting to be input.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. Since the input is part of a larger set of inputs for coordinates of squares, the state of the other sets of coordinates remains unchanged. Therefore, there are still three more sets of coordinates (x_i, y_i) waiting to be input.
