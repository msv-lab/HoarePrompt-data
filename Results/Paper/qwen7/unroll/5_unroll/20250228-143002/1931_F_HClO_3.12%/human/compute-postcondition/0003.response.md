Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through multiple lines of data, where each test case consists of k lines, and each line contains n integers representing the order of participants seen by a specific user. The integers in each line are unique and range from 1 to n. For each test case, the function returns information based on the given constraints and relationships between n, k, and the integers in the lines.**

This means the function is designed to process a series of test cases, where each test case includes multiple lines of data. Each line within a test case contains a sequence of integers (participants' orders) seen by a user. The function validates that these integers meet the specified constraints and then processes this data according to the given rules.
