You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n⋅k ≤ 2⋅10^5. Each test case consists of k lines, where each line contains n integers representing the order of participants seen by a specific user. All integers in each line are unique and range from 1 to n.

    #State: The output state depends on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop. The final output will be 'yes' if the conditions within the loop are satisfied for all iterations, otherwise it will be 'no'. Each 'yes' or 'no' output is determined based on the comparison and insertion logic described in the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through multiple lines of data, where each test case consists of k lines, and each line contains n integers representing the order of participants seen by a specific user. The integers in each line are unique and range from 1 to n. For each test case, the function returns information based on the given constraints and relationships between n, k, and the integers in the lines.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
