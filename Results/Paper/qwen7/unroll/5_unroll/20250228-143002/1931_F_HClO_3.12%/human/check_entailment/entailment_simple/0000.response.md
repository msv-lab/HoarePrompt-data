Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m` (which should be `k` in the problem statement), and then reads the orders of participants for each user who posted a screenshot.

2. **Single Screenshot Case**: The program handles the case where only one screenshot is provided (`m == 1`) correctly by printing 'yes' and skipping further checks.

3. **Initial Comparison**: The program compares the initial segments of the two screenshots (`l11` and `l22`). If they are not equal, it prints 'no' and skips further checks, which is correct.

4. **Index Tracking**: The program tracks the indices where the two screenshots differ (`idx1` and `idx2`). This is used to insert the differing elements back into the correct positions in the lists.

5. **Insertion Logic**: The program inserts the differing elements back into the correct positions in the lists and continues to check subsequent screenshots. If the subsequent screenshots match the modified list after inserting the elements, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases like when the differing elements are at the same index or when more than two screenshots are provided and the elements need to be inserted based on further comparisons.

Given the above points, the program logic seems to correctly implement the solution to the problem. The program checks if there is a consistent order of participants that matches all the provided screenshots.

Correctness: **True**
