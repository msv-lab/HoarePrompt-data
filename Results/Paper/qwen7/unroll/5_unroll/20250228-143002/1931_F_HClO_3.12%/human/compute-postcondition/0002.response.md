Output State: **The output state depends on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop. The final output will be 'yes' if the conditions within the loop are satisfied for all iterations, otherwise it will be 'no'. Each 'yes' or 'no' output is determined based on the comparison and insertion logic described in the loop body.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the output will be 'yes' if all conditions are met for every iteration, and 'no' if any condition fails at any point. The exact sequence of 'yes' and 'no' outputs will vary based on the input values provided during each iteration.
