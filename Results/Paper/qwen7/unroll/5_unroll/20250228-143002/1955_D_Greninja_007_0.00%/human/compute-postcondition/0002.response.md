Output State: **`window_freq` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in list `a[:m]`, `b_freq` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in list `b`, `a` is a list of integers with length n, `b` is a list of integers with length m such that m <= n, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 <= k <= m, `good_subarrays` is 0.**

Explanation: The code creates a new Counter object `window_freq` that counts the frequency of each element in the sublist `a[:m]` of list `a`. The length of this sublist is `m`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
