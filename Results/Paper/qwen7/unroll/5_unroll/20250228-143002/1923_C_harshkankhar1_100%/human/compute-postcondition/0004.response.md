Output State: n is an integer, q is an integer, t is a positive integer, a is a list starting with 0 followed by integers, b is a list where each element b[i] (for i from 1 to n) is the sum of b[0] and the value 1 if a[i] > 1 or 2 otherwise.

This means that for each index `i` from 1 to `n`, the value of `b[i]` will be the cumulative sum of 1's and 2's based on the condition `a[i] > 1`. If `a[i]` is greater than 1, then 1 is added to the cumulative sum; otherwise, 2 is added.
