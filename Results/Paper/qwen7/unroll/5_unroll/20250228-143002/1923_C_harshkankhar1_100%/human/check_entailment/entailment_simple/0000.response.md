Reasoning:
1. The problem requires checking if a subarray is "good" based on specific conditions.
2. A subarray is considered "good" if there exists another array `b` of the same length such that:
   - The sum of elements in both arrays is equal.
   - No element in the subarray is the same in both arrays.
   - All elements in the array `b` are positive.
3. The solution uses a prefix sum approach to determine if a subarray can be "good". Specifically, it calculates the prefix sums of the array `a` and a derived array `b`.
4. The logic in the code checks if the difference between the prefix sums of the subarray can accommodate the necessary conditions for being "good".
5. The code correctly initializes the prefix sums and iterates through the queries, checking the conditions for each subarray.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is "good".

Correctness: **True**
