You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, each test case consists of n and q where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, an array c of length n where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and q queries each defined by a pair of integers l_i and r_i representing the borders of the subarray to check if it is good.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: Output State: n is an integer, q is an integer, t is a positive integer, a is a list starting with 0 followed by integers, b is a list where each element b[i] (for i from 1 to n) is the sum of b[0] and the value 1 if a[i] > 1 or 2 otherwise for all previous elements.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: a is a list of cumulative sums, b is a list where each element b[i] is the sum of b[0] and the value 1 if a[i] > 1 or 2 otherwise for all previous elements, n is an integer, q is an integer, t is a positive integer, the loop has executed q times with user inputs (x, y), and printed 'NO' if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y, otherwise printed 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs including a positive integer `t`, followed by pairs of integers `n` and `q` where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and `q` queries each defined by a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i` representing the borders of the subarray. For each query, it checks if the subarray from index `l_i` to `r_i` is "good" and returns a list of boolean values indicating whether each subarray is good or not.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
