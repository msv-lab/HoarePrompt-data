Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated input, `q` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated input, `t` is a positive integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the next input split into a list.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` that starts with 0 and is followed by integers obtained from the next input split into a list. The values of `n`, `q`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state.
