Output State: The output state consists of multiple lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO'. For each test case, if the conditions specified in the loop are met (i.e., the first row and last row are uniform but different, or the entire first and last rows are uniform but different), the output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, the output will be 'YES'. The number of lines is equal to the number of test cases provided as input.
