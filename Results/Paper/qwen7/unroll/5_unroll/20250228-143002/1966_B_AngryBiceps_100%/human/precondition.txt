t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the grid. The grid is represented as a list of n strings, each string containing m characters 'W' (white) and 'B' (black), representing the initial colors of the squares. The sum of n·m over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
