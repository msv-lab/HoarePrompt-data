Output State: **`index` is 2, `T` is an integer from the list `data` at position `index`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `index`, `T`, `n`, or `t`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
