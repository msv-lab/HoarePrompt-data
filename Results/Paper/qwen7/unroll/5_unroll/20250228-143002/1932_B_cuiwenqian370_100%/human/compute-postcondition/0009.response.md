Output State: **`index` is 2 + T, `T` is unchanged, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `results` is a list containing T elements, each element being the final value of `last_year` for each iteration of the loop. The code prints the contents of the `results` list, each element on a new line, followed by a newline character.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')` writes the contents of the `results` list to the standard output, with each element on a new line, and ends with a newline character. However, this operation does not change the values of the variables `index`, `T`, `n`, `t`, or `results`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values and the `results` list is printed but its content remains the same.
