Output State: **`index` is 1, `T` is an integer from the list `data` at position `index`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.**

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value from the list `data` at the current index (`index`) to the variable `T`. After this assignment, `index` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
