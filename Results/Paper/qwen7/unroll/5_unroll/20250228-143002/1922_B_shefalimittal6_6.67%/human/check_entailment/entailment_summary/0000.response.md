Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. However, there are some logical issues in the program's approach:

1. **Combination Calculation**: The program correctly calculates combinations using `math.comb` when there are at least 3 or 2 sticks of the same length. But this alone is not sufficient to ensure that the chosen sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

2. **Triangle Inequality Rule**: The program does not check whether the chosen sticks satisfy the triangle inequality rule, which states that for any three sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) of a triangle, the following must hold: \(a + b > c\), \(a + c > b\), and \(b + c > a\). Without this check, the program will count invalid combinations as valid.

3. **Combination Calculation for Non-Matching Sticks**: The calculation `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` assumes that any pair of sticks of the same length and any other stick can form a triangle, which is incorrect. This approach does not account for the triangle inequality rule.

Given these issues, the program will produce incorrect results because it does not properly enforce the triangle inequality rule.

Correctness: **False**
