Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of exponents `a`.
3. It uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each exponent.
4. The logic to calculate the number of ways to form a triangle is flawed:
   - It incorrectly assumes that any pair of sticks with the same length can form a triangle, which is not true since the triangle inequality must hold.
   - It calculates combinations without checking the triangle inequality condition (`a + b > c`, `a + c > b`, `b + c > a`), which is necessary to form a non-degenerate triangle.
5. The program does not check if the three chosen sticks satisfy the triangle inequality condition.

Given these points, the program will produce incorrect results because it does not ensure that the chosen sticks can actually form a triangle.

Correctness: **False**
