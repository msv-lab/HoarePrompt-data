The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It calculates the cumulative sum of the differences between consecutive non-zero numbers in the list. If this cumulative sum is zero, it prints 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function reads input from standard input and outputs the results for each test case to standard output.
