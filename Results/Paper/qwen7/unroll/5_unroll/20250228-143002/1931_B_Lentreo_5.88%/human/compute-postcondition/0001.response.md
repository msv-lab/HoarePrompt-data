Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` and `t`. The underscore `_` is a common convention used when a variable is not actually needed within the loop body. However, for the purpose of this task, we need to consider the state of `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: The initial state given is that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer and the loop runs `t` times, `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing. Therefore, `t` must be at least 1.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `t` must be at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be at least 1**
