Reasoning: 

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to understand why the original assessment is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires determining if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the operation is only allowed if the source container index is less than the destination container index.

### Correct Approach
To solve this problem correctly, we need to check if the average amount of water per container is an integer. This is because, after any series of operations, the total amount of water remains constant. If the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, it is possible to distribute the water evenly among all containers.

### Provided Solution Analysis
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by calculating the cumulative sum of the differences between each element and the last element in the list. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not check if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the provided solution:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the number of containers `n`.
   - Read the list of water amounts `nums`.
   - Initialize `last` with the last element of `nums`.
   - Initialize `curr` to 0.
   - Iterate through each element in `nums`:
     - If the element is non-zero, add the difference between the current element and `last` to `curr`.
   - If `curr` is zero, print 'YES'; otherwise, print 'NO'.

This approach does not correctly determine if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. Instead, it checks if the sum of the differences between each element and the last element is zero, which is not relevant to the problem.

### Corrected Solution
The corrected solution provided in the original assessment is correct. It checks if the average amount of water per container is an integer by summing the total water and dividing it by the number of containers. Here is the corrected code again for reference:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_water = sum(nums)
        avg_water = total_water / n
        
        # Check if the average water per container is an integer
        if avg_water.is_integer():
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate because the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The corrected solution provided in the original assessment is the correct approach.

Final: **False**
