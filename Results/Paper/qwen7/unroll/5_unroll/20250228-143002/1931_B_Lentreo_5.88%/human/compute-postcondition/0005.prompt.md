You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. It is guaranteed that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9, and the sum of a_i is divisible by n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        last = nums[-1]
        
        curr = 0
        
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of "YES" or "NO" printed for each of the t test cases. For each test case, "YES" is printed if the cumulative sum of non-zero differences between consecutive numbers in the list is zero, otherwise "NO" is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data through standard input. It reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and then reads `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function ensures the sum of `a_i` in each test case does not exceed 2⋅10^9 and is divisible by `n`. After processing all test cases, it outputs the result for each case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
