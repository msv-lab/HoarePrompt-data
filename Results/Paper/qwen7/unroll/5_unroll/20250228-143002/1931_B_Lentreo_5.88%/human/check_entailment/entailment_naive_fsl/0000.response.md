Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program checks if the sum of the differences between each element and the last element is zero, which is not a valid approach to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to check if the average amount of water per container (which is the total sum of water divided by the number of containers) is an integer. This is because, after any series of operations, the total amount of water remains constant, and if the sum of water is divisible by the number of containers, it is possible to distribute the water evenly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_water = sum(nums)
        avg_water = total_water / n
        
        # Check if the average water per container is an integer
        if avg_water.is_integer():
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected program checks if the average amount of water per container is an integer, which is the correct approach to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.
