### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to find the maximum beauty of the array \(a\) after rearranging its elements.
   - Beauty is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` sorts the array and then calculates the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the differences are minimized, leading to a lower bound on the beauty, but not necessarily the maximum beauty.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - Function `func_2` reads the input data, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` to compute the beauty.
   - However, `func_1` does not account for all possible rearrangements of the array to achieve the maximum beauty.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input: 
     ```
     1
     5
     100 54 80 43 90
     ```
   - The provided solution sorts the array and calculates the beauty as:
     \[
     |54 - 100| + |80 - 54| + |43 - 80| + |90 - 43| = 46 + 26 + 37 + 47 = 156
     \]
   - However, the maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the elements to `[43, 90, 100, 80, 54]`, which gives:
     \[
     |90 - 43| + |100 - 90| + |80 - 100| + |54 - 80| = 47 + 10 + 20 + 26 = 103
     \]
   - This shows that sorting the array does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases because it does not explore all possible rearrangements of the array to find the maximum beauty.
   - Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not always find the maximum possible beauty after rearranging the elements.
