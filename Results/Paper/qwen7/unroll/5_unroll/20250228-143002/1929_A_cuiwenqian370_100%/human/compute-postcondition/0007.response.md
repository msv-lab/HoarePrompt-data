Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `result` and the object `results`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `index` is given as `t * (n + 1)`, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1` for each test case based on the arrays provided in the input data.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the `results` list. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `results`, the state of `results` must be such that it contains at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `index` is not directly relevant to the loop's execution since the loop is iterating over `results` and not using `index` in the loop itself.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of the `results` list to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`results` must contain at least one element**
