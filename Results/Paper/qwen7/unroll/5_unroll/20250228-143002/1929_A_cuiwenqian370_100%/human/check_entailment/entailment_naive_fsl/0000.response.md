Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the `func_1` function calculates the beauty of the array as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements, but this approach does not guarantee the maximum possible beauty after rearranging the elements.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
The provided solution sorts the array and calculates the beauty as:
```
|54 - 100| + |80 - 54| + |43 - 80| + |90 - 43| = 46 + 26 + 37 + 47 = 156
```
However, the maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the elements to maximize the positive differences. One optimal arrangement could be `[43, 90, 100, 80, 54]`, which gives:
```
|90 - 43| + |100 - 90| + |80 - 100| + |54 - 80| = 47 + 10 + 20 + 26 = 103
```
Thus, the program does not always find the maximum possible beauty, making it incorrect.
