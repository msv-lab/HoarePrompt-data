### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not solve the problem as intended. The function `func_1` sorts the array and calculates the beauty of the sorted array, which is not guaranteed to be the maximum possible beauty. The original assessment is accurate in pointing out that the correct solution would involve finding the optimal arrangement of the array elements to maximize the sum of differences.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the problem statement, we can see that the code actually does not attempt to find the optimal arrangement. Instead, it simply calculates the beauty of the sorted array for each test case. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the original assessment is indeed correct.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as it only calculates the beauty of the sorted array, which is not guaranteed to be the maximum possible beauty. The correct solution would involve a more complex algorithm to find the optimal arrangement of the array elements.
