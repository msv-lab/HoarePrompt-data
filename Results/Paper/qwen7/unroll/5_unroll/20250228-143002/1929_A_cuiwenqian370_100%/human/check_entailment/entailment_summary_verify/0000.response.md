### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the maximum beauty of the array \(a\) where the beauty is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize the beauty, we need to strategically rearrange the elements of the array.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function sorts the array and then calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - While sorting helps in arranging the elements in a way that might increase some positive differences, it does not necessarily guarantee the maximum possible beauty. For instance, sorting might not always yield the optimal arrangement for maximizing the beauty.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function reads the input data and processes multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case to calculate the beauty.
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results.

#### Function Summary:
- The summary states that `func_2` processes multiple test cases, calculating the maximum beauty for each case based on an array of integers provided in the input data. It stores the results in a list and prints the result for each test case.

#### Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly points out that sorting the array does not always yield the maximum possible beauty. However, the key issue lies in the fact that the function `func_1` is being called with the sorted array, which might not always give the optimal result.
- The provided example in the original assessment shows that sorting the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]` results in a beauty of 156, whereas the optimal arrangement `[43, 90, 100, 80, 54]` yields a beauty of 103. This indicates that the current approach is not optimal.

Given the above analysis, the program does not always find the maximum possible beauty, even though the implementation seems to follow the logic of maximizing the beauty by sorting the array.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. The `func_1` function calculates the beauty of the array as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements, but this approach does not guarantee the maximum possible beauty after rearranging the elements. The provided example demonstrates that sorting the array does not always yield the optimal result.
