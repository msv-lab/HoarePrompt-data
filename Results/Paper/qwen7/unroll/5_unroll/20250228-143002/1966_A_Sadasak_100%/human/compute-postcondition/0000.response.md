Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, and k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `frequency_table`. This does not affect the values of `arr` or `k`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state of `arr` and `k`, while adding the new information that `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.
