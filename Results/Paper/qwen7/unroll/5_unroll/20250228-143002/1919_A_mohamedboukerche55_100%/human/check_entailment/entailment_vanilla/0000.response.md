Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` which contains two space-separated integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Parsing Input**:
   - The program splits the string `s` using `split()` and converts the first and second elements to integers `a` and `b`, respectively.

3. **Winning Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even.
   - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it prints 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

### Correctness Analysis

To determine if the program is correct, we need to understand the optimal strategy for the game and how the condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0` relates to the outcome.

#### Optimal Strategy
- Each player can either swap wallets or keep them.
- Removing one coin from the current wallet is always possible as long as the wallet is not empty.
- The key insight is that the parity (even or odd nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`) determines the winner:
  - If `a + b` is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position.
  - If `a + b` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.

#### Reasoning
- When `a + b` is even:
  - Bob can always ensure that after his move, the total number of coins remains even.
  - This means Alice will eventually be forced to make a move when the total is 0, making her lose.
- When `a + b` is odd:
  - Alice can always ensure that after her move, the total number of coins becomes even.
  - This means Bob will eventually be forced to make a move when the total is 0, making him lose.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the winning condition based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Conclusion
The program correctly determines the winner based on the given rules and logic. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
