Reasoning:
The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game rules as described in the problem statement. According to the rules, the players take turns removing one coin from their own wallet and can optionally swap wallets. However, the solution simply checks if the sum of the initial number of coins in both wallets is even or odd and prints 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on that. This approach does not account for the game's dynamic nature where players can choose to swap wallets or not, and the game continues until a player cannot make a valid move.

Given the problem's complexity, the solution should simulate the game's logic more accurately. The key observation is that if the total number of coins is even, Bob wins because he can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he is the last to make a move. Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice wins because she can force Bob into a losing position.

However, the provided solution does not simulate the game's turns and just checks the sum, which is why it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
