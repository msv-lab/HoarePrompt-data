Output State: The output state will consist of 'Bob' or 'Alice' printed for each iteration of the loop based on whether the sum of the first two integers in the input string `s` is even or odd. Specifically, if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, 'Bob' is printed; otherwise, 'Alice' is printed. The exact sequence of 'Bob' and 'Alice' will depend on the input provided during each iteration of the loop.
