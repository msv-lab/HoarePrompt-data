You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 8 : The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( m \), where \( 3 \leq n \leq m \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} \right\rfloor \) and \( m \leq 2 \times 10^5 \). For each test case, it reads \( m \) lines, each containing three integers \( u \), \( v \), and \( w \), representing an edge between vertices \( u \) and \( v \) with weight \( w \), where \( 1 \leq u, v \leq n \), \( u \neq v \), and \( 1 \leq w \leq 10^6 \). The function does not return any specific value but processes the input data according to the specified structure.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge. Specifically, the program uses a union-find data structure to find cycles but does not ensure that the cycle is simple (i.e., it does not visit the same vertex more than once).

Here's a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Consider a graph with 4 vertices and 4 edges:
- Edge 1: (1, 2, 2)
- Edge 2: (2, 3, 2)
- Edge 3: (3, 4, 2)
- Edge 4: (4, 1, 3)

The program will correctly identify that the minimum weight of the lightest edge is 2. However, it will incorrectly find a cycle involving all four vertices (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1), which is not a simple cycle because it revisits vertex 1.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the cycle found is simple. This can be achieved by maintaining a visited array or set to track the vertices visited during the DFS traversal and ensuring no vertex is revisited within the same cycle.
