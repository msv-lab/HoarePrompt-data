t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of integers n and m representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph respectively, where 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5). For each edge, there are three integers u, v, and w representing the vertices connected by the edge and its weight, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6.
