Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph where the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle is minimized.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads an integer from standard input.
   - `func_2()`: Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_3()`: Reads space-separated integers from standard input, converts them to integers, and returns a map object.
   - `func_4()`: Reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input, converts them to a list of integers, and returns this list.
   - `func_5()`: Reads input from standard input, splits each line by whitespace, and returns a list of these strings. The list contains the first line with two integers `n` and `m`, followed by lines each containing three integers `u`, `v`, and `w` representing edges in a graph.
   - `func_6()`: Processes the graph to find the minimum-weight cycle using a union-find data structure and depth-first search (DFS).
   - `dfs()`: A helper function for DFS traversal.
   - `func_7()`: Processes multiple test cases, calling `func_6()` for each test case.
3. **Execution Summary**:
   - `func_7()` correctly reads the number of test cases and calls `func_6()` for each test case.
   - `func_6()` constructs the graph and sorts the edges in descending order of weight. It then uses a union-find data structure to detect cycles and keeps track of the minimum edge weight in such cycles.
   - `dfs()` correctly performs a DFS to find the cycle involving the minimum edge weight.
4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The code reads the input correctly and processes it as required.
   - The union-find data structure is used effectively to detect cycles and keep track of the minimum edge weights.
   - The DFS function correctly identifies the cycle involving the minimum edge weight.
   - The output format matches the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to be correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
