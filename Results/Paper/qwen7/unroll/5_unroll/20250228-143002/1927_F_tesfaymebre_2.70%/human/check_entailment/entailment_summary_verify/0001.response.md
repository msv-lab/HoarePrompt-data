### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided program based on the problem description, the function summaries, and the original assessment.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` for each test case.
   - It reads the edges and stores them in a graph representation using an adjacency list.

2. **Sorting Edges:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order based on their weights. This is crucial for the next steps.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):**
   - A DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure is used to keep track of connected components.
   - For each edge, it checks if the two vertices belong to the same component. If they do, it merges them and updates the minimum edge weight in the component.
   - If they don't, it merges them without updating the minimum edge weight.

4. **Finding the Minimum Edge Cycle:**
   - After processing all edges, it identifies the component with the smallest minimum edge weight.
   - It then uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to find a cycle starting from the vertex with the smallest minimum edge weight.
   - The DFS ensures that the cycle is simple (no repeated vertices).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It also prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Key Points to Verify

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - The graph is correctly represented using an adjacency list.

2. **Edge Sorting:**
   - The edges are sorted in reverse order, which is necessary to ensure that the first cycle found is the one with the minimum lightest edge.

3. **DSU Operations:**
   - The DSU operations are correctly implemented to merge components and update the minimum edge weight.

4. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The DFS correctly finds a simple cycle starting from the vertex with the smallest minimum edge weight.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the required format, including the weight of the lightest edge, the number of vertices in the cycle, and the vertices themselves.

### Detailed Evaluation

- **Graph Representation:**
  - The graph is stored as a dictionary of lists, which is appropriate for an adjacency list representation.

- **Edge Sorting:**
  - The edges are sorted in reverse order, ensuring that the first cycle found will have the minimum lightest edge.

- **DSU Operations:**
  - The DSU operations are implemented correctly. The `union` method updates the minimum edge weight in the component, and the `find` method efficiently finds the root of a component.

- **Cycle Detection:**
  - The DFS correctly detects a simple cycle starting from the vertex with the smallest minimum edge weight. The `colors` array ensures that no vertex is visited more than once in the current path.

- **Output Format:**
  - The output format matches the required format, and the vertices are printed in the correct order.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. The logic is sound, and the implementation adheres to the problem requirements.

### Final Answer
