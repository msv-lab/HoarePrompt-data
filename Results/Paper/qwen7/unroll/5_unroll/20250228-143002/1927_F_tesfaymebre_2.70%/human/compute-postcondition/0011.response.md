Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `curr`, `parent`, and `path`. `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex in the DFS traversal, and `path` is a list representing the current path being explored. The function returns the list `path` if the current vertex `curr` has a color of 1 and is part of the path, otherwise it returns an empty list.**
