The function `dfs` accepts three parameters: `curr`, `parent`, and `path`. `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex in the DFS traversal, and `path` is a list representing the current path being explored.

- If the current vertex `curr` has a color of 1 and is part of the path, the function returns the list `path`.
- Otherwise, the function returns an empty list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `dfs` is to accept an integer `curr`, an integer `parent`, and a list `path`. It checks if the current vertex `curr` is colored 1 and is part of the path. If so, it returns the current path `path`. Otherwise, it returns an empty list.
