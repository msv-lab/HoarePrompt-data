n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, m is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph, and graph is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the graph where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of tuples containing adjacent vertices and their corresponding edge weights. Additionally, edges is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the weight of an edge and the two vertices it connects.
