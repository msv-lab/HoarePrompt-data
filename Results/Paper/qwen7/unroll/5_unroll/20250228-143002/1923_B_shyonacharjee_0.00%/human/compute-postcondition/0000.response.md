Output State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. Additionally, there are two lists of integers a and x, where both lists have length n, and the elements of x are unique, sorted in strictly increasing order, and satisfy -n ≤ x_i ≤ n with x_i ≠ 0 for all i.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The conditions for `t` remain the same, and the other variables and conditions (n, k, a, and x) are not affected by this line of code.
