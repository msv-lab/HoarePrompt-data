Output State: The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case, indicating whether it is possible to defeat all monsters with the given number of bullets (`k`). For each test case, the program sorts the monsters based on their absolute positions, then checks if the player can shoot them all within the available time and bullets. If the player can defeat all monsters, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
