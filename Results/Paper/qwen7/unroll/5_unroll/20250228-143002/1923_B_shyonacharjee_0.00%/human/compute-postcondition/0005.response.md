Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( k \), and two lists of integers \( \text{positions} \) and \( \text{healths} \). For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to defeat all monsters using the given number of bullets within the allowed time. If it is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function reads inputs from standard input and outputs results to standard output.**
