Reasoning:
The provided program aims to find the minimum number of new problems needed to ensure that for every existing problem `a_i`, its difficulty is less than or equal to the expected difficulty `b_i`. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, and the arrays `a` and `b` which represent the current difficulties and the expected difficulties, respectively.
3. It initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of new problems added.
4. It uses two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse through the arrays `a` and `b`.
5. If the current expected difficulty `b[j]` is less than the current actual difficulty `a[i]`, it means a new problem with difficulty `b[j]` needs to be added. This is done by removing the last element from `a` and inserting `b[j]` in the correct position to maintain the non-decreasing order.
6. The pointer `j` is incremented to move to the next expected difficulty.
7. If the current actual difficulty `a[i]` is not greater than the current expected difficulty `b[j]`, both pointers are incremented to move to the next pair of difficulties.
8. After processing all elements, the counter `cnt` gives the minimum number of new problems required.

The provided code correctly implements the logic described above. It ensures that the array `a` remains sorted and the number of new problems added is minimized. The `func_1` function provided seems to be irrelevant to the main logic of the program and does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Therefore, the given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
