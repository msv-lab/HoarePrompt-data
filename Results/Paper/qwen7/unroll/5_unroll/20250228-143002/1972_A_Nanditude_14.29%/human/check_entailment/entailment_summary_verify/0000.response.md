### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the minimum number of new problems to propose such that for every problem \(i\), the difficulty \(a_i\) is less than or equal to the expected difficulty \(b_i\). Each time a new problem with difficulty \(w\) is proposed, the most difficult problem in the contest is removed, and the remaining problems are re-sorted.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\), and for each test case, it reads the lengths of arrays \(a\) and \(b\), and then their respective elements.
2. **Main Logic**:
   - Two pointers `i` and `j` are used to traverse arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - If \(b[j] < a[i]\), it means the current problem in `b` is too difficult compared to the current problem in `a`. Therefore, a new problem with difficulty \(b[j]\) is proposed, the last element in `a` is removed, and the array is re-sorted.
   - Both pointers `i` and `j` are incremented.
   - This process continues until either all elements in `a` are processed or all elements in `b` are processed.
3. **Counting Proposals**: The variable `cnt` keeps track of the number of new problems proposed.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function `func_1` is not relevant to the main logic of the program. It simply sorts the input list in descending order, which is not used in the main program logic.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program logic correctly identifies when a new problem needs to be proposed by comparing elements in `a` and `b`.
- The array `a` is re-sorted after each insertion, ensuring that the array remains sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The program correctly increments the proposal count and updates the array `a` accordingly.
- The program handles the termination condition properly, stopping when all elements in `b` have been processed.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The original assessment was incorrect because the program does handle the logic correctly and produces the right result for the given examples.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the given examples.
