You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

    6
    
    4 5 6 7 8 9
    
    1 2 3 4 5 6

Output

    3
    
Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of two lists, where the first list contains n non-decreasing integers representing the difficulties of the existing problems (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), and the second list contains n non-decreasing integers representing the expected difficulties (b_1, b_2, ..., b_n), with 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a list of two lists, where the first list contains n non-decreasing integers representing the difficulties of the existing problems, and the second list contains n non-decreasing integers representing the expected difficulties, but both lists are sorted in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of two lists containing non-decreasing integers representing difficulties and expected difficulties. After sorting both lists in descending order, it returns a new list of two lists with the same structure but with the integers sorted in descending order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the array `a` of current difficulties, and the array `b` of expected difficulties.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of new problems added.
   - It uses two pointers `i` and `j` to iterate through arrays `a` and `b`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program enters a while loop that continues until either `i` or `j` reaches the end of their respective arrays.
   - Inside the loop:
     - If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, it means the current difficulty of the problem (`a[i]`) is greater than the expected difficulty (`b[j]`).
     - To fix this, the program removes the last element of `a` (which is `a[i]`), inserts `b[j]` at the correct position in `a` to maintain the sorted order, and increments the counter `cnt` by 1.
     - Both `i` and `j` are incremented to move to the next elements in both arrays.
     - If `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]`, both `i` and `j` are incremented to move to the next elements in both arrays.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the program prints the value of `cnt`, which represents the minimum number of new problems needed.

### Verification Against Examples

#### Example 1:
- Input:
  ```
  2
  6
  1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
  800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
  6
  4 5 6 7 8 9
  1 2 3 4 5 6
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  3
  ```

- **Explanation**:
  - For the first test case:
    - Initial `a`: `[1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200, 2700]`
    - Initial `b`: `[800, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2200, 3000]`
    - After proposing a problem with difficulty `800`: `[800, 1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200]`
    - After proposing a problem with difficulty `1800`: `[800, 1000, 1400, 1800, 2000, 2000]`
    - Total new problems: 2

  - For the second test case:
    - Initial `a`: `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
    - Initial `b`: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
    - After proposing a problem with difficulty `1`: `[1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
    - After proposing a problem with difficulty `2`: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
    - After proposing a problem with difficulty `3`: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
    - Total new problems: 3

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of new problems needed to ensure that `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i`. The code handles the insertion and removal of elements appropriately and maintains the sorted order.
