### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Let's break down the issues and verify why the original assessment is correct.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program attempts to check if the split digits of the previous element, plus the current element, are sorted. However, it does not actually perform the split and reinsert the digits back into the array. Instead, it just sets the previous element to the first digit of the split result, which may not necessarily lead to a sorted array.
2. **Misunderstanding of the Problem**: The program does not correctly simulate the process of splitting and reinserting digits to achieve a sorted array. It only checks the condition without actually modifying the array to reflect the split operation.

#### Verification:
To verify the correctness, let's analyze the provided example and another example to see if the program behaves as expected.

**Example 1:**
```
4
12 3 45 67
```
- The program checks if `3 < 45`. It splits `45` to `[4, 5]` and checks if `[4, 5, 67]` is sorted. Since it is not, it sets `45` to `4`, resulting in `[12, 3, 4, 67]`, which is still not sorted. Therefore, the program incorrectly prints `NO`.

**Example 2:**
```
3
12 28 5
```
- The program checks if `28 < 5`. Since `28 > 5`, it does not need to perform any operation and directly prints `NO`. This is correct because the array cannot be sorted by the given operations.

**Example 3:**
```
2
0 0
```
- The program checks if `0 < 0`, which is false, so it prints `YES`. This is correct because the array is already sorted.

From these examples, it is clear that the program does not correctly simulate the splitting and reinsertion of digits to achieve a sorted array. It only checks the condition without actually modifying the array, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the transformation of the array to achieve a sorted state by splitting and reinserting digits.

**Final: False**
