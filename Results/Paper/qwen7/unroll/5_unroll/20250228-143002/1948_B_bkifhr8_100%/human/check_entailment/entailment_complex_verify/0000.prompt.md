You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, each iteration of the loop processes input values for `m` and `arr`, and after all iterations, the final value of `ans` is printed as either 'NO' or 'YES'. The final state of `t` and `n` remains unchanged from their initial values, while `m` and `arr` are updated based on the input during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) (where \( 2 \leq n \leq 50 \)) followed by \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) (each between 0 and 99). For each test case, it checks if the sequence can be made non-decreasing by swapping adjacent elements at most once. If such a swap is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array needs to be transformed into a sorted array by splitting elements that are at least 10. Specifically, the program checks if the current element is less than the previous element and attempts to split the previous element to see if it can be made non-decreasing. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. It only checks if the split digits of the previous element, plus the current element, are sorted, but it does not actually perform the split and reinsert the digits back into the array. Instead, it just sets the previous element to the first digit of the split result, which may not necessarily lead to a sorted array.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
12 3 45 67
```
The program would check:
- `3 < 45` and attempt to split `45` to `[4, 5]`, but it doesn't reinsert these digits back into the array. It just sets `45` to `4`, which results in the array `[12, 3, 4, 67]`, which is still not sorted.

A correct approach would involve actually performing the split and reinsertion of digits back into the array to ensure the array becomes sorted.
