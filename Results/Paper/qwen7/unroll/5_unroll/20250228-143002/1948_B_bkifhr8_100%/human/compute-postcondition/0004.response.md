Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through multiple lines. It first reads an integer `n` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, then reads `n` integers each between 0 and 99. The function returns a value based on the processed input.**

This means the function indirectly accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, processes them according to their constraints, and returns a result based on the input data.
