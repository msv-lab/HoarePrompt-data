Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the required subsets \( l \) and \( r \) such that the bitwise XOR of elements in \( l \) equals the bitwise XOR of elements in \( r \). Here is an example to demonstrate this:

Consider the following input:
```
2
2 1
1 2 2 1
6 1
6 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 4
```

For the first test case:
- The array is \([1, 2, 2, 1]\).
- We need to find two subsets \( l \) and \( r \) each of length 2 such that their bitwise XOR is the same.

The program outputs:
```
2 1
2 1
```

This is correct because \( 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1 = 3 \).

However, for the second test case:
- The array is \([6, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 6, 3, 5, 5, 4]\).
- We need to find two subsets \( l \) and \( r \) each of length 2 such that their bitwise XOR is the same.

The program outputs:
```
6 4
1 2
```

But the correct output should be something like:
```
6 4
1 3
```

Because \( 6 \oplus 4 = 2 \) and \( 1 \oplus 3 = 2 \), which satisfies the condition.

The program fails to correctly generate the subsets in some cases, hence it is incorrect.
