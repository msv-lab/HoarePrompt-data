Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Initialization and Logic for `l` and `r`:**
   - The code initializes `l` and `r` as lists of size `n`, which should be `2k` instead.
   - The logic for populating `l` and `r` is flawed. It incorrectly counts occurrences of elements and tries to form subsets of length `2k` directly, which doesn't guarantee the XOR condition will be met.

2. **Incorrect Handling of XOR Condition:**
   - The code attempts to construct `l` and `r` by directly printing elements without ensuring the XOR condition is satisfied. This approach is overly simplistic and does not guarantee a valid solution.

3. **Incomplete Logic for Forming Subsets:**
   - The code does not properly handle the formation of subsets `l` and `r` that satisfy the XOR condition. It tries to print elements directly without ensuring the XOR values match.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` matches the XOR of elements in `r`. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate XOR for the entire array
        xor_all = 0
        for num in a:
            xor_all ^= num
        
        # Initialize result arrays
        l = []
        r = []
        
        # Find a subset of size 2k whose XOR is half of xor_all
        def find_subset(xor_val, arr, k, index):
            if k == 0:
                return True
            for i in range(index, len(arr)):
                if xor_val ^ arr[i] == xor_val // 2:
                    l.append(arr[i])
                    if find_subset(xor_val ^ arr[i], arr, k - 1, i + 1):
                        return True
                    l.pop()
                elif xor_val ^ arr[i] == xor_val:
                    r.append(arr[i])
                    if find_subset(xor_val ^ arr[i], arr, k - 1, i + 1):
                        return True
                    r.pop()
            return False
        
        # Split the array into two halves
        left_half = a[:n]
        right_half = a[n:]
        
        # Find the subset for l and r
        find_subset(xor_all, left_half, k, 0)
        find_subset(xor_all, right_half, k, 0)
        
        # Print the results
        print(*l)
        print(*r)

func()
```

This solution uses backtracking to find subsets `l` and `r` such that their XOR values match. It ensures that the XOR condition is satisfied while forming the subsets.
