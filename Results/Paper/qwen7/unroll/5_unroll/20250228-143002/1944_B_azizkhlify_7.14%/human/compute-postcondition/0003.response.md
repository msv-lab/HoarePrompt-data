Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a test case defined by three components: a positive integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), an array a of length 2n (where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice), and two integers n and k (such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋). For each test case, the function determines and returns a specific value based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the array `a`. The function's output depends on the relationship between `n`, `k`, and the structure of the array `a`.
