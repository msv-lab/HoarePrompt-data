The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \), an array \( a \) of length \( 2n \) where each integer from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly twice, and two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it prints pairs of numbers from the array \( a \) where the number appears exactly twice, up to \( k \) such pairs. If there are not enough such pairs, it then prints additional single occurrences of numbers from the array \( a \) until \( k \) is satisfied. After that, it prints the remaining numbers from the array \( a \) that were part of the `res` list. If at any point the counts of left (`ul`) and right (`ur`) occurrences match, the loop breaks early. The function outputs a series of these printed lines for each test case.
