Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' responses based on the conditions checked within the loop for each iteration. For each test case (`i` in `range(tests)`), the program checks if character `c` is in strings `a` or `b`. If `c` is found in either `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if each character in `c` is present in the corresponding part of `a` and `b`. If any character in `c` is not found in both `a` and `b`, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The output state will be a list of 'YES' and 'NO' for each test case.
