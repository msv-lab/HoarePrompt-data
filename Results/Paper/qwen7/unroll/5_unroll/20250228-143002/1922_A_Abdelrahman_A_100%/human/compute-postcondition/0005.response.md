Functionality: The function processes multiple test cases, each involving three strings \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are composed of exactly \(n\) lowercase Latin letters and \(c\) is also composed of \(n\) lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, the function checks if \(c\) contains any character not present in either \(a\) or \(b\). If \(c\) contains a character not in \(a\) or \(b\), it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if every character in \(c\) is present in the corresponding positions in both \(a\) and \(b\). If any character in \(c\) is missing from both \(a\) and \(b\), it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function outputs a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' for each test case.
