Output State: **`tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.**

The code `tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tests`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), and `tests` is now holding the value of this integer, the output state reflects that `tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
