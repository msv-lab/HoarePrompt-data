Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template that matches both `a` and `b` but not `c`. Specifically, the program checks if `c` is exactly equal to `a` or `b`, and if not, it assumes a template exists without further validation. This approach is flawed because it does not ensure that the conditions for matching the template are met for all positions.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
2
aa
bb
ab
```

- The program will output "YES" because `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`.
- However, there is no template that would make `a` and `b` match while making `c` not match. Any template that makes `a` and `b` match would also allow `c` to match if `c` has the same characters in the same positions as `a` or `b`.

Thus, the program fails to correctly handle this case, making it incorrect.
