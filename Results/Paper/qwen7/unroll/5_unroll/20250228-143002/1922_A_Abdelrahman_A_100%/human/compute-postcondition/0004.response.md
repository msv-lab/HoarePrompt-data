Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, n, a, b, and c, where t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer between 1 and 20, and a, b, and c are strings of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a value based on these inputs.**
