Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. The function `func_1` correctly separates the digits and letters from the password.
3. It checks if the digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.
4. The logic for checking the conditions is sound:
   - It ensures that no digit comes after a letter.
   - It sorts and checks the digits and letters separately.
5. The output is generated correctly based on the validation results.

Given the above points, the provided code accurately implements the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
