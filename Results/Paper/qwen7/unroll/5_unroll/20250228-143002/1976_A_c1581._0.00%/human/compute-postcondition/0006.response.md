Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains two objects: `i` and `char`.
   - `i` is an integer representing the index of the current character in the `password` string.
   - `char` is a string representing the character at the current index in the `password` string.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will start with `i` being 0 and `char` being the first character of the `password` string.
   - Since the `password` string consists of exactly `n` characters (where 1 <= n <= 20), the loop will iterate over each character in the string.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
   - `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string.
   - `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password` string.
   - `last_digit_index` is -1, which means no digit has been processed yet.

Given these points, the initial state before the loop starts should be such that:
- `i` is 0 (the starting index).
- `char` is the first character of the `password` string.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` is 0.
- `char` is the first character of the `password` string.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `char` is the first character of the `password` string**.
