The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `password`. `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 <= n <= 20`, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit. The function has three possible return values: 'NO', 'NO', and 'YES'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a password string and return 'YES' under certain conditions, and 'NO' in other cases, but since both 'NO' cases are identical, it effectively returns 'NO' in those scenarios and 'YES' in the specified condition.
