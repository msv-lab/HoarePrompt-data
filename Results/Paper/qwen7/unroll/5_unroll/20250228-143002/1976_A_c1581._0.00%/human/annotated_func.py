#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a password string and checks if it meets specific criteria. It first separates the password into digits and letters, then checks if the digits and letters are in sorted order. If any of these conditions are not met, it returns 'NO'. If all conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.
