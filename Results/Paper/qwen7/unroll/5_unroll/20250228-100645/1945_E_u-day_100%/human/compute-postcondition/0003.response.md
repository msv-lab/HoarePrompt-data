State: **`pos` is -1, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of calling `func_2()`, `i` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `i` is defined in the loop head as part of the `range(n)` function. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to 0 before the loop starts to align with the `range(n)` function's behavior, where `i` starts from 0 and increments up to `n-1`.

2. The other variables (`pos`, `n`, `k`, and `arr`) are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute. They are not modified within the loop body (as indicated by "the loop body is omit"), so their current states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

3. Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, ensuring `i` is 0 is sufficient to allow the loop to begin its first iteration.

Thus, the only state that needs adjustment is setting `i` to 0.
