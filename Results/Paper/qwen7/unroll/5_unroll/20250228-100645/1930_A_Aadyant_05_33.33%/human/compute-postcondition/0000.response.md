Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` is an input integer, and n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.**

Explanation: The code `num = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `num`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `n` is also not defined within the given code snippet, so it is assumed to be an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
