### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. This needs to be done `n` times for each test case.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`num`), but does not use this value.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `a`, which should be `2n`.
   - It then reads a string `b` containing space-separated integers, splits it into a list `list1`, and sorts it.
   - It creates another list `list2` where it appends every second element from the sorted list `list1`. This is intended to pick the smallest elements from the list.
   - It calculates the sum of the elements in `list2` and appends this sum to the list `out`.
   - Finally, it prints each element of `out`.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The code does not correctly handle the input format. Specifically, it expects the number of test cases and the number of integers per test case, but it only reads the number of integers per test case.
   - The logic to pick the smallest elements from the sorted list is flawed. Instead of picking every second element, it should pick the smallest elements in each iteration.
   - The code does not ensure that the pairs are chosen optimally to maximize the score.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Sort the list of integers.
   - Pair the smallest element with the next smallest element, the third smallest with the fourth smallest, and so on.
   - Sum the minimum values of these pairs to get the maximum score.

### Conclusion:

The given code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy to maximize the score. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
