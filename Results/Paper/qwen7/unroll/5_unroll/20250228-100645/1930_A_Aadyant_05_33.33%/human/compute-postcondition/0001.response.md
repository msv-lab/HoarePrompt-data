Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `out` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `out`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `num`, or `n`. Therefore, their values remain as per the initial state.
