Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `out` is a list containing `num` elements. Each element in the list is the sum of every second element from a sorted list of space-separated integers, where the length of the list is specified by user input `a`.
