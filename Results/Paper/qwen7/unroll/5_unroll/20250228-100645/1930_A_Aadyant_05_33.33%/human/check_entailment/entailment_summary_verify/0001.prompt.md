You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    num = input()
    out = []
    for numbers in range(int(num)):
        list2 = []
        list1 = []
        a = input()
        a = int(a)
        b = input('')
        list1 = b.split()
        list1.sort()
        for i in range(a):
            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        out.append(sum(list2))
        del list1[:]
        del list2[:]
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t and an integer n, along with 2n integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of every second element from the input list, sorts these sums, and then prints each sum. The final output is a series of printed sums corresponding to each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. This needs to be done `n` times for each test case.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`num`), but does not use this value.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `a`, which should be `2n`.
   - It then reads a string `b` containing space-separated integers, splits it into a list `list1`, and sorts it.
   - It creates another list `list2` where it appends every second element from the sorted list `list1`. This is intended to pick the smallest elements from the list.
   - It calculates the sum of the elements in `list2` and appends this sum to the list `out`.
   - Finally, it prints each element of `out`.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The code does not correctly handle the input format. Specifically, it expects the number of test cases and the number of integers per test case, but it only reads the number of integers per test case.
   - The logic to pick the smallest elements from the sorted list is flawed. Instead of picking every second element, it should pick the smallest elements in each iteration.
   - The code does not ensure that the pairs are chosen optimally to maximize the score.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Sort the list of integers.
   - Pair the smallest element with the next smallest element, the third smallest with the fourth smallest, and so on.
   - Sum the minimum values of these pairs to get the maximum score.

### Conclusion:

The given code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy to maximize the score. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
