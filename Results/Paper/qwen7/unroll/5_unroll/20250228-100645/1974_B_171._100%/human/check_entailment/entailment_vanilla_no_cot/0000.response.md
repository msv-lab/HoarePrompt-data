Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates through the split data to process each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it extracts the necessary information (length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself) and calls the `func_1` function to decode the string.

3. **Decoding Logic in `func_1`**:
   - **Unique Characters**: It first finds all unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - **Mapping Characters**: It creates a mapping where each character in the sorted unique set is mapped to its corresponding character from the end of the sorted unique set.
   - **Decoding**: It uses this mapping to decode the entire encoded string by replacing each character according to the mapping.

4. **Output**: The decoded strings are collected and printed one by one.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program works as expected and produces the correct output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
