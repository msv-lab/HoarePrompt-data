Reasoning:
1. The program reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it correctly extracts the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.
3. The `func_1` function is responsible for decoding the string:
   - It first finds all unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - It creates a dictionary (`char_map`) where each character is mapped to its corresponding character from the end of the sorted unique characters list.
   - It then decodes the encoded string by replacing each character according to the `char_map`.
4. The program correctly appends the decoded strings to the `results` list and prints each decoded string.

Given the provided execution summary and the explanation of the program's logic, the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
