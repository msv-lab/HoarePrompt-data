Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle. For three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of any two must be greater than the third.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It defines a function `func_1` which processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of exponents `a_i`.
   - It uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count occurrences of each exponent.
   - It calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length (`cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`).
   - It also calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of one length and 1 stick of another length (`cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`), where `total_count` keeps track of the total number of sticks processed so far.
   - Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for counting ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length is correct.
   - The logic for counting ways to choose 2 sticks of one length and 1 stick of another length is also correct, as it ensures the triangle inequality condition is met.
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by storing intermediate results and printing them at the end.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where there are fewer than 3 sticks (result will be 0).
   - It correctly handles cases where the same length appears multiple times and calculates combinations accordingly.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
