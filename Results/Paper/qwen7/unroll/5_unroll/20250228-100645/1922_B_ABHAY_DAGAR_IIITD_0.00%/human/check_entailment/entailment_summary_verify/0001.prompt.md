You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
func_1(t)

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n = int(input())
        num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
        num_of_lens = {}
        for x in num_list:
            if x in num_of_lens:
                num_of_lens[x] += 1
            else:
                num_of_lens[x] = 1
        res = 0
        total_count = 0
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
            if cnt >= 2:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
            total_count += cnt
        results.append(res)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing exponents used to determine stick lengths. For each test case, it calculates the number of unique triplets and pairs of sticks that can be formed, and sums these values. The function then returns a list of integers, where each integer corresponds to the calculated result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle. For three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of any two must be greater than the third.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It defines a function `func_1` which processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of exponents `a_i`.
   - It uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count occurrences of each exponent.
   - It calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length (`cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`).
   - It also calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of one length and 1 stick of another length (`cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`), where `total_count` keeps track of the total number of sticks processed so far.
   - Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for counting ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length is correct.
   - The logic for counting ways to choose 2 sticks of one length and 1 stick of another length is also correct, as it ensures the triangle inequality condition is met.
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by storing intermediate results and printing them at the end.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where there are fewer than 3 sticks (result will be 0).
   - It correctly handles cases where the same length appears multiple times and calculates combinations accordingly.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
