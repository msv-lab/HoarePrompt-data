Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle.
- The annotated program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- It uses a dictionary (`num_of_lens`) to count occurrences of each exponent value.
- For each exponent value that appears at least three times, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks with that exponent.
- For each exponent value that appears at least twice, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks with that exponent and multiplies by the total count of sticks with other exponents (to ensure the third side condition).
- The logic for counting valid triangles is correct.
- The final results are printed correctly.

Given the analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
