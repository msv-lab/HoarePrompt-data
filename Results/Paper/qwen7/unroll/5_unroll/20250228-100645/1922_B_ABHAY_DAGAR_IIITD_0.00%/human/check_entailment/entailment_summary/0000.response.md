Reasoning:
1. The provided program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of ways to choose 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle.
2. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
3. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks (`n`) and their corresponding exponents (`a_i`).
4. It uses a dictionary (`num_of_lens`) to count occurrences of each exponent.
5. The program then calculates the number of valid triplets and pairs of sticks:
   - Triplets: If there are at least 3 sticks with the same exponent, it calculates combinations of these sticks.
   - Pairs: If there are at least 2 sticks with the same exponent, it calculates combinations of these sticks with the remaining sticks.
6. The final result for each test case is stored in a list (`results`), which is printed at the end.

Given the above analysis, the program logic appears to be correct for calculating the number of ways to choose 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The program follows the steps required to solve the problem accurately.

Correctness: **True**
