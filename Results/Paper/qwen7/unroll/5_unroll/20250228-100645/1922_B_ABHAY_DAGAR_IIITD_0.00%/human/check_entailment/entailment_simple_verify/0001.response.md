### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle. For three lengths to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of any two must be greater than the third.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It defines a function `func_1` which processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of exponents `a_i`.
   - It uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count occurrences of each exponent.
   - It calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length (`cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`).
   - However, the logic for counting ways to choose 2 sticks of one length and 1 stick of another length (`cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`) is flawed. This logic assumes that any combination of 2 sticks of one length and 1 stick of another length will form a triangle, which is not true. The triangle inequality must still hold.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for counting ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length is correct.
   - The logic for counting ways to choose 2 sticks of one length and 1 stick of another length is incorrect. For example, if we have sticks of lengths \(2^3\), \(2^3\), and \(2^3\), the program would incorrectly count this as forming a triangle with any other stick of length \(2^3\), which is not true because \(2^3 + 2^3 \not> 2^3\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where there are fewer than 3 sticks (result will be 0).
   - It correctly handles cases where the same length appears multiple times and calculates combinations accordingly.
   - However, the program fails to ensure the triangle inequality condition for the combinations of different lengths.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem because it incorrectly counts some combinations as forming triangles when they do not satisfy the triangle inequality.

### Final Evaluation:
