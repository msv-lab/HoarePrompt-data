### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine its correctness.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Handling Single-Digit Elements**: The program should only process elements that are greater than or equal to 10. Elements less than 10 should be ignored.
2. **Processing Digits**: For elements greater than 10, the program should extract the last digit and the remaining part, then append these parts to the list `c` based on certain conditions.
3. **Sorting Check**: After processing all elements, the program should check if the list `c` is sorted. If it is, it appends 1 to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0.

#### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the number of elements `k` and the list `a` from the input.
   - It processes each element in `a`:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and not the first element, it splits the element into its last digit (`x`) and the remaining part (`y`).
     - It then checks if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in the list `c`. If so, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` in that order. Otherwise, it appends the entire number `a[i]`.
     - If the element is the first element and greater than 10, it follows similar logic.
     - If the element is less than 10, it is ignored.
   - Finally, it sorts the list `c` and checks if it is sorted. Based on the result, it appends 1 or 0 to the list `b`.

2. **Main Program**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints "YES" if the corresponding entry in `b` is 1, and "NO" otherwise.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Single-Digit Elements Handling**: The program correctly ignores elements less than 10 by not processing them further. This is handled within the loop where elements are processed.
- **Digit Extraction and Sorting**: The logic for extracting digits and checking if the resulting list `c` is sorted is implemented correctly.
- **Test Case Example**:
  - Consider the input:
    ```
    3
    2
    9 10
    ```
  - The program correctly identifies that the element 9 cannot be split and thus leaves it as is. The list `c` remains `[9, 10]`, which is not sorted. Hence, the program correctly outputs "NO".

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operation. The original assessment was inaccurate because it incorrectly identified the program as incorrect due to handling of single-digit elements, which is actually handled correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
