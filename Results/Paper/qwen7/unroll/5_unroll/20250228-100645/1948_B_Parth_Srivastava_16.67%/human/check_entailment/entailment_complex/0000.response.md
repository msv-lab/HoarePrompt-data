Reasoning:
1. The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by processing each test case and determining if the resulting list `c` is sorted after applying the specified operations.
2. The main issues with the program are:
   - The function `func_1()` is called without parameters, but it requires `t` (the number of test cases) and `n` (the length of the array) as inputs.
   - The program reads `m` test cases but only calls `func_1()` once, which means it does not process all test cases.
   - The logic for processing the array elements and checking if the final list `c` is sorted is correct.
3. However, the program does not correctly handle the input reading and processing for multiple test cases. It should read and process each test case separately.

Given the above reasoning, the program is not correct because it does not properly handle multiple test cases. Therefore, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
