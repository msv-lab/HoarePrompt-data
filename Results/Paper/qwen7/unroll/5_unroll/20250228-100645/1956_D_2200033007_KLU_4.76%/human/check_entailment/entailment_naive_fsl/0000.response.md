Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality. The program reads the input but does not perform any operations to maximize the sum of the array elements as described. Instead, it directly prints a fixed output based on the length of the array, which is incorrect. For example, if the input is `3` followed by `1 3 9`, the expected output would be `13 0`, but the program incorrectly outputs `13 0` regardless of the input values. This shows that the program does not handle the actual problem logic and thus does not meet the requirements for any input other than the hardcoded cases.
