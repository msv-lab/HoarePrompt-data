Let's reason through the given program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates (x, y).

2. **Data Structure**:
   - The coordinates are stored in a list of lists `a`, where each sublist represents a point (x, y).

3. **Extracting X-coordinates**:
   - A new list `x` is created containing only the x-coordinates from the points.

4. **Calculating Side Length**:
   - The side length of the square is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`).
   - Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be derived solely from the x-coordinates.

5. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area of the square is simply the side length squared (`dx * dx`), which is printed.

### Verification:
- Given the constraints and the problem statement, the approach is correct. The side length of the square can indeed be determined by the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, but since the square is aligned with the axes, both will yield the same result).
- The program handles multiple test cases correctly by iterating over them using a loop.
- The input format and constraints are respected, ensuring that the coordinates form a valid square.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the side length of the square and calculates its area accurately.

**Correctness: True**
