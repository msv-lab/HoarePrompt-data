Reasoning:
The provided function correctly processes the input as specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the function's behavior:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This matches the problem statement where `t` indicates the number of test cases.

2. **Reading Coordinates**: For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates (x, y) into a list `a`. This ensures that all necessary coordinates are captured.

3. **Calculating Side Length**: The function extracts the x-coordinates from the list `a` and calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-values (`dx`). Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, this difference represents the side length of the square.

4. **Output**: The area of the square is calculated as `dx * dx` and printed for each test case. This is the correct formula for calculating the area of a square given its side length.

5. **Guaranteed Conditions**: The problem guarantees that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, so the function does not need to handle invalid cases.

Given that the function correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and adheres to the constraints and guarantees provided in the problem description, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
