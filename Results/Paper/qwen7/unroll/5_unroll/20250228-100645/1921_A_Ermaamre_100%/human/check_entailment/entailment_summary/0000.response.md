Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates.
3. It extracts the x-coordinates and computes the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`), which gives the side length of the square.
4. The area of the square is then calculated as `dx * dx` and printed.

Given that the problem guarantees that the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, the program will always correctly compute the side length as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, since the square is aligned with the axes).

Since the program follows the correct logic and the problem constraints ensure the validity of the input, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
