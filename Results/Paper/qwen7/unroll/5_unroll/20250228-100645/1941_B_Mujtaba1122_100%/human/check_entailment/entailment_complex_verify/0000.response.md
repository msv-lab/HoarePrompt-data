### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to understand its behavior and correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
- If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`.
- If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operations.
- It iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2.
- For each index `i` where `list[i] > 1` and `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`, it performs the following operations:
  - Decrease `list[i]` by `2 * list[i-1]`.
  - Decrease `list[i+1]` by `list[i-1]`.
  - Decrease `list[i-1]` by `list[i-1]` (effectively halving it).
- If at any point `list[i-1]` becomes zero during these operations, the function prints `NO` and returns immediately.
- After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero.
- If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints `YES`; otherwise, it prints `NO`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Correctness of Operations**:
   - The operations defined in the problem description are correctly implemented in the loop.
   - The loop ensures that the operations are applied only when the conditions are met (`list[i] > 1` and `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`).

2. **Handling Zero Elements**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where an element becomes zero during the operations. When `list[i-1]` becomes zero, the function prints `NO` and returns immediately, preventing further invalid operations.

3. **Final Check with `func_1`**:
   - After the loop, `func_1` is called to check if all elements are zero. This ensures that the final state of the array is verified correctly.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. The original assessment incorrectly identified a flaw in the program, but upon closer inspection, the program handles the operations and checks correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and accurately implements the logic to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations.
