Postcondition: **The list `list` has been modified according to the operations inside the loop. For each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0, the value of `list[i]` is decreased by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, the value of `list[i+1]` is decreased by the value of `list[i-1]`, and the value of `list[i-1]` is decreased by itself (effectively halved). If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero during the execution of the loop, the program prints 'no' and returns immediately, meaning the loop does not complete all iterations. If the loop completes without printing 'no', the final state of the list `list` will be the result of all the operations performed within the loop. The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`.**
