State: **`list` is a list of integers representing the array `a`, and `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `i` must be in the range [1, n-2]**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head defines the variable `i` and the range of its values as `range(1, n - 1)`.
2. For the loop to execute, `i` must take on values starting from 1 up to but not including `n - 1`.
3. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` must be within the range `[1, n-2]`.

Given the initial state where `list` is a list of integers representing the array `a` and `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, the only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `i`, which must be in the range `[1, n-2]`.

Note that the state of `list` and `n` do not change based on the loop condition; they remain as given.
