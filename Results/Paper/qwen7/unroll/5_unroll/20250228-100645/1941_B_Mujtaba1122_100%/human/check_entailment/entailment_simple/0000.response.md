### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds a non-zero element.
   - If the loop completes without finding any non-zero elements, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - `func_2` attempts to reduce the array to all zeros by repeatedly applying the specified operations.
   - For each index `i` from 1 to `n-2`, it checks if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the operations:
     - `list[i+1] -= list[i-1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i-1] -= list[i-1]`
   - If at any point `list[i-1]` becomes zero before the loop completes, it prints 'no' and returns immediately.
   - If the loop completes without printing 'no', it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are now zero.
   - Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'.

3. **Overall Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   - It then calls `func_2` to process the array.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the problem's requirements and checks if the array can be reduced to all zeros.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.

### Correctness:
**True**
