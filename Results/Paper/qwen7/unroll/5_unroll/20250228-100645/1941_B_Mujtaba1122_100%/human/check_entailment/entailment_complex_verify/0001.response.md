### Reasoning

The original assessment accurately describes the behavior and logic of the provided program. Let's break down the analysis again to ensure completeness and correctness:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an element that is not zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operations.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2 (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if the current element `list[i]` is greater than 1, and if the previous and next elements are also greater than 0.
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the operation:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - After performing the operation, it checks if the previous element (`list[i - 1]`) is still not zero. If it is not zero, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Operation Validity**:
   - The operation defined in the problem is valid and can reduce the values of the array as required.

2. **Function `func_2` Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2` ensures that the operation is applied only when the conditions are met, which is necessary to avoid invalid states.
   - If at any point the operation cannot be performed (i.e., the previous element becomes zero), it correctly identifies that the array cannot be reduced to all zeros and prints 'NO'.
   - If the array can be reduced to all zeros, it correctly identifies this and prints 'YES'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the array might already be in a state where no further operations can be performed.
   - It correctly identifies arrays that cannot be reduced to all zeros.

### Detailed Validation Using Annotated Code

- **Initial Input Handling**: 
  - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
  - The array is then passed to `func_2`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The loop iterates from index 1 to n-2.
  - For each index `i`, it checks if the current element `list[i]` is greater than 1 and if both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
  - If the conditions are met, it performs the specified operations.
  - If at any point `list[i-1]` becomes zero, it prints 'NO' and returns.
  - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero.
  - Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'.

### Conclusion

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program logic is sound and handles all necessary conditions and edge cases. The program accurately determines whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**
