Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution attempts to solve the problem but contains several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `nums` Array:**
   - The first element of the array `nums` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits, but this approach does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Sum `k`:**
   - After setting the first element, the remaining sum `k` is subtracted from it, but the subsequent elements are not correctly adjusted to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

3. **Lack of Proper Bitwise OR Consideration:**
   - The solution does not ensure that the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized. Instead, it simply tries to distribute the remaining sum among the elements.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to ensure that the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized while also ensuring that the sum of the sequence equals `k`. Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    # Initialize the result list
    result = [0] * n
    # Distribute the sum k among the elements to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR
    for i in range(n):
        if k > 0:
            result[i] = 1
            k -= 1
        else:
            break
    # If there's still k left, distribute it to the last few elements
    if k > 0:
        result[-1] += k
    return result
```

This solution initializes the first `min(k, n)` elements to 1, which ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized. If there is any remaining sum `k`, it is added to the last element. This approach guarantees that the sum of the sequence is `k` and the bitwise OR is maximized.
