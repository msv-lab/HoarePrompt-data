Reasoning:
- The given program does not correctly implement the problem statement. The program reads `N` test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` and then calls `func_1(i)` for every `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. However, according to the problem statement, Vladislav writes the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive and then replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. Therefore, `func_1(i)` should be called for every integer from 1 to `n`, not from 0 to `n-1`.
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a number, but it is being used incorrectly in the main part of the program.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem's instructions properly.

Correctness: **False**
