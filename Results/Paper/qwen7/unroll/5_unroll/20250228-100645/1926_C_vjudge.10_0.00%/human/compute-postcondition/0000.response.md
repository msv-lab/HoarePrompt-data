Output State: **The program returns the sum of the digits of the positive integer n, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.**

This means that the program converts the integer `n` into a string, iterates over each digit in the string representation of `n`, converts each digit back to an integer, and sums these integers. The result of this summation is then returned.
