Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program calculates the sum of the digits for each number from 0 to \( n-1 \) and sums these values, rather than calculating the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to \( n \).

For example, consider the input `n = 3`:
- According to the problem description, the numbers on the board should be: 1, 2, 3.
- The sum of these numbers is: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
- However, the program will calculate the sum of the digits for 0, 1, 2, which results in: 0 + 1 + 2 = 3.

This discrepancy shows that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
