### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Vladislav writes the integers from 1 to \( n \), inclusive.
- Each integer is replaced with the sum of its digits.
- We need to find the sum of these new numbers.

#### Given Program:
```python
soma = 0
N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)
```

#### Function Definition:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
```

#### Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( N \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and processes numbers from 0 to \( n-1 \).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes an integer \( n \) and returns the sum of its digits.
   - For example, `func_1(12)` returns 3 because the sum of digits of 12 is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The outer loop runs \( N \) times.
   - For each test case, the inner loop runs \( n \) times, processing numbers from 0 to \( n-1 \).
   - The sum of the digits of each number from 0 to \( n-1 \) is added to `soma`.

#### Key Points:
- The program processes numbers from 0 to \( n-1 \) instead of from 1 to \( n \).
- This means it includes the number 0, which has a digit sum of 0, and excludes the number \( n \).

#### Example Analysis:
- For \( n = 3 \):
  - Numbers processed: 0, 1, 2
  - Digit sums: 0, 1, 2
  - Sum of these digit sums: \( 0 + 1 + 2 = 3 \)
  - Expected result: 6 (from 1, 2, 3)

This analysis confirms that the program does not meet the problem requirements, as it processes numbers from 0 to \( n-1 \) instead of from 1 to \( n \).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program is incorrect because it processes numbers from 0 to \( n-1 \) instead of from 1 to \( n \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
