Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Provided Problem Description:
The problem description is not explicitly provided in the question, but from the code, it seems the task is to:
- Generate `.py` files (specifically `ac.py` and `wa.py`) for each `.html` file found in subfolders whose names are within a specified numeric range.
- The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` should be called with a specific range of folders (1951 to 1980).

### Given Code Analysis:

1. **Function Definition and Directory Scanning:**
   - The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` correctly identifies all subdirectories in the current working directory.
   - It filters these directories to include only those that are named with digits within the specified range (`start` to `end`).
   - For each such directory, it lists all `.html` files and prints the count of these files.

2. **File Generation:**
   - For each `.html` file in the filtered directories, it generates two corresponding `.py` files (`{base_name}-ac.py` and `{base_name}-wa.py`).
   - These files are created using `open(ac_file, 'w').close()` and `open(wa_file, 'w').close()`, which effectively creates empty files.

3. **Main Functionality:**
   - The main part of the script calls `generate_files_for_html_in_range(1951, 1980)` to execute the logic with the specified range.

### Provided Additional Function:
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        cnt1 = s.count('1')
        if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif cnt1 > 2:
            print('NO')
        elif cnt1 == 1:
            print('NO')
        elif '11' in s:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```
- This function `func_1` is defined but never called in the provided script.
- It appears to be unrelated to the task of generating files for HTML directories.

### Conclusion:
The primary functionality of the script, which is to generate `.py` files for `.html` files in specified directories, is correctly implemented. The additional function `func_1` is irrelevant to the main task and does not affect the correctness of the file generation logic.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
