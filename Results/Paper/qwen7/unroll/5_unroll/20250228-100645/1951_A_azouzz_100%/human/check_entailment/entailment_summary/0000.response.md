Reasoning:
The provided program consists of two separate functions and does not match the problem description or the execution summary provided. The problem description and execution summary describe a program that generates `.py` files for each `.html` file found in specified directories. However, the given program `func_1()` reads multiple strings `s` from input, each corresponding to a directory name, and checks each string for specific conditions related to the count of '1's and the presence of the substring '11'. 

Given the mismatch between the problem description and the provided code, the program does not perform the task described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description is:

Correctness: **False**
