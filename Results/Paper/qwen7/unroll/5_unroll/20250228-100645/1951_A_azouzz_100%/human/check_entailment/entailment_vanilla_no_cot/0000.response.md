Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem description asks for a Python program that generates `.ac.py` and `.wa.py` files for each `.html` file in specified subfolders. However, the given program `func_1` reads input from stdin and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the count of '1's in a string and whether the string contains '11'. This does not align with the task described in the problem statement.
