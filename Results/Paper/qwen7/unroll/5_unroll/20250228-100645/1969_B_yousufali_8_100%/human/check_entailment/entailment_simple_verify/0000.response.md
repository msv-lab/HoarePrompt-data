### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its behavior step-by-step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem.

#### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The cost of each operation is the length of the chosen substring.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `n` to 0 and `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and increments `n` whenever it encounters a '1'.
   - When it encounters a '0', it adds `n + 1` to `ans` and resets `n` to 0.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
- **Initial State:** `s` is a binary string.
- **Function `func_1`:**
  - Iterates through the string `s`.
  - Counts consecutive '1's and adds `n + 1` to `ans` when a '0' is encountered.
  - Resets `n` to 0 after adding to `ans`.
  - Prints `ans`.
- **Function `func_2`:**
  - Reads `t`, the number of test cases.
  - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Example Analysis:
- **Input:** "101011"
- **Expected Output:** 7 (Optimal strategy: 3 + 2 + 2)
- **Actual Output:** 5 (Program logic: 3 + 2 + 0)

The program logic in `func_1` is flawed because it does not account for the optimal strategy of performing multiple smaller shifts. Instead, it calculates the cost based on the longest sequence of '1's before a '0'. This approach does not always yield the minimum cost.

#### Detailed Example:
- **String:** "101011"
- **Program Logic:**
  - First '0': "101011" → "010111" (cost = 3)
  - Second '0': "010111" → "010111" (cost = 2)
  - Third '0': "010111" → "010111" (cost = 0)
  - Total cost: 3 + 2 + 0 = 5

- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - First shift: "101011" → "101101" (cost = 3)
  - Second shift: "101101" → "101110" (cost = 2)
  - Third shift: "101110" → "101110" (cost = 2)
  - Total cost: 3 + 2 + 2 = 7

The program logic does not capture the optimal strategy, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The logic in `func_1` does not account for the optimal strategy of performing cyclic shifts.

**Final: False**
