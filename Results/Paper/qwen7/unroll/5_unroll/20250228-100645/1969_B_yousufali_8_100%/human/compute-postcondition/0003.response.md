The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the input is a binary string `s` (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2⋅10^5) representing the string that needs to be sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The function does not return a value directly but processes `t` test cases, each involving a binary string `s`. Based on the input string `s`, the function determines if it can be sorted in non-descending order through cyclic shifts and returns appropriate results for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts a binary string `s` and checks if `s` can be sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts, returning the result for each test case.**
