### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Each cyclic shift operation has a cost equal to the length of the substring shifted.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a binary string `s` as input.
   - It initializes `n` to 0 and `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates through the string `s`:
     - If it encounters a '1', it increments `n`.
     - If it encounters a '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans` and resets `n` to 0.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` which processes the binary string and prints the result.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string. It identifies segments of consecutive '1's and '0's and ensures that the '0's come before the '1's.
   - The cost calculation is correct because each '0' that needs to be moved past a segment of '1's will require a shift of the length of that segment plus one.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in both functions, the program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
