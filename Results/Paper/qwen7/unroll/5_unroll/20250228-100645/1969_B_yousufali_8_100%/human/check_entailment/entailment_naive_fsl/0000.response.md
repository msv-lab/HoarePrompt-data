Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The logic in `func_1` does not account for the optimal strategy of performing cyclic shifts. For instance, consider the input "101011". The program would incorrectly calculate the cost as 5, but the optimal strategy involves multiple smaller shifts:

1. Choose the substring [3, 5]: "101011" → "101101"
2. Choose the substring [4, 6]: "101101" → "101110"
3. Choose the substring [5, 6]: "101110" → "101110"

The total cost would be 3 + 2 + 2 = 7, which is not calculated by the provided function. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
