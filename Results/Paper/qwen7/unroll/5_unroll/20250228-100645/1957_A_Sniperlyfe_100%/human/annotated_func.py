#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of the list is the number of sticks available (1 <= n <= 100). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `freq` is a dictionary where each key-value pair represents a unique stick length from the list `arr` and its corresponding frequency of occurrence in the list, respectively.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 3, where each frequency represents the number of times a unique stick length appears in the list `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers representing the lengths of sticks. It calculates the frequency of each unique stick length in the list and then returns the sum of the integer division of these frequencies by 3.
