You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: Output State: The output will consist of lines corresponding to each test case. For each test case, it will print pairs of integers from the array `a` that appear exactly twice, followed by any single integers that appear once, up to `k` such integers. After that, it will print the remaining single integers. If the count of pairs (`ul`) does not match the count of single integers (`ur`), it will continue printing pairs until they match.
    #
    #In more detail, for each test case:
    #- It first prints pairs of integers that appear exactly twice, up to `k` pairs.
    #- Then it prints up to `k` single integers that appear once.
    #- Finally, it prints any remaining single integers.
    #
    #This process ensures that the output respects the constraints on `n`, `k`, and the structure of the array `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer \( t \) (the number of test cases), \( n \) (the size of the array divided by 2), \( k \) (an integer constraint), and an array \( a \) of length \( 2n \) where each integer from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly twice. For each test case, it prints pairs of integers from \( a \) that appear exactly twice, up to \( k \) pairs. Then, it prints up to \( k \) single integers that appear once. Finally, it prints any remaining single integers. If the count of pairs does not match the count of single integers, it continues printing pairs until they match.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the required subsets `l` and `r` for all potential cases. Specifically, the program attempts to construct the subsets `l` and `r` by directly using the counts of elements in the first half and second half of the array `a`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` will equal the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

Consider the following test case:
```
4 2
5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2
```

Expected output:
```
3 3 5 5
6 4 2 4
```

However, the provided program might output something like:
```
3 3 5 5
6 4 2 6
```

This is incorrect because the XOR of `[3, 3, 5, 5]` is `3 ^ 3 ^ 5 ^ 5 = 0`, but the XOR of `[6, 4, 2, 6]` is `6 ^ 4 ^ 2 ^ 6 = 4`, which does not match.

The program fails to ensure that the XOR values of the generated subsets `l` and `r` are equal, which is a critical requirement according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
