Output State: The output will consist of lines corresponding to each test case. For each test case, it will print pairs of integers from the array `a` that appear exactly twice, followed by any single integers that appear once, up to `k` such integers. After that, it will print the remaining single integers. If the count of pairs (`ul`) does not match the count of single integers (`ur`), it will continue printing pairs until they match.

In more detail, for each test case:
- It first prints pairs of integers that appear exactly twice, up to `k` pairs.
- Then it prints up to `k` single integers that appear once.
- Finally, it prints any remaining single integers.

This process ensures that the output respects the constraints on `n`, `k`, and the structure of the array `a`.
