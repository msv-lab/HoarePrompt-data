Reasoning:  
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find a simple cycle with the minimum weight edge in an undirected weighted graph. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Parsing**: The code correctly parses the input for each test case, including the number of vertices (`n`), the number of edges (`m`), and the edges themselves (`u`, `v`, `w`).

2. **Graph Construction**: The graph is constructed using an adjacency list representation, and edges are stored in a list of tuples sorted in descending order by weight.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**: The DSU class is used to efficiently manage the connected components of the graph. The `union` method ensures that cycles are detected and the minimum edge weight within each component is tracked.

4. **Finding Minimum Weight Cycle**: By iterating over the edges in reverse order (starting with the heaviest edge), the code identifies the first cycle formed by the heaviest edge. This ensures that the cycle found has the minimum possible edge weight.

5. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: The DFS function is used to trace the path from the identified node back to form a cycle. If the DFS detects a cycle, it returns the path; otherwise, it continues searching.

6. **Output**: The code correctly prints the minimum edge weight and the nodes forming the cycle for each test case.

Given that the code follows the problem description accurately and handles all necessary steps to find the required cycle, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
