Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge.
2. The provided code consists of several functions, but the primary logic is in `func_6` and `dfs`.
3. `func_6` constructs the graph, sorts the edges in descending order of weights, and uses a DSU to find the minimum edge weight in a cycle.
4. `dfs` is used to find a cycle starting from a node and ensuring no backtracking to the parent node.
5. The code correctly handles multiple test cases in `func_7`.
6. The output format matches the problem requirements, printing the minimum edge weight and the vertices of the cycle.

Given the execution summaries and the problem description, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution. It processes each test case, constructs the graph, finds the minimum edge weight in a cycle, and then identifies a cycle containing that edge using DFS.

Correctness: **True**
