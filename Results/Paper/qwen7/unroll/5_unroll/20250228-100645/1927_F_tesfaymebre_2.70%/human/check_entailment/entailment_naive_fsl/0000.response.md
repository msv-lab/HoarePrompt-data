Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Union-Find Logic**: The `DSU` (Disjoint Set Union) structure used in the `func_6` function is not correctly implemented. Specifically, the `union` method does not properly handle the merging of sets and updating the minimum edge weights. This can lead to incorrect results, especially when multiple cycles are present.

2. **Cycle Detection and Path Construction**: The `dfs` function is used to detect cycles and construct paths, but it does not ensure that the cycle found is the one with the minimal lightest edge. The current implementation may find a cycle but not necessarily the one with the smallest lightest edge.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all possible edge cases, such as graphs with multiple cycles and varying edge weights. For instance, if there are multiple cycles with different lightest edges, the program might not correctly identify the cycle with the minimal lightest edge.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

```
3
4 6
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 1 3
4 1 4
1 3 1
3 4 1
4 6
1 2 10
2 3 8
3 1 5
4 1 100
1 3 5
3 4 40
4 6
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 1 3
4 1 4
1 3 1
3 4 1
```

The expected output should be:

```
1 3
1 2 3
1 4
1 4 3 2
1 4
1 4 3 2
```

However, the provided program might not correctly identify the cycle with the minimal lightest edge in some cases, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description.
