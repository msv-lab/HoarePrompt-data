You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by positive integers n and q, an array c of n positive integers, and q queries. For each query, it compares the sum of elements in the array c from index l to r with the count of elements greater than 1 in the same range. If the sum is greater than or equal to the count and l is not equal to r, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify the input arrays c, a, and b, and it does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, followed by the array `c` and then `q` queries.
   
2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to handle the logic for determining if a subarray is good.
   - It initializes arrays `a` and `b` where `a` is the prefix sum of the input array `c` and `b` is another array used for some calculations.
   - The array `b` is constructed such that `b[i]` represents the sum of the smallest possible values that can be assigned to the first `i` elements of `c` while ensuring they are distinct and positive.
   - The construction of `b` seems incorrect because it always sets `b[i]` to `b[i-1] + 1` or `2` regardless of the actual values in `c`. This does not ensure that the sum of `b` matches the sum of `a`.

3. **Checking Subarrays:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the subarray from `l_i` to `r_i` is good by comparing the sums of the prefix sums `a` and `b`.
   - However, the way `b` is constructed does not guarantee that the subarray can be transformed into a good array.

### Detailed Issues:
- **Incorrect Construction of `b`:**
  - The array `b` should be constructed such that the sum of `b` equals the sum of `a` and all elements in `b` are distinct and positive. The current implementation does not achieve this.
  - For example, if `c = [1, 2, 1, 4, 5]`, the correct `b` should be something like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` to match the sum of `a` and ensure all elements are distinct and positive.

- **Comparison Logic:**
  - The comparison `if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y` is flawed. It does not correctly determine if the subarray can be transformed into a good array.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the construction of `b` and the comparison logic, the program does not correctly determine if a subarray is good according to the problem statement.
