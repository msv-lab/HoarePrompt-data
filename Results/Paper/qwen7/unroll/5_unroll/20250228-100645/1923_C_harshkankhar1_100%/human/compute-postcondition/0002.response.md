Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5, the array `c` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, the list `a` is `[0]` followed by integers split from input, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, the list `b` is a list of length n+1 filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `b` with `n + 1` zeros. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, or `a`. Therefore, those variables retain their initial states. The new list `b` is created and initialized to contain `n + 1` elements, all set to 0.
