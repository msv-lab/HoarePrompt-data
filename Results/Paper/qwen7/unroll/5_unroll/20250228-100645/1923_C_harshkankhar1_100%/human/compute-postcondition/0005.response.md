Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5, the array `c` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, the list `a` is `[0]` followed by integers split from input, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, the list `b` is a list of length n+1 where each element b[i] (for i from 1 to n) is equal to the number of times an integer greater than 1 appears before index i in list `a`.
