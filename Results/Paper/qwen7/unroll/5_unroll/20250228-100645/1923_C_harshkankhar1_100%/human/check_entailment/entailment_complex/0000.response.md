Reasoning:
1. The problem requires checking if a subarray is "good" based on specific conditions.
2. The annotated program does not match the problem description and the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:
   - The function `func_1()` does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is "good".
   - The logic to check if a subarray is "good" is not implemented at all.
   - The variables `a` and `b` are not used correctly to determine if the subarray meets the conditions.
   - The logic to calculate the sum of elements in the subarray and compare it with the count of elements greater than 1 in the subarray is missing.

Given the above points, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
