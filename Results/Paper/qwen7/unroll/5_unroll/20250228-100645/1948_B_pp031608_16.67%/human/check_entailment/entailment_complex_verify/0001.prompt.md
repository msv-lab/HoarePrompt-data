You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers (`lst`) where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50. It checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order and returns a boolean value (`True` if the list is sorted, `False` otherwise).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - This part is correct and works as expected.

2. **Checking if the Array is Already Sorted:**
   - The function `func_1(lst)` checks if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the list is already sorted, it prints 'Yes' and exits the loop for that test case.
   - This part is correct but redundant since the main logic should handle sorting.

3. **Main Logic for Sorting:**
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - It calls `func_1(list1)` at the start of the loop, which is unnecessary because the main logic should handle sorting.
   - If the previous element (`list1[p - 1]`) is greater than the current element (`list1[p]`) and the previous element is at least 10, it performs the digit splitting operation.
     - It removes the previous element and inserts its digits in the same position.
   - After the loop, it checks if the array is sorted using `func_1(list1)`.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Redundant Function Call:**
   - The call to `func_1(list1)` at the start of the loop is unnecessary and can be removed.
   - This call does not affect the final result but makes the code less efficient.

2. **Logic for Splitting Digits:**
   - The logic for splitting digits is correct but can be simplified.
   - Instead of checking if the element is greater than 10, it should directly check if the element is at least 10 before performing the split.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array might become invalid after splitting (e.g., leading zeros).
   - For example, if the array is `[10, 20, 30]`, splitting `10` results in `[1, 0, 20, 30]`, which is still sorted but the original array was valid.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Attempt to sort the array by splitting digits
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        while list1[p - 1] >= 10 and list1[p - 1] > list1[p]:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    
    # Check if the array is now sorted
    if list1 == sorted(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and making necessary corrections, the original program is almost correct but can be optimized and simplified. Therefore, the initial program is **Correctness: True** with some minor improvements.

Correctness: **True**
