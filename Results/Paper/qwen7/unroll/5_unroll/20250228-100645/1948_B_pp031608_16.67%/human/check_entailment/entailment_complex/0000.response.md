Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Main Loop Logic**: The main loop iterates through the list `list1` and calls `func_1` to check if the list is sorted. If `func_1` returns `False`, it attempts to modify the list by splitting a number greater than 10 into its digits. However, the logic for modifying the list is flawed:
   - It only checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and greater than 10, which is not sufficient to ensure the list can be sorted.
   - The modification process (splitting a number and inserting its digits) is done in place without considering the overall sorted order after the split.

2. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` simply checks if the list is already sorted, which is not the intended behavior. The function should simulate the operations allowed and check if the list can be sorted through those operations.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the list cannot be sorted even if some elements are split.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to sort the array using the allowed operations.

Correctness: **False**
