Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Checking if the Array is Already Sorted:**
   - The program calls `func_1(list1)` to check if the array is already sorted.
   - If `func_1(list1)` returns `True`, it prints 'Yes' and moves to the next test case.
   
3. **Modifying the Array to Check if It Can Be Sorted:**
   - If the array is not already sorted, the program enters a loop to try to sort the array by breaking down elements greater than or equal to 10.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the previous element (`list1[p - 1]`) is greater than the current element (`list1[p]`) and if the previous element is greater than 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
   - After attempting to modify the array, it again checks if the array is sorted using `func_1(list1)`.
   - If the array is sorted after modifications, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the given list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version.
   - If the list matches its sorted version, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic in Modifying the Array:**
   - The logic inside the loop to modify the array is flawed. Specifically, the code attempts to split an element only if the previous element is greater than the current element and greater than 10. However, this does not guarantee that the array will eventually become sorted.
   - The approach of splitting elements only when the previous element is greater than the current one might not work in all cases. For example, consider the array `[34, 21]`. Splitting `34` would result in `[3, 4, 21]`, but the array is still not sorted.

2. **Missing Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as arrays that cannot be sorted through the described operations.

3. **Unnecessary Function Call:**
   - The function `func_1` is called multiple times unnecessarily. It should be called only once per test case to check if the final state of the array is sorted.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the logic and handling of edge cases, the provided program is not correct for the given problem.

**Correctness: False**
