### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program has a few issues but overall follows the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Redundant Function Call:**
   - The function `func_1(list1)` is called at the start of the loop, which is unnecessary. This can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.

2. **Logic for Splitting Digits:**
   - The logic for splitting digits is correct. However, it can be simplified by removing the redundant function call and ensuring that the splitting logic is applied only when necessary.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the splitting logic correctly, but it does not explicitly handle edge cases like leading zeros or invalid splits. However, these edge cases do not affect the overall correctness of the program as long as the resulting array remains valid and sorted.

4. **Main Logic Flow:**
   - The main logic flow is correct. It iterates through the array, applies the digit splitting operation when necessary, and then checks if the array is sorted.

Given these points, the original program is logically sound and will produce the correct output for the given problem. The only suggestion for improvement is to remove the redundant function call and simplify the logic slightly.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct with minor improvements.
