Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - This part is correct and works as expected.

2. **Checking if the Array is Already Sorted:**
   - The function `func_1(lst)` checks if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the list is already sorted, it prints 'Yes' and exits the loop for that test case.
   - This part is correct but redundant since the main logic should handle sorting.

3. **Main Logic for Sorting:**
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - It calls `func_1(list1)` at the start of the loop, which is unnecessary because the main logic should handle sorting.
   - If the previous element (`list1[p - 1]`) is greater than the current element (`list1[p]`) and the previous element is at least 10, it performs the digit splitting operation.
     - It removes the previous element and inserts its digits in the same position.
   - After the loop, it checks if the array is sorted using `func_1(list1)`.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Redundant Function Call:**
   - The call to `func_1(list1)` at the start of the loop is unnecessary and can be removed.
   - This call does not affect the final result but makes the code less efficient.

2. **Logic for Splitting Digits:**
   - The logic for splitting digits is correct but can be simplified.
   - Instead of checking if the element is greater than 10, it should directly check if the element is at least 10 before performing the split.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array might become invalid after splitting (e.g., leading zeros).
   - For example, if the array is `[10, 20, 30]`, splitting `10` results in `[1, 0, 20, 30]`, which is still sorted but the original array was valid.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Attempt to sort the array by splitting digits
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        while list1[p - 1] >= 10 and list1[p - 1] > list1[p]:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    
    # Check if the array is now sorted
    if list1 == sorted(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and making necessary corrections, the original program is almost correct but can be optimized and simplified. Therefore, the initial program is **Correctness: True** with some minor improvements.
