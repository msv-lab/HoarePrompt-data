Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), and for each t, two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n) are provided. The function returns a result based on the given conditions for each test case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing values for t, n, and k, and for each set of these values, it performs some operation or checks certain conditions and returns a result accordingly.
