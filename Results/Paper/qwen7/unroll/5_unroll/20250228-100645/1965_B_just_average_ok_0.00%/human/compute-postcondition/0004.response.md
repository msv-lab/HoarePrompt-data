Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\). It then constructs a list `nums` containing five specific elements: three fixed elements which are powers of 2 up to \(2^{24}\), a dynamically calculated element based on \(k\), and two additional elements derived from \(k\). After constructing the list, it removes one of the fixed elements and prints the length of the resulting list followed by its elements. This process is repeated for each test case provided.**
