Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.
2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The program constructs a list `nums` initially containing powers of 2 up to \(2^{24}\).
   - It then calculates an index `idx` which points to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
   - It appends `k - nums[idx]` to ensure that subsequences summing to `k` are not possible.
   - It also appends `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to ensure that all sums from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed.
   - Finally, it removes `1 << idx` from the list to ensure the length of `nums` is 5.
3. **Output**: The program prints the length of `nums` and the elements of `nums`.

However, the problem requires a sequence of size at most 25, and the constructed sequence has a fixed length of 5. This approach does not satisfy the requirement that the sequence size can be at most 25 for larger values of `k`.

To meet the problem's requirements, the sequence needs to be dynamically constructed to ensure it meets the conditions for all possible values of `n` and `k`. The current approach only works for small values of `k` and does not scale to larger values of `k`.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not fully meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
