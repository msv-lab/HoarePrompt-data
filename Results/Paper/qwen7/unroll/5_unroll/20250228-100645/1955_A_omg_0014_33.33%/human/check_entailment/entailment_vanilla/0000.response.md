Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the price of one yogurt, the price of two yogurts, and the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, respectively.

2. **Calculating the Cost:**
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is the price of one yogurt under the promotion.
   - It then compares `a * b` (the cost without promotion) with `a * d` (the cost with promotion).
   - If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, it prints `a * b`. Otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `d`:**
   - The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which is not correct. The correct calculation should be `d = b / 2` because `b` is the price for two yogurts.

2. **Comparison Logic:**
   - The logic to decide whether to use the promotion or not is flawed. The comparison should be between the total cost of buying all yogurts individually (`a * n`) and the total cost using the promotion (`b * ceil(n / 2)`).

3. **Rounding Issue:**
   - The use of `round(a * d)` might not always give the minimum cost. For example, if `n` is odd, the correct approach would be to buy `n // 2` pairs at the promotion price and the remaining one at the individual price.

### Corrected Program:

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (n_yogurts, price_per_yogurt, price_for_two) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying all yogurts individually
        cost_individual = n_yogurts * price_per_yogurt
        # Calculate the cost of buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price
        pairs = n_yogurts // 2
        remaining = n_yogurts % 2
        cost_promotion = pairs * (price_for_two) + remaining * price_per_yogurt
        # Print the minimum cost
        print(min(cost_individual, cost_promotion))

# Example usage:
func()
```

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the original program, the provided solution is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
