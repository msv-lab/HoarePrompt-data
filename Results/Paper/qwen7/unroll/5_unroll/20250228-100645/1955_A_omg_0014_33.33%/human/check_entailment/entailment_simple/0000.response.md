Reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which seems to be a typo and should be `b / 2`. This value represents the promotional price for two yogurts divided by two.
4. It then checks whether buying one yogurt at the regular price (`a`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotional price (`b`). If so, it prints `a * b` (which should be `a * n`).
5. Otherwise, it prints `round(b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2))`, which correctly calculates the minimum cost by considering the full pairs of yogurts at the promotional price and any remaining yogurts at the regular price.

However, there is a logical error in the condition check. The condition `if a * b < a * d:` should be `if a * b < b * 2:` because the promotional price for two yogurts is `b`, not `c`.

Here's the corrected version of the logic inside the loop:

```python
if a * b < b * 2:
    print(a * n)
else:
    print(round(b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)))
```

Given this analysis, the original program has a logical error in the condition check, which affects its correctness.

Correctness: **False**
