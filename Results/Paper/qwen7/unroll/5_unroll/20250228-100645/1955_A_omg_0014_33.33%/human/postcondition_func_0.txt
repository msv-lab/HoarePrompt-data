The function processes multiple test cases, each containing three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates either \( a \times b \) or \( a \times \frac{c}{2} \) (where \( c \) is another integer read from input), and prints the result. The function does not return any value but prints the calculated values for each test case.
