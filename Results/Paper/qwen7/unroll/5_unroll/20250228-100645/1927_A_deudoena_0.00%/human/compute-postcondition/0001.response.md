Output State: **`ind1` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `inpstr` is the input string which is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell, and it is guaranteed that at least one cell in `inpstr` is black.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ind1` to 0. No other changes are made to the values of `t` or `inpstr`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `t` and `inpstr`, while `ind1` is explicitly set to 0.
