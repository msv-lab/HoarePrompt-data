t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'B' represents a black cell and 'W' represents a white cell, and it is guaranteed that at least one cell in s is black.
