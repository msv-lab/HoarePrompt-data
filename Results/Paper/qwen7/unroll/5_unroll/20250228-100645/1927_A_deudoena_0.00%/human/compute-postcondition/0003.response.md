Output State: **`ind1` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `inpstr` is the input string which is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0**.

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `outind`. Since `ind1`, `t`, `inpstr`, and `ind2` were not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged.
