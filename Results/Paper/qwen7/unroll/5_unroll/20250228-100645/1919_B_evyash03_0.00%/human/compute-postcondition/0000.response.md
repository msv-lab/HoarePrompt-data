Output State: **`count` is 0, `expression` is a string of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-", and length is an integer representing the length of the string expression.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `count` to 0. No changes are made to the `expression` or `length` variables. Therefore, the length of the `expression` string and its composition remain unchanged, and `count` is set to 0.
