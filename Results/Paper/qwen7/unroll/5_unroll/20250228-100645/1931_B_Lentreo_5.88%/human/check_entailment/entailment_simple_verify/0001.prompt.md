You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and there are n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

    #State: Output State: The output state consists of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case, depending on whether the cumulative sum of non-zero numbers in the list equals zero after processing all elements in the list. For each test case, it checks if the sum of differences between each element (except the last one) and the last element is zero; if it is, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of containers.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers representing the amount of water in each container.

2. **Key Logic:**
   - The program calculates the difference between the last element (`last`) and each other element (`i`) in the list.
   - It sums these differences into `curr`.
   - If `curr` is zero, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

### Detailed Explanation

#### Problem Understanding:
- We need to check if we can make all containers have the same amount of water using the allowed operations.
- The key insight here is that the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, so the target amount of water per container would be the total amount divided by `n`.

#### Program Logic:
- The program attempts to check if the sum of differences between each element and the last element is zero.
- This approach is flawed because:
  - It only considers the difference between each element and the last element, not the overall distribution.
  - It doesn't ensure that the total amount of water can be evenly distributed among all containers.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
- Consider the test case `[4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`:
  - The total amount of water is `15`, and `15 % 5 == 0`, so the target amount per container is `3`.
  - However, the program checks differences against the last element `3` instead of checking if the total can be evenly distributed.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the water can be evenly distributed among all containers. The program fails to consider the overall distribution of water and only checks differences against the last element.

### Correctness: **False**
