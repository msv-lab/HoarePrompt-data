Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The logic used in the program is flawed.

Here's why the program is incorrect:
- The program calculates `curr` as the sum of differences between each element and the last element in the list. This does not guarantee that the containers can be made equal.
- The condition `if curr == 0` is not sufficient to determine if the containers can be made equal. The key point is that the total amount of water must be evenly distributed among the containers, which means the average amount of water per container should be an integer.

To fix this, the program should check if the total amount of water (sum of `nums`) is divisible by `n`. If it is, then it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_water = sum(nums)
        if total_water % n == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected version checks if the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, which is the correct approach to solve the problem.
