Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n. For each test case, it returns whether the sum condition is met.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It checks if the sum of these integers `a_i` is divisible by `n` for each test case and returns a result indicating whether this condition holds true for each case.
