Output State: The output state consists of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case, depending on whether the cumulative difference between each non-zero number and the last number in the list is zero or not. For each test case, if the sum of differences is zero, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
