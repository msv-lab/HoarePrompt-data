Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The program checks if the sum of differences between each element and the last element is zero, which is not a valid approach.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
4 5 2 1 3
```

The program will calculate the sum of differences as follows:
- Difference between 4 and 3: 1
- Difference between 5 and 3: 2
- Difference between 2 and 3: 1
- Difference between 1 and 3: 2

Sum of differences: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6

Since the sum is not zero, the program outputs "NO", which is incorrect because it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water (3 units each) by pouring water appropriately.

A correct approach would involve checking if the average amount of water per container can be achieved by pouring water from higher to lower amounts, ensuring the sum of water is evenly distributed.
