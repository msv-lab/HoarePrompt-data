Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to an empty string. The initial state of `s` and `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, `s` is still a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and `n` is still the length of `s`. The new information is that `ans` is an empty string.
