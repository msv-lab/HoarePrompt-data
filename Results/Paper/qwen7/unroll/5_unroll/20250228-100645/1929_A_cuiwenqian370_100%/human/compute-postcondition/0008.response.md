Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over the `results` list. Therefore, the objects involved in the loop head are `result`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `result`**: Since the loop is iterating over `results`, the initial value of `result` should be the first element of the `results` list.

3. **Check the given state**: The given state includes `t`, `n`, `array`, `data`, `index`, and `results`. We need to focus on adjusting the state of `result` based on the information provided.

4. **Adjust the state**: The state before the loop starts is defined as follows:
   - `t` is now the integer value of `data[0]`.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `array` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \([1, 10^9]\).
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.
   - `index` is equal to \(2 \times t + 1\).
   - `results` is a list of `t` elements where each element is the result of calling `func_1` on a list of `n` integers.

5. **State adjustment**: For the loop to execute, `result` must be the first element of the `results` list. Given that `results` is a list of `t` elements, the first element of `results` is `results[0]`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `result` to be the first element of the `results` list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`result` is the first element of the `results` list (i.e., `result` is `results[0]`)**
