Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `array`, a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]. The function computes the maximum beauty of the array for each test case and returns the result.**
