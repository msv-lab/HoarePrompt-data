### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - The beauty can be maximized by sorting the array and calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements after sorting.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - Sorting ensures that the differences are minimized between smaller and larger elements, thus maximizing the overall sum of differences.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input in a stream and processing each one separately.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For the first test case: `[2, 1, 3]`, sorting gives `[1, 2, 3]`. The beauty is `(2-1) + (3-2) = 2`.
   - For the second test case: `[69, 69, 69]`, the beauty is `0` since all elements are the same.
   - For the third test case: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, sorting gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`. The beauty is `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 57`.
   - For the fourth test case: `[3, 4, 3, 3]`, sorting gives `[3, 3, 3, 4]`. The beauty is `(3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 1`.
   - For the fifth test case: `[2, 1]`, sorting gives `[1, 2]`. The beauty is `(2-1) = 1`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Both functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the original assessment, I notice that the original assessment did not fully consider the impact of the sorting operation on the beauty calculation. Specifically, the original assessment assumed that sorting would always maximize the beauty, but it does not account for the fact that the beauty is maximized when the smallest elements are placed before the largest ones in a sorted array.

Upon re-evaluation, the original assessment is accurate because the provided examples and the logic of the functions confirm that sorting the array indeed maximizes the beauty as required by the problem statement.
