Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`.
2. The `func_1` function sorts the array and calculates the sum of absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements. This approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty because sorting does not consider the specific arrangement needed to maximize the differences.
3. However, the correct approach to maximize the beauty would be to arrange the array such that the largest element is paired with the smallest element, the second largest with the second smallest, and so on. This way, the positive differences will be maximized.
4. The `func_2` function reads the input correctly and processes each test case by calling `func_1`, which calculates the beauty of the array after sorting. Although sorting does not guarantee the maximum beauty, the problem statement does not specify that the input array must be sorted to achieve the maximum beauty. Instead, it should be rearranged optimally.
5. Given that the problem asks for the maximum beauty and the solution involves rearranging the array, the current implementation using `func_1` (which sorts the array) is not optimal but still meets the requirement of calculating the beauty of some arrangement. Since the problem does not explicitly state that sorting is the optimal solution, we should assume that the current implementation is acceptable.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution uses sorting to calculate the beauty, which does not necessarily yield the maximum possible beauty. The correct approach would involve rearranging the array to maximize the differences between consecutive elements, but the current implementation does not do this. Therefore, the solution is not fully correct according to the problem's requirements.
