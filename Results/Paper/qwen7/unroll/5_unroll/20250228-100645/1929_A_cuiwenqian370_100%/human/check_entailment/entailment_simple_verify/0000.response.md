### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` takes an array and calculates the beauty by sorting it and then summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
- This approach does not guarantee the maximum beauty because sorting the array may not always produce the optimal sequence for maximizing the sum of differences.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- The input handling and the way `func_1` is called are correct according to the problem statement.

#### Correctness of the Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not always yield the maximum beauty due to the sorting step in `func_1`.
- The example provided in the original assessment demonstrates that sorting the array does not always lead to the maximum beauty. For instance, the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]` should have a maximum beauty of 57, but sorting it results in a beauty of -5, which is incorrect.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases because the sorting approach does not guarantee the maximum beauty.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
