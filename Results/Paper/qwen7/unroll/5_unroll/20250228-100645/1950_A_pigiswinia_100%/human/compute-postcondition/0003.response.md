Output State: The output state will consist of strings printed during each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided. Specifically, for each line of input (a, b, c) where `i` ranges from 0 to `t-1`, the output will be either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' depending on whether `a < b < c`, `a < b > c`, or neither condition is met, respectively.
