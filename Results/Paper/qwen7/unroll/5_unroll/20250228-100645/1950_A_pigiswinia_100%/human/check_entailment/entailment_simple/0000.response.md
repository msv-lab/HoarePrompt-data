Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.
3. The program checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`).
4. If the conditions are met, it prints the corresponding string ('STAIR' or 'PEAK').
5. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.
6. The logic and conditions provided in the code match the problem description exactly.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem statement and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
