Reasoning:
1. The problem description specifies that the conditions for a stair and a peak are:
   - A stair: `a < b < c`
   - A peak: `a < b > c`
2. The provided program correctly implements these conditions:
   - It checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if true.
   - It checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if true.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.
3. The program iterates over `t` test cases, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case and applying the conditions correctly.
4. The execution summary matches the program's behavior, indicating that the program processes each test case as specified and outputs the correct results.

Based on this analysis, the program is implemented correctly according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
