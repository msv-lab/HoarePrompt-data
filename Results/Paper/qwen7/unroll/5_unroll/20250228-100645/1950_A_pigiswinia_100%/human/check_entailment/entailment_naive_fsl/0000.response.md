Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program uses `elif` instead of `else` after checking for the "STAIR" condition. This means that if the first condition (`a < b < c`) is not met, the program will check the second condition (`a < b > c`). However, if both conditions are false, the program will still print "NONE" instead of continuing to the next possible condition, which is that neither "STAIR" nor "PEAK" is true, meaning the digits form neither a stair nor a peak.

To fix this, the program should use `else` after the second condition to ensure that if neither "STAIR" nor "PEAK" is true, it prints "NONE". Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This ensures that all potential cases are handled correctly.
