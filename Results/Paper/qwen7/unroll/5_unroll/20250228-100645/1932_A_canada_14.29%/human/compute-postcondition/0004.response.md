Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer t and a string of length n containing '.', '@', and '*' characters. For each test case, it counts the number of '@' (coins) encountered before two consecutive '*' (thorns) are found. If two thorns are encountered, the counting stops. The function prints the count of coins for each test case.**
