Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `for` loop to iterate over the range of values returned by `range(int(input()))`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`.
   - We need to ensure that `int(input())` provides a valid number of iterations.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - Each test case involves an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - The second line of input is a string of length `n` consisting of '.', '@', and '*' characters.
   - The first character of the string is always '.', indicating the starting cell is empty.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop will run for the number of times specified by `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is within the valid range for `t`.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, `t` should be a valid positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)**.
