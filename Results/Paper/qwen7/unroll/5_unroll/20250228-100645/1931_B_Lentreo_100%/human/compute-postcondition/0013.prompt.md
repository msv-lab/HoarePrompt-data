You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container, where the length of nums is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and the sum of the elements in nums is divisible by n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^9).
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if (total % n != 0) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `n` is the length of `nums`, and the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`; `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`. The total sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`.
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is the length of `nums`, the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`; `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`, `curr` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in `nums`, updating `curr` by adding the difference between the current element and the mean to `curr`. If at any point `curr` becomes less than 0, the function returns 'NO'. However, since the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`, and `curr` starts at 0, it will never go negative because each addition of `(nums[i] - mean)` will either keep `curr` at 0 or make it positive (since `nums[i] - mean` can be negative but the sum of these differences over all elements will balance out to 0 due to the divisibility condition). Therefore, the loop completes without returning 'NO', and `curr` remains 0.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter nums, which is a list of integers. It returns 'NO' if it's not possible to distribute the water equally among the containers. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'NO'

Case_2: The program returns 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
