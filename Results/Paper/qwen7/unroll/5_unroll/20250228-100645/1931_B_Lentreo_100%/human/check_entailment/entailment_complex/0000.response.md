Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads the number of containers (`n`) and the amounts of water in each container (`nums`).
- The function `func_1(nums)` is designed to check if it is possible to distribute the water equally among the containers.
- The function calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers. If not, it immediately returns 'NO'.
- It then calculates the mean amount of water per container and iterates through the list, maintaining a running sum of the differences between the current water amount and the mean. This ensures that the cumulative difference does not become negative, which would indicate an impossible redistribution.
- If the cumulative difference remains non-negative throughout the iteration, the function returns 'YES', indicating that equal distribution is possible.
- Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the function correctly determines whether the water can be evenly distributed.

Correctness: **True**
