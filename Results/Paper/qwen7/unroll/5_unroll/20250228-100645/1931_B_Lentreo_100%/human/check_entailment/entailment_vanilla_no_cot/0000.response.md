Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operations. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sum Calculation and Mean Determination**: For each test case, it calculates the total amount of water and checks if this total is divisible by the number of containers `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'NO' because it's impossible to distribute the water evenly.
3. **Distribution Feasibility Check**: It then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a running difference between the current cumulative amount and the target mean value. If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means the distribution is not possible, and it returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.
4. **Output Formatting**: The output format matches the required format, printing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.

Given these points, the program accurately solves the problem as described.
