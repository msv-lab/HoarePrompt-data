Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer `N` and a list of `N` positive integers `vals`. It calculates the product of all elements in `vals` and then computes a new list `vprod` where each element is the product of all elements in `vals` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. If the difference between the product and the sum of `vprod` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and exits. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string. The function does not return any value.**
