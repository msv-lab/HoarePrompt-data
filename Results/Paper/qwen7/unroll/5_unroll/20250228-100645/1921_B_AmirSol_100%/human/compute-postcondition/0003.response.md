Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 10^5), `s1` (a string of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'), and `s2` (a string of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'). It returns the maximum value between the count of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1' (cats_to_add), and the count of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' (cats_to_remove).**
