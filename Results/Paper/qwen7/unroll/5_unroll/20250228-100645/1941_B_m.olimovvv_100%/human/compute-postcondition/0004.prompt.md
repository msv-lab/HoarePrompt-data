You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \* 10^5. The array a consists of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each element a_j, and the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \* 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5. The array a consists of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each element a_j, and after executing the loop, if the conditions inside the loop are met for all elements, the last two elements of the array b are 0, otherwise, 'NO' is printed at some point during the loop execution. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes variables t (a positive integer), n (an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and an array a (consisting of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9). It returns a result based on the conditions provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
