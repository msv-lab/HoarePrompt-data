Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `_`, which is a placeholder typically used when the loop variable is not needed. However, the loop still requires an input to determine how many times it should run.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: Since the loop relies on user input (`int(input())`), the state before the loop starts must include the condition that ensures this input is valid. Specifically, the input must be a positive integer, as indicated by the problem statement.

3. **Consider the constraints**: The problem states that for each test case, `n` (the input) is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\). This means the input must fall within this range.

4. **Formulate the final state**: Given the above points, the state before the loop starts must ensure that the input is a positive integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer, and the input from `int(input())` must be a positive integer between 3 and \(2 \times 10^5\)**.
