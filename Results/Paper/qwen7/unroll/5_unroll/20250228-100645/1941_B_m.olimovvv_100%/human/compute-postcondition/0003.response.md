Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes variables t (a positive integer), n (an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and an array a (consisting of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9). It returns a result based on the conditions provided.**

This means the function is designed to work with external variables `t`, `n`, and `a` that are not passed as direct parameters to the function. It processes these variables according to certain conditions and returns a result.
