Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `_`, which is a placeholder typically used to indicate that the loop variable is not needed within the loop body.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer and is given to be in the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute as long as `t` is not zero.

3. **Adjust the States**: The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t`. Since the loop will run for `t` iterations, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the modified state is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list where each index `i` (1 ≤ `i` ≤ 200000) contains the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`, and `values[0]` is 0**
