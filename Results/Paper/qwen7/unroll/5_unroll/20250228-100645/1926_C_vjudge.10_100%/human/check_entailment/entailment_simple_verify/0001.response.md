### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of each integer from 1 to \( n \) and then summing these digit sums.

2. **Approach Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` initializes an array `values` where `values[i]` stores the sum of the digit sums from 1 to \( i \).
   - It iterates through each integer from 1 to \( 2 \times 10^5 \), calculates the sum of its digits, and updates the `values` array accordingly.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \) and prints `values[n]`, which gives the required sum.

3. **Time Complexity**:
   - The precomputation step runs in \( O(n \log n) \) because for each integer \( i \) up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \), we calculate the sum of its digits, which takes \( O(\log i) \) time.
   - The query step for each test case runs in \( O(1) \) since it just involves an array lookup.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The precomputation ensures that for any \( n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \), the sum of the digit sums can be quickly retrieved.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the digit sum calculation. The current implementation calculates the sum of digits for each integer from 1 to \( 2 \times 10^5 \) independently, which is unnecessary and inefficient. Instead, the sum of digits should be calculated incrementally as described in the problem statement.

5. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - The current implementation initializes `values` with zeros and then for each integer \( i \) from 1 to \( 2 \times 10^5 \), it calculates the sum of its digits and adds it to `values[i]`. This means that `values[i]` will contain the sum of the digit sums from 1 to \( i \), but this approach recalculates the sum of digits for each number from scratch, leading to redundant computations.
   - A more efficient approach would be to use the property that the sum of the digits of a number \( i \) can be derived from the sum of the digits of \( i-1 \) plus the sum of the digits of \( i \). This would avoid recalculating the sum of digits for each number individually.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution does not handle edge cases properly. For instance, if \( n \) is close to the upper limit of \( 2 \times 10^5 \), the current implementation may still perform unnecessary calculations.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it recalculates the sum of digits for each integer from 1 to \( 2 \times 10^5 \) independently, leading to redundant computations. The correct approach should use the incremental sum of digits property to avoid redundant calculations.

**Correctness: False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
