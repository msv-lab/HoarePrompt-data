Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1()` initializes a large list `values` of size `inf` (which is set to `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1`).
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   
2. **Precomputing Sums of Digits:**
   - A loop runs from `1` to `inf` (200001).
   - For each number `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits (`sum_value_digits`).
   - It updates the `values` list such that `values[i]` stores the cumulative sum of the sums of digits up to `i`.

3. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `value` and prints `values[value]`.
   - This means it directly uses the precomputed values to get the required sum without recalculating the sum of digits for each number individually.

### Issues and Correctness Check:

1. **Time Complexity:**
   - Precomputing the sums of digits for all numbers up to `2 * 10^5` takes O(n) time, which is efficient.
   - Querying the precomputed values for each test case takes O(1) time, which is also efficient.

2. **Space Complexity:**
   - The space complexity is O(n) due to the `values` array, which is acceptable given the constraints.

3. **Logic Verification:**
   - The logic of precomputing the cumulative sum of digit sums is correct.
   - The final output for each test case is derived correctly using the precomputed values.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` could be very large (up to `2 * 10^5`), and it efficiently computes the result using precomputation.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct according to the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
