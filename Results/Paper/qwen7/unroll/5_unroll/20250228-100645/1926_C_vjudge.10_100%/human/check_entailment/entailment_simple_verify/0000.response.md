### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem description step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
- For a given integer \( n \), replace each integer from 1 to \( n \) with the sum of its digits.
- Calculate the sum of these new numbers.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        print(values[value])
```

#### Annotated Code:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `inf` is set to 200001.
   - `t` is read from input, representing the number of test cases.
   - `values` is initialized as a list of zeros of length 200001.

2. **Precomputation:**
   - A loop runs from 1 to 200000.
   - For each integer `i`, the sum of its digits is computed and added to the previous sum stored in `values[i-1]`.
   - The result is stored in `values[i]`.

3. **Processing Test Cases:**
   - For each test case, `value` is read from input.
   - The corresponding value from the precomputed `values` array is printed.

#### Analysis:
- The program precomputes the sum of digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200000 and stores them in the `values` array.
- When processing each test case, it simply retrieves the precomputed value from the `values` array.
- This approach is efficient because it avoids recalculating the sum of digits for each number in each test case.

#### Example Verification:
- For \( n = 13 \):
  - Precomputed values:
    - `values[1] = 1`
    - `values[2] = 3`
    - `values[3] = 6`
    - `values[4] = 10`
    - `values[5] = 15`
    - `values[6] = 21`
    - `values[7] = 28`
    - `values[8] = 36`
    - `values[9] = 45`
    - `values[10] = 46` (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 1)
    - `values[11] = 48` (46 + 2)
    - `values[12] = 51` (48 + 3)
    - `values[13] = 55` (51 + 4)
  - The sum of the numbers on the board is indeed 55, which matches the precomputed value `values[13]`.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the problem description by precomputing the sum of digit sums for all numbers up to 200000 and efficiently retrieving the required values for each test case. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
