Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `inf` is 200001**.

The code initializes the variable `inf` with the value `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1`, which is `200001`. This value does not affect the values of `t` or `n`, so their initial conditions remain unchanged.
