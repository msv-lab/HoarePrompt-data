You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5; `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list where each index `i` (1 ≤ `i` ≤ 200000) contains the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`, and `values[0]` is 0.
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        
        print(values[value])
        
    #State: Output State: `values` is a list where each index `i` (1 ≤ `i` ≤ 200000) contains the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`, and `values[0]` is 0; `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; for each iteration of the loop, `value` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ `value` ≤ 200000, and the corresponding element in `values` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case involves two integers: t and n. For each test case, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. The function processes these values and returns different outputs based on the relationship between t and n.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
