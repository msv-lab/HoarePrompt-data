Reasoning:
1. The provided program aims to calculate the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n` and store these sums in a list.
2. It uses a precomputation approach where it calculates the cumulative sum of digit sums from 1 to each number up to `inf` (200001).
3. For each test case, it directly accesses the precomputed result for the given `n`, which is efficient given the constraints.
4. The program correctly handles multiple test cases as indicated by the execution summary.
5. The logic for calculating the sum of digits for each number from 1 to `inf` is implemented correctly within the loop.
6. The input and output handling is appropriate for the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program appears to be designed and implemented correctly according to the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
