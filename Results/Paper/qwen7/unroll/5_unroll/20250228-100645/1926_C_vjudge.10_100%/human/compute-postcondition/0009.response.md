Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case involves two integers: t and n. For each test case, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. The function processes these values and returns different outputs based on the relationship between t and n.**

This means the function is designed to handle a series of test cases, each containing two integers (t and n), and perform some operation or return a result based on their values, adhering to the specified constraints.
