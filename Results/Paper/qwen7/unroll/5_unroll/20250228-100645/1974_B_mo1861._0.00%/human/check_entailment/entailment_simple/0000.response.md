Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself.
3. The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string `b`:
   - It creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each unique character in `b` to a character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`.
   - This mapping ensures that the first character in the sorted unique characters of `b` is mapped to 'z', the second to 'y', and so on.
   - It then constructs the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.
4. The function returns the decoded string `s`.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotated program, the logic implemented in `func_1` correctly decodes the string `b` back to the original string `s`.

Correctness: **True**
