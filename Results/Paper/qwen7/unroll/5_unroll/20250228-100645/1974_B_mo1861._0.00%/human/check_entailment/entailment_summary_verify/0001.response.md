### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires decoding a string `b` back to the original string `s`. The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` with unique characters from `s` sorted alphabetically, and then replacing each character in `s` with its corresponding symmetric character from `r`.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to decode the string `b`.
   - It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted unique set of `b` is mapped to its symmetric character in `b`.
   - The mapping is done by calculating the position of each character in the sorted unique set and assigning it the corresponding symmetric character.
   - Finally, the function constructs the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value from `char_map`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The function correctly identifies the unique characters in `b` and sorts them.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the mapping logic. The function maps each character in the sorted unique set to a character in `b` based on the reverse order, but it does not account for the fact that the symmetric character should be the one at the corresponding position in the reversed sorted unique set, not the one at the position calculated from the length of `b`.

For example, consider the string `b = "serofedsoc"`. The unique characters sorted alphabetically are `cdefors`. The symmetric mapping should be:
- `c` -> `s`
- `d` -> `r`
- `e` -> `e`
- `f` -> `d`
- `o` -> `o`
- `r` -> `c`

However, the current implementation maps:
- `c` -> `s`
- `d` -> `r`
- `e` -> `e`
- `f` -> `d`
- `o` -> `o`
- `r` -> `c`

This is incorrect because the mapping should be based on the reverse sorted order of the unique characters, not the length of `b`.

### Correct Implementation:
To fix this, we need to map each character in the sorted unique set to the character at the corresponding position in the reversed sorted unique set. Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {c: unique_chars[-i-1] for i, c in enumerate(unique_chars)}
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    return s
```

With this corrected implementation, the function will correctly decode the string `b` to restore the original string `s`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was inaccurate due to the flawed mapping logic in the function `func_1`. The corrected implementation ensures that each character in the encoded string `b` is correctly mapped to its corresponding character in the original string `s`.
