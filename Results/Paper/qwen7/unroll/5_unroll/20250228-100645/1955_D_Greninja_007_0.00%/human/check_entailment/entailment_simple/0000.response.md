Reasoning:

1. The program correctly initializes the necessary variables and counters.
2. It calculates the initial number of matches between the first window of `a` and `b`.
3. It iterates through the array `a` using a sliding window approach to update the number of matches as the window slides over the array.
4. The logic inside the loop correctly updates the number of matches by removing the contribution of the element leaving the window and adding the contribution of the new element entering the window.
5. The final check after the loop ensures that any remaining window that meets the criteria is counted.
6. The function returns the correct count of good subarrays.

Given the above points, the program logic appears to be correct and should produce the expected results based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
