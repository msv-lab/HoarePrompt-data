N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of N strings, each string contains M characters. Each character in the string can be one of the following: '.', 'R0' to 'R9', 'B0' to 'B9', 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', or '.B'. The value of P is an integer such that 1 ≤ P ≤ 10. T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000.
