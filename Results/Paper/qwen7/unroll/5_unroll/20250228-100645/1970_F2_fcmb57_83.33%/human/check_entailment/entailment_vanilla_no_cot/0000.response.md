Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1` is not used correctly**: The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the main logic. Instead, the movement logic should directly update the player's position using `mouvements`.

2. **Bludger handling is incomplete**: The bludger is not handled properly. When a player is eliminated due to a bludger, the program should check if the player was carrying the Quaffle and handle the Quaffle accordingly.

3. **Player elimination logic is missing**: The program does not handle the elimination of players when they are hit by a bludger. Specifically, it should check if the player is carrying the Quaffle and update the Quaffle's position accordingly.

4. **Quaffle handling is inconsistent**: The Quaffle's position is updated inconsistently. For example, when a player throws the Quaffle, the Quaffle's position should be set to the player's current position, not an empty string.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        (x, y) = players[mo[0]]
        (dx, dy) = mouvements[mo[1]]
        new_x, new_y = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= new_x < m and 0 <= new_y < n:
            players[mo[0]] = (new_x, new_y)
            if mo[0] == '.B':
                for (k, v) in players.items():
                    if v == (new_x, new_y):
                        print(i, k, 'ELIMINATED')
                        if quidditch[1] == k:
                            quidditch = [v, '']
                        del players[k]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        quidditch[1] = ''
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            if mo[0][0] == 'R':
                quidditch[0] = middle
            else:
                quidditch[0] = players[mo[0]]
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            if mo[0][0] == 'B':
                quidditch[0] = middle
            else:
                quidditch[0] = players[mo[0]]
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles player movements, eliminations, and Quaffle scoring correctly.
