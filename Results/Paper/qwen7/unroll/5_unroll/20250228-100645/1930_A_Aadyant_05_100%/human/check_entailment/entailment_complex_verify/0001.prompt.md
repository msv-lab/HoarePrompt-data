You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        list2 = []
        a = input()
        list1 = []
        b = input()
        list1 = b.split()
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        list2.sort()
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    n = input()

    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        
        list2 = []

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `final` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being the sum of every first number in pairs from the input lists sorted in ascending order.
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
        
    #State: Output State: `final` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being the sum of every first number in pairs from the input lists sorted in ascending order, and the loop prints each element of the `final` list on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) and 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). For each test case, it sorts the input integers in ascending order, then sums the first number from each pair of consecutive numbers in the sorted list. The function returns a list containing the sum for each test case, with each sum printed on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `n` from the first input line.
   - It then reads a series of integers and stores them in `list2`.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle multiple test cases. It processes all test cases in a loop but does not reset variables between test cases.

2. **Sorting and Scoring:**
   - The program sorts the list of integers (`list2`).
   - It then iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, summing up the elements at even indices.
   - This approach aims to maximize the score by always picking the smallest available pair.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program reads all inputs for a single test case before moving to the next.
   - It should process each test case independently, resetting variables like `s` and `list2` for each new test case.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the score for each test case.
   - However, the way the program is structured, it might lead to incorrect results if the input handling is not properly managed.

### Correctness Check

Given the problem constraints and requirements, the program needs to handle multiple test cases correctly. Let's see if the current implementation meets these requirements:

- **Test Case Handling:** The program should read the number of test cases `t` first, and then process each test case separately.
- **Input Reading:** For each test case, it should read `n` and then read the `2n` integers.
- **Scoring Logic:** The scoring logic is correct, but it should be applied to each test case independently.

### Revised Program

Here is a revised version of the program that handles multiple test cases correctly:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    result = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        list2 = [int(data[index + i]) for i in range(2 * n)]
        index += 2 * n
        
        list2.sort()
        s = sum(list2[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))
        result.append(s)
    
    for r in result:
        print(r)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program has issues with handling multiple test cases correctly and resetting variables. The revised program addresses these issues and should work as expected.

**Correctness: False**

The original program would need significant modifications to handle multiple test cases correctly.
