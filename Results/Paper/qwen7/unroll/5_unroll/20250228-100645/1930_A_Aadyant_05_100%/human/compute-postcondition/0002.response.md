Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `num` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `num` is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - The variable `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.
3. **Initial State Before the Loop**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
   - `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
   - `final` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The value of `num` is not specified initially but will start from 0 in the first iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `final` is an empty list**
