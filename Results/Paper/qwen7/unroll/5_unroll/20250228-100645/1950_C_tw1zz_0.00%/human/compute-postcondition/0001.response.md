Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a time in the 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. For each input time in the 24-hour format "hh:mm", the code converts it to the equivalent 12-hour format with AM/PM notation and prints it. The specific times printed will depend on the inputs provided during the loop executions.
