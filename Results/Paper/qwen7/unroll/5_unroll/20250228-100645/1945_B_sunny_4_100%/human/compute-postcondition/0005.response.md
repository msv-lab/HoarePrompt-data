Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers a, b, and m within each test case, where 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. It returns a result based on the values of a, b, and m for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing three integers a, b, and m. The function processes these integers and returns a result for each test case without accepting these integers as direct parameters.
