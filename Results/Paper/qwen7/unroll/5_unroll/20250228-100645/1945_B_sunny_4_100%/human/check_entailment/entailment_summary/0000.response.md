Reasoning:
The given program attempts to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The formula used in the program is \( \text{ans} = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 2 \).

Let's break down the formula:
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor \) gives the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period of \(m+1\) minutes.
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor \) gives the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the same visibility period.
- Adding 2 accounts for the possibility of a firework being launched just before the start and just after the end of the visibility period, ensuring that the last firework is counted even if it starts exactly at \(m\) minutes.

This formula correctly accounts for the overlapping visibility periods of the fireworks from both installations. The program iterates through each test case and computes the result as expected.

Given the execution summary, the program processes each test case correctly, and the provided example outputs match the expected results. Therefore, the program logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
