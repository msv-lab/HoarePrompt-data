Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes values for t, n, and k within specified ranges (1 ≤ t ≤ 676, 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26). It returns a result based on these values.**

This means the function indirectly accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 676, inclusive, and `n` and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 26, inclusive. The function processes these values and returns a result accordingly.
