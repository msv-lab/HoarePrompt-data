Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether Nikita can obtain a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This ensures that the number of moves can be evenly split between adding and removing cubes, which is necessary to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Since the program handles all described cases correctly, the answer is "True".
