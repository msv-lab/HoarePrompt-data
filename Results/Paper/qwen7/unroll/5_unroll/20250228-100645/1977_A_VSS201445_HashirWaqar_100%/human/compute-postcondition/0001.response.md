Output State: The output state consists of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case based on the condition `if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0`. For each test case, if the condition is true, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The number of 'YES' and 'NO' outputs depends on the input values of `n` and `m` for each test case.
