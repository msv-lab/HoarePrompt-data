Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and for each test case, two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). It returns different outputs based on the values of n and m within each test case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing three integers: t, n, and m. For each test case, the function evaluates n and m and returns a specific output based on their values.
