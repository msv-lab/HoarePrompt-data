Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers: t, n, and m. For each test case, it checks if n is greater than or equal to m and if (n - m) is divisible by 2. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the specified condition.**
