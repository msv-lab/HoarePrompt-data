Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic used in the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
3. **Condition Check**: It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if `(n - m)` is even.
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it means there are enough moves to potentially achieve `m` cubes.
   - If `(n - m)` is even, it means the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even, which can be achieved by adding and removing cubes an appropriate number of times.

This logic aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
