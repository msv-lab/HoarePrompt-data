### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is a valid approach for handling multiple test cases efficiently.
   - It then splits the input into a list of strings and iterates over these strings to process each test case.

2. **Test Case Loop**:
   - For each test case, it correctly extracts the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities (`a`).
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculation of Next Year**:
   - The loop calculates the next year when the next sign will occur. This is done using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
     - This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.
   - This calculation is correct because it accounts for the fact that the tribe waits strictly after the previous sign has occurred.

4. **Appending Results**:
   - The result for each test case is appended to the `results` list as a string representation of the final year.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the results in the required format by joining the results list with newlines.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
