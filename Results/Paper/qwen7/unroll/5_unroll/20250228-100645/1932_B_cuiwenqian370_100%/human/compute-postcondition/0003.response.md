Output State: **`index` is 1, `T` is an integer from data at index 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value from the list `data` at index `index` to the variable `T`. Since `index` was initially 0, `T` now holds the integer value from `data[0]`. The value of `index` is incremented by 1 to point to the next element in the list. All other variables retain their initial states.
