Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and the input function is replaced with `sys.stdin.read`.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`, which means that instead of using the standard `input()` function, the program will now read all input from `sys.stdin` at once. This does not change the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It only affects how input is handled in subsequent parts of the program.
