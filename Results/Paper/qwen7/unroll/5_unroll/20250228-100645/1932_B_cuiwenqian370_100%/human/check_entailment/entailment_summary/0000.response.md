Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which all signs will occur sequentially according to the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all the input at once using `sys.stdin.read`, which is an efficient way to handle large inputs.
2. **Processing Test Cases**: It processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.
3. **Calculating the Year**: The program iterates through the periodicities and calculates the year when the next sign will occur based on the previous sign's occurrence year. This is done using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, which ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
4. **Storing Results**: It stores the final year for each test case in a list.
5. **Outputting Results**: Finally, it outputs the results for all test cases.

Given the explanation and the execution summary, the program correctly follows the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
