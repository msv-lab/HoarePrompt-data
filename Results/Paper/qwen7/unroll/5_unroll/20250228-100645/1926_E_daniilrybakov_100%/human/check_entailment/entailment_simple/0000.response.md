Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
3. The core logic of the program aims to determine the `k`-th card laid down by Vladislav. This is done through a loop where it calculates the number of cards laid down at each step (`x`) and updates the total count of cards laid down (`s`) and the multiplier (`m`).
4. The loop breaks when the current segment of cards (determined by `x`) includes the `k`-th card.
5. The formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m` is used to calculate the `k`-th card's value, which aligns with the problem statement.

Given the logical steps and the provided example outputs, the program appears to be correctly implementing the described algorithm.

Correctness: **True**
