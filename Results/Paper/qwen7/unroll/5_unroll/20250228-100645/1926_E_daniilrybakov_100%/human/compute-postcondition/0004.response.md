Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers `n` and `k` within specified ranges (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and returns a value based on these inputs.**

This means the function indirectly accepts `n` and `k` through some mechanism (not shown in the provided code snippet), where `n` and `k` are both positive integers with specific constraints, and returns a value determined by the relationship between `n` and `k`.
