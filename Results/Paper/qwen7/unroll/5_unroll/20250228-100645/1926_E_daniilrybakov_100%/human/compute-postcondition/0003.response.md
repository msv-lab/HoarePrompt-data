Output State: The value of `t` will be processed sequentially. For each `t`, the loop will compute a specific value based on the inputs `n` and `k`. The final output will be a series of computed values printed for each `t` from 1 to `t`. Each computed value is derived from the logic inside the loop, which essentially calculates a modified geometric progression based on the inputs `n` and `k`.
