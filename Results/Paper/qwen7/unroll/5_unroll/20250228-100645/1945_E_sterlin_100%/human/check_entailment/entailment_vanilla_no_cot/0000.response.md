To determine if the given program is correct, we need to check if it correctly implements the logic to find the required number `x` in the permutation `p` using at most 2 swaps to make the permutation suitable for binary search.

Let's analyze the solution step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, followed by the permutation `p`.

2. **Finding Positions**: For each test case, the program needs to find the positions of `x` in the permutation. If `x` is not in the permutation, it should find the closest numbers to `x` and swap them to make `x` appear at the correct position.

3. **Swapping Elements**: The program should perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that `p_l` equals `x` after the binary search.

4. **Binary Search Logic**: After performing the necessary swaps, the program should perform a binary search-like operation to find `x`.

Here is the corrected implementation of the program:

```python
import sys

def find_position(p, x):
    try:
        return p.index(x) + 1
    except ValueError:
        # Find the closest positions to x
        left = min(range(len(p)), key=lambda i: abs(p[i] - x))
        right = max(range(len(p)), key=lambda i: abs(p[i] - x))
        return left + 1, right + 1

def perform_swaps(p, x):
    pos_x = find_position(p, x)
    if pos_x == 1:
        return 0, []
    
    # Find the position to swap with x
    for i in range(1, len(p)):
        if p[i] == x:
            break
    
    # Perform swaps
    if pos_x > 1:
        if p[0] < x:
            # Swap x with the smallest element
            p[0], p[pos_x-1] = p[pos_x-1], p[0]
            return 1, [(1, pos_x)]
        else:
            # Swap x with the largest element
            p[0], p[pos_x-1] = p[pos_x-1], p[0]
            return 1, [(1, pos_x)]
    
    # If x is already at the start, find the next best position
    for i in range(1, len(p)):
        if p[i] != x:
            p[0], p[i] = p[i], p[0]
            return 1, [(1, i+1)]
    
    # If x is still not at the start, find the next best position
    for i in range(1, len(p)):
        if p[i] != x:
            p[0], p[i] = p[i], p[0]
            return 1, [(1, i+1)]
    
    # If x is still not at the start, find the next best position
    for i in range(1, len(p)):
        if p[i] != x:
            p[0], p[i] = p[i], p[0]
            return 1, [(1, i+1)]

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x = func_2()
        p = func_3()
        
        swaps, swap_indices = perform_swaps(p, x)
        print(swaps)
        for i, j in swap_indices:
            print(i, j)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Analysis:
1. **find_position**: This function finds the index of `x` in the permutation. If `x` is not found, it finds the closest positions.
2. **perform_swaps**: This function performs the necessary swaps to place `x` at the correct position.
3. **main**: This function handles the input and calls the `perform_swaps` function to get the required swaps.

Given the above analysis, the provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to find the required number `x` in the permutation using at most 2 swaps. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
