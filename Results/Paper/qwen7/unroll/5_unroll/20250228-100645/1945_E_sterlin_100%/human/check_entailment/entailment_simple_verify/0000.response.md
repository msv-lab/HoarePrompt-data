### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code correctly uses `func_1` to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - Inside the loop, it reads `n` and `x` using `func_2`, and the permutation `p` using `func_3`.

2. **Mapping Indices:**
   - The code creates a dictionary `num_indx` that maps each number in the permutation to its index. This is done using a dictionary comprehension where `num: indx + 1` is used to create the mapping.

3. **Binary Search Preparation:**
   - Two variables `left` and `right` are initialized to `0` and `n` respectively.
   - The code performs a binary search to find the position of `x` in the permutation.
   - During the binary search, the middle index `mid` is calculated as `left + (right - left) // 2`.
   - The value at `p[mid]` is checked against `x`. If `p[mid]` is less than or equal to `x`, `left` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, `right` is updated to `mid`.

4. **Finding the Correct Position:**
   - After the binary search loop, the code checks if `p[left]` is equal to `x`.
   - If `p[left]` is already `x`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
   - If `p[left]` is not `x`, it checks if `x` has been seen in the `seen` array. If `x` has not been seen, it prints `1` and performs one swap between `left` and the index of `x` in `num_indx`.
   - If `x` has been seen, it performs two swaps:
     - First, it finds the smallest index that hasn't been seen yet (`temp[0]`).
     - Then, it performs two swaps: one between `left` and `temp[0]`, and another between `temp[0]` and the index of `x` in `num_indx`.

5. **Output:**
   - The code outputs the number of swaps performed and the indices involved in the swaps.

Given the detailed analysis, the code correctly implements the logic to find the correct position of `x` in the permutation using at most two swaps. The binary search is performed correctly, and the necessary swaps are made to ensure `p[left]` is equal to `x`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was **inaccurate** because the provided code does indeed implement the required functionality. It correctly reads the input, performs the binary search, and makes the necessary swaps to ensure the desired result.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
