### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires rearranging a permutation `p` using at most two swaps so that the binary search finds the target value `x` at position `l`.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The given code attempts to perform a binary search on the permutation `p`. However, the code provided does not actually implement the binary search correctly. Instead, it uses a simple loop to find the position of `x` directly, which is not a binary search.

3. **Swapping Logic**: The code tries to find the correct position for `x` by checking if `p[mid]` is less than or equal to `x`. If not, it sets `right = mid`, which is incorrect for a binary search. Additionally, the logic for determining the correct swaps is flawed and does not guarantee that the correct position for `x` will be found.

4. **Function Definitions**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are not defined in the provided code. This suggests that the code is incomplete and does not match the problem description.

5. **Output Format**: The output format specified in the problem description is not followed correctly. The code prints the number of operations and the indices to be swapped, but the logic for determining these operations is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

Given the above points, the provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
