You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the current time step in the game. player is a dictionary mapping player identifiers (strings like 'R0', 'B0') to their current positions (a list of two integers [x, y]). blud is a list of players who are currently in the same position as a Bludger.
def func_2(t):
    out = []
    for p in player:
        if player[p] == blud:
            out.append(p)
            player[p] = [-1, -1]
        
    #State: Output State: `out` is a list containing all player identifiers (strings like 'R0', 'B0') that were in the same position as a Bludger (`blud`), `t` is an integer representing the current time step in the game, `player` is a dictionary mapping player identifiers to their new positions, where players who were in the same position as a Bludger are now mapped to `[-1, -1]`.
    for p in sorted(out):
        print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `out` will contain a list of player identifiers (strings like 'R0', 'B0') that were in the same position as a Bludger (`blud`) at each time step `t`, and these players will be printed with the message "ELIMINATED" along with the current time step `t`. The variable `t` will be incremented for each iteration of the loop, and the dictionary `player` will map the eliminated players to `[-1, -1]`. All players that were in the same position as a Bludger at any time step will be listed in `out` and printed as eliminated.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `t` (current time step), a dictionary `player` mapping player identifiers to their positions, and a list `blud` of players in the same position as a Bludger, and processes this information according to the game's rules at the specified time step.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
