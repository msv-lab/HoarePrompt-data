Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly initializes the field dimensions and reads the initial state of the field, including players, goals, and the Quaffle. It also correctly identifies the Bludger's position and stores player positions in a dictionary.

2. **Action Processing**:
   - The program processes each action step by step. It correctly handles movements, catching, and throwing of the Quaffle. The logic for updating the position of the Quaffle when it is thrown or caught is correct.
   - The program correctly updates the score when a player scores in the opponent's goal. The Quaffle is moved to the center of the field after scoring.

3. **Elimination Logic**:
   - The elimination logic in `func_2` is correct. It checks if a player is in the same position as the Bludger and eliminates them if so. The players are then marked as eliminated in the `player` dictionary.
   - The elimination messages are printed in the correct format and order.

4. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The final score is calculated correctly by counting the number of times each team scores.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the events in the correct order and format, including the final score.

Given that the program correctly handles all aspects of the problem, including initialization, action processing, elimination, and final score calculation, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
