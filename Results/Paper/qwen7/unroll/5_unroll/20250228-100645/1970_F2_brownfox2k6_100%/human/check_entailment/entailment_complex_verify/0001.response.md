### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly updates the position of an object based on the direction (`d`). It handles the four possible directions ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') appropriately by modifying the coordinates of the object.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function aims to identify and eliminate players who are in the same position as a Bludger.
   - It iterates over the `player` dictionary to find players that are in the same position as a Bludger.
   - It appends these players to the `out` list.
   - It prints the elimination message for each player in the `out` list, sorted alphabetically.
   - However, the function does not actually remove the players from the `player` dictionary. Instead, it sets their positions to `[-1, -1]`.

#### Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - The function correctly updates the position based on the direction.
  - The postconditions described in the annotation match the behavior of the function.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - The function correctly identifies players in the same position as a Bludger.
  - It prints the elimination messages for these players.
  - The annotation correctly describes the state transitions and the overall behavior of the function.

However, the original assessment correctly points out that the function does not remove the players from the `player` dictionary. Setting their positions to `[-1, -1]` might not be sufficient to ensure they are no longer considered active in the game. This could lead to incorrect behavior in the main program.

### Conclusion:

While the functions themselves are logically sound and correctly implement their intended behaviors, the original assessment is accurate in pointing out that the function `func_2` does not fully meet the requirement of removing players from the game. The current implementation might not ensure that these players are no longer considered active in the game, leading to potential issues.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
