You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5. The array c is a list of n positive integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. Each query is defined by two integers l_i and r_i such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is calculated as the cumulative count of 1s up to that index in `nums`, `sum` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is calculated as the cumulative sum of `nums` up to that index minus the index value.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is calculated as the cumulative count of 1s up to that index in `nums`, `sum` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is calculated as the cumulative sum of `nums` up to that index minus the index value, `q` is decremented after each iteration of the loop until it reaches 0, `l` and `r` are updated with values provided by user input for each iteration of the loop, `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` are recalculated based on the current values of `l` and `r` for each iteration, and the loop prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition for each iteration. After all iterations, `q` will be 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs including a positive integer t, lists n and q, an array c of n positive integers, and q queries defined by pairs of integers (l_i, r_i). For each query, it checks the range [l_i, r_i] within the array c and returns specific information based on the values within that range.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
