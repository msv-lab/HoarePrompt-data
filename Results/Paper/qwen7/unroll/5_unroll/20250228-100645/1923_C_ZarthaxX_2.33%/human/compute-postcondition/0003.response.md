Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0, `sum` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list named `sum` with `n + 1` elements, and each element in the list is set to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `nums`, and `ones`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
