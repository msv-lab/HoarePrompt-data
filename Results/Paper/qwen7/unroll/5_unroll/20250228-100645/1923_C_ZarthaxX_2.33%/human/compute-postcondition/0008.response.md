Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is calculated as the cumulative count of 1s up to that index in `nums`, `sum` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is calculated as the cumulative sum of `nums` up to that index minus the index value, after executing `q` queries, each query updates the values of `l` and `r` based on user input, calculates `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` for the given range `[l, r]`, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`. The variables `ones` and `sum` remain unchanged after the loop.
