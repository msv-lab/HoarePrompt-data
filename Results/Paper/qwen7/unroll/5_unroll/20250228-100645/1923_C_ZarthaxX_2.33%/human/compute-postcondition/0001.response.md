Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, and converts each element to an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `nums`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states.
