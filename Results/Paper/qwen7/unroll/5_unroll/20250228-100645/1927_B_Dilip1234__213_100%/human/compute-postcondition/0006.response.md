Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` represents the number of previous indices with the same character as the current index in the string. The function returns a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, where each letter appears a number of times equal to its corresponding value in `a`, and a list `char_count` of 26 integers where each integer is incremented by the count of its corresponding letter in `s`.**
