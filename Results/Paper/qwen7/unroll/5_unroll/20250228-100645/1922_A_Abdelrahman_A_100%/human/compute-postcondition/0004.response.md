Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, the function returns a specific value or message based on the given inputs.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer t, another integer n, and three strings a, b, and c. The function then performs some operation or checks based on these inputs and returns a result for each test case.
