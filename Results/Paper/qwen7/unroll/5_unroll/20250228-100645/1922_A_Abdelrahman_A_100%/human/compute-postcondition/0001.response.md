State: **`tests` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(tests):` will execute as long as `tests` is a positive integer.
2. The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `tests` must be greater than 0.
4. Initially, `i` should be set to 0 for the first iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `tests` (to ensure the loop can execute) and `i` (initial value for the first iteration).
