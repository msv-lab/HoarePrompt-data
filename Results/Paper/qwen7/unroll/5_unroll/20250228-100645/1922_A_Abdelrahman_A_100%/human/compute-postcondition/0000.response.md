Output State: **`tests` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `tests` ≤ 1000.**

The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tests`. This integer represents the number of test cases. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and the code only reads an integer from the input and assigns it to `tests`, the precondition that `t` is within the specified range is now transferred to `tests`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
