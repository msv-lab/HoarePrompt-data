Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (length of strings), and three strings a, b, and c (each of length n). For each test case, it checks if the string c contains any character not present in either a or b. If c contains such a character, it prints 'NO'. If c does not contain any such character, it further checks if c matches exactly with either a or b. If c matches exactly with either a or b, it prints 'NO'. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'YES'. The function outputs a series of 'YES' and 'NO' corresponding to each test case.**
