Output State: The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each test case, if `c` matches `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if each character in `c` exists in either `a` or `b` at the corresponding position; if any character in `c` does not exist in either `a` or `b` at the same position, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the inner loop, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
