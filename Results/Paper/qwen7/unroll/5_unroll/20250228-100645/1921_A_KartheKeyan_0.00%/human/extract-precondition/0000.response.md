Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases, each described by four lines containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates are integers within the range \([-1000, 1000]\), and it is guaranteed that these points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.**
