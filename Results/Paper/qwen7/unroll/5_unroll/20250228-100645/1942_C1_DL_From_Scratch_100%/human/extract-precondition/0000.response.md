Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are positive integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 ⋅ 10^5), and y = 0. The input also includes x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**
