Output State: The value of `count` is the sum of the occurrences where the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list (excluding the first `x-1` elements) is exactly 1, plus one additional count if the gap between the first and last element of the list, adjusted for the list size `n`, is also exactly 1. This calculation is performed for each of the `T` test cases, and the result for each test case is printed.
