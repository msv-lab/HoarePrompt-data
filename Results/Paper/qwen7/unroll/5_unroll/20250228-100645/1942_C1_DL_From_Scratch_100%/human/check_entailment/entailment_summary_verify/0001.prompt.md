You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads values for n, x, and y, along with x distinct integers from 1 to n. It then calculates the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive integers in the list, adjusts this count based on the value of x, and prints the result for each test case. The final output is the sum of these results for all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
   - The vertices are chosen by Bessie, and we can add up to `y` more vertices.
   - Since `y = 0`, we cannot add any additional vertices. Therefore, we only consider the vertices chosen by Bessie.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution sorts the chosen vertices (`list0`) and iterates through them to count the gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - For each gap, if the number of vertices between two chosen vertices is exactly one (i.e., `num == 1`), it means there is a potential to form a triangle.
   - The code counts such gaps and adds `x - 2` to the count, where `x` is the number of chosen vertices.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic seems to be counting the number of gaps where the number of vertices between two chosen vertices is exactly one.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not account for the fact that we need to form triangles using the chosen vertices and possibly the vertices at the start and end of the polygon.
   - The formula `count + x - 2` is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the number of triangles that can be formed.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To maximize the number of triangles, we should use the chosen vertices to form as many triangles as possible.
   - The correct approach would be to use the chosen vertices to form triangles, ensuring that the gaps between them are large enough to form triangles without intersections.

5. **Verification:**
   - The given solution does not correctly implement the logic to form triangles.
   - It incorrectly counts the number of gaps and adds a fixed value `x - 2`.

### Conclusion:
The given solution is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices.

### Correctness:
**False**
