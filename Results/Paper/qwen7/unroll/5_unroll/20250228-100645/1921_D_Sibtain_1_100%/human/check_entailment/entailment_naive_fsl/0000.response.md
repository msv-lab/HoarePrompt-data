Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not always maximize the total difference \(D\) as required. Specifically, the logic for assigning values from `c` to `a` to maximize the difference is flawed. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
4 6
1 2 3 4
8 7 5 8 2 10
```
- Expected Output: 23
- Actual Output: 15

The program sorts `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order, then tries to match elements from `c` to `a` to maximize the differences. However, this approach does not always yield the maximum possible difference. For instance, in the given example, the optimal assignment would be:
- Assign 10 to 1, 8 to 2, 7 to 3, and 5 to 4. This results in a total difference of \(|1-10| + |2-8| + |3-7| + |4-5| = 9 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 20\).

The program fails to consider all possible permutations of assignments to achieve the maximum difference. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.
