Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, m, a_i, and b_i. It validates t to ensure it is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100. For each test case, it checks if n and m satisfy the conditions 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5 and ensures the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. Additionally, it verifies that a_i and b_i are integers within the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9. The function then returns appropriate validation results for each test case.**
