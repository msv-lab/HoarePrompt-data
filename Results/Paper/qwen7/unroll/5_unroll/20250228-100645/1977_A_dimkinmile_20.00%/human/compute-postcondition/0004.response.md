Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `n` is less than `m`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('No')
```

This print statement will output the string `'No'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `m`.

Output: **'No'**
