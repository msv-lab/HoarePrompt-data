### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified the logical error in the program due to the unused function `func_1()`. However, the original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect because of this unused function, which is not entirely accurate. Let's break down the program again:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop that runs `kreker` times.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - A function `func_1()` is defined but not used within the main loop. This is indeed a mistake, but the function itself is logically correct.

3. **Test Case Processing:**
   - Inside the loop, the program calls `func_1()`, which is supposed to handle each test case.
   - `func_1()` correctly reads two integers `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. If true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Logic Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1()` is correct. After `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower can only be between `0` and `n` inclusive. Therefore, if `n >= m`, it is possible to have `m` cubes, and if `n < m`, it is not possible.

Given the function summary provided, the function `func_1()` is designed to correctly check the condition and print the appropriate response. The issue lies in the fact that `func_1()` is not being called inside the loop, but the logic within `func_1()` itself is correct.

Since the logic within `func_1()` is correct and the program would work correctly if `func_1()` were called inside the loop, the program is logically sound and meets the requirements of the problem.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
