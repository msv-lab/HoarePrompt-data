Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis
- **Objective**: Determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move involves adding or removing exactly one cube.
- **Key Points**:
  - If `n` (number of moves) is less than `m` (desired number of cubes), it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes because each move can only change the number of cubes by 1.
  - If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it is possible to achieve `m` cubes by adding cubes until `n` reaches `m` and then removing excess cubes if necessary.

### Code Analysis
- The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
- The function `func_1()` checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. If true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Function Summary
- The function processes a series of test cases.
- It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
- If true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".
- The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.

### Evaluation
- The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because it does not consider the nature of the operations (adding or removing one cube per move).
- However, the problem description and the function summary clearly indicate that the program is checking if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which aligns with the logic required to solve the problem.
- Given that each move changes the number of cubes by exactly 1, if `n` is less than `m`, it is indeed impossible to achieve `m` cubes. Conversely, if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it is possible to achieve `m` cubes through a combination of adding and removing cubes.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate. The provided code correctly implements the logic required to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Final: **True**
