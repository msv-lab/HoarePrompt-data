Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers, each representing the squared distance between two pairs of points. Specifically, for each iteration of the loop (from `i` in `range(a)`), the code calculates the vertical distance between two pairs of points and returns the square of this distance. If no valid pair of points is found based on the conditions given, the value of `res` will be `0`, and thus, the output will be `0**2 = 0`.

In natural language: The output state will be a list of numbers, where each number represents the squared vertical distance between two pairs of points, calculated for each iteration of the loop. If no valid pair is found, the output for that iteration will be `0`.
