Output State: **`prefix` is a list where each element is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to that point, starting with 0; `t` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged; `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing [0, 0]; `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing [0, 0].**

Explanation: The code initializes `suf` as a list of 32 lists, each containing `[0, 0]`. This does not affect the values of `prefix`, `t`, `n`, or `pre`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
