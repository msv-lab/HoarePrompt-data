Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `arr` is a list of elements.
   - `prefix` is a list where each element is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to that point, starting with 0.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

2. **Understanding `prefix`:**
   - The first element of `prefix` is 0 because it starts with the cumulative XOR of 0 elements.
   - The second element of `prefix` is the XOR of the first element of `arr` with 0.
   - The third element of `prefix` is the XOR of the first two elements of `arr` with 0.
   - And so on...

3. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(arr, prefix)` will print both `arr` and `prefix`.

Given this understanding, let's assume `arr` is a specific list to illustrate the calculation of `prefix`.

For example, if `arr = [a, b, c, d]`:
- `prefix` would be `[0, a, a ^ b, a ^ b ^ c, a ^ b ^ c ^ d]`.

So, the print statement would output:
- `arr = [a, b, c, d]`
- `prefix = [0, a, a ^ b, a ^ b ^ c, a ^ b ^ c ^ d]`

However, since the actual values of `arr` are not provided, we will describe the general form of the output.

Output: **[arr], [0, arr[0], arr[0] ^ arr[1], arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ arr[2], ..., arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[n-1]]**
