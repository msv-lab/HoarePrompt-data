Output State: `prefix` is a list where each element is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to that point, starting with 0; `t` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged; `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing [1, 0]; `suf` is a list of 32 lists, where each list contains the count of 1s and 0s in the binary representation of the cumulative XOR values from `prefix`. Specifically, for each index `j` in `suf`, `suf[j][1]` contains the total number of times the `j`-th bit (from the right) is 1 across all elements in `prefix`, and `suf[j][0]` contains the total number of times the `j`-th bit is 0.
