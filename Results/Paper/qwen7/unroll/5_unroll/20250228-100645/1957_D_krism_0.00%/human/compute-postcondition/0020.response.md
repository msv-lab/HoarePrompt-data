Output State: `prefix` is a list where each element is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to that point, starting with 0; `t` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged; `pre` is a 32x2 list where each `[j][0]` and `[j][1]` counts the number of 1s and 0s in the binary representation of the cumulative XOR values from `prefix`; `suf` is a 32x2 list where each `[j][0]` and `[j][1]` counts the number of 1s and 0s in the binary representation of the cumulative XOR values from `prefix` in reverse order; `ans` is the sum of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` for each bit position `k` from 0 to 31 after all iterations of the loop.
