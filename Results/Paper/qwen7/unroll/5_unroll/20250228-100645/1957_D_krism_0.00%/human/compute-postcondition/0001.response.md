Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, as no operation was performed on it. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) is still valid. The new variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input, which is guaranteed to be within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
