Output State: t is an integer representing the number of iterations in the loop, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 for each iteration, s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D" for each iteration, index is 1 + 2 * t, and the output consists of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration based on whether the count of 'U' in s is odd or even.
