### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly defines three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - `func_2` reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`.
   - `func_3` calculates a specific sum based on the input arrays `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program processes each test case separately.
   - It initializes variables and structures to keep track of the state of the items and their prices.
   - The program sorts the items based on Bob's price (`b_i`).
   - It uses a min-heap (`k_arr`) to keep track of the top `k` items based on Alice's price (`a_i`).
   - The logic correctly handles the scenario where Bob either takes all items for free (if Alice buys less than `k` items) or takes `k` items for free and pays for the rest.

3. **Optimization Process**:
   - The program iteratively updates the sum of Alice's profit by considering the optimal choices for both Alice and Bob.
   - It ensures that the sum of Alice's profit is maximized under the given constraints.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function seems to be incorrectly defined in the provided code. The function signature and purpose do not align with the usage in the main logic.
   - The function should be used to calculate the sum of the differences between `a_i` and `b_i` for the items that Alice keeps after Bob's action.
   - However, the current implementation of `func_3` does not match the expected behavior and should be revised.

### Conclusion:

Given the main logic and the handling of the input and output, the program appears to be correctly implementing the logic for calculating Alice's profit. However, there is a discrepancy in the definition of `func_3`, which should be corrected to properly calculate the sum of the differences between `a_i` and `b_i` for the items that Alice keeps.

Since the main logic is correct and the discrepancy is in the auxiliary function `func_3`, the overall correctness of the program is **False**.

### Correctness:
**False**
