Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves a strategic game between Alice and Bob where Alice selects items to buy, and Bob either takes some items for free or pays for them. The goal is to calculate Alice's optimal profit under the assumption that both players act optimally.
2. **Key Components**:
   - Alice wants to maximize her profit.
   - Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit.
   - Alice can buy any subset of items.
   - If Alice buys fewer than `k` items, Bob can take all of them for free.
   - Otherwise, Bob takes `k` items for free and pays for the remaining items at their respective `b_i` values.
3. **Analysis of Provided Code**:
   - **func_1()**: Reads the number of test cases.
   - **func_2()**: Reads and maps the input for each test case (number of items `n` and `k`, followed by arrays `a` and `b`).
   - **func_3()**: Calculates the sub_summ based on the logic provided in the problem statement.
   - The main code block processes each test case by sorting the items based on `b_i` and using a heap to manage the free items Bob might take.
   - The logic ensures that Alice maximizes her profit by considering the best combination of items to buy and sell, while Bob minimizes Alice's profit by taking the most beneficial items for himself.

Given the structure and logic of the code, it correctly implements the strategy for both Alice and Bob to achieve the optimal profit. The sorting and heap management ensure that Alice can make the best choices, and Bob's actions are also handled according to the rules specified.

Correctness: **True**
