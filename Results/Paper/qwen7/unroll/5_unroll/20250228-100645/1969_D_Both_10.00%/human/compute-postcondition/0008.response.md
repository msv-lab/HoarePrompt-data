Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `main_ar`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing prices for Alice and Bob, and `sec_arr`, a list of integers. It calculates and returns `sub_summ`, which is the sum of all elements in `sec_arr` where the sum of the second element of the corresponding tuple in `main_ar` is non-negative.**
