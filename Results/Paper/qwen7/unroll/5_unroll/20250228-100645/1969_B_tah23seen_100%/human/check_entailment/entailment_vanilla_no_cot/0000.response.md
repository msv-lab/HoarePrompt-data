Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The logic in `func_1` does not accurately reflect the minimum cost required for the operation. Specifically, the current implementation assumes that every '0' that appears after a '1' contributes to the cost as if it were part of a single cyclic shift operation, which is not always the case.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the positions of '1's and '0's and calculate the minimum cost based on the cycles required to bring all '1's to the front. The provided solution does not account for the optimal cyclic shifts needed to achieve the sorted order efficiently.
