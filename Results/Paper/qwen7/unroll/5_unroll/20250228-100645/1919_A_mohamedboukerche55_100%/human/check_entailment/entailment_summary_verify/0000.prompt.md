You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a number of test cases (`t`) from the user, followed by pairs of non-negative integers (`a` and `b`) for each test case. It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints 'Bob' if the sum is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules. According to the problem description, the winner is determined by whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd after all possible moves. However, the program simply checks if the initial sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and decides the winner based on that. This approach is incorrect because the game involves strategic exchanges between players, and the final outcome depends on the sequence of moves, not just the initial sum.

For example, consider the test case `1 4`:
- Initially, Alice has 1 coin and Bob has 4 coins.
- Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob, resulting in Alice having 4 coins and Bob having 1 coin.
- Bob can then choose to swap back, resulting in Alice having 1 coin and Bob having 4 coins.
- Both players can continue removing 1 coin from their wallets until one of them is left with 0 coins.

In this scenario, the final state of the wallets could be such that the sum of coins is even or odd depending on the sequence of moves, which the current program does not account for. Therefore, the program does not correctly determine the winner in all cases.
