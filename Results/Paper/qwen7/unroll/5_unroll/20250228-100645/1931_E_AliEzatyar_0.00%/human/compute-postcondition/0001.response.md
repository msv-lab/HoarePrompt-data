State: **`counter` is 0, `i` is len(num) - 1, `num` is a list**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `len(num) - 1`.
2. The loop will start if `i` is within the valid range of the `range` function, which means `i` should be greater than or equal to 0 (since the step is -1, the loop will decrement `i` until it reaches a value less than 0).
3. Initially, `i` is set to `len(num) - 1`, which is a valid starting point for the loop as long as `len(num)` is at least 1.
4. The variable `counter` is not directly involved in the loop condition and its initial value does not affect whether the loop will execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `num` is a non-empty list (i.e., `len(num)` is at least 1) and `i` is initialized to `len(num) - 1`.

State: **`counter` is 0, `i` is len(num) - 1, `num` is a list that must have at least 1 element**.
