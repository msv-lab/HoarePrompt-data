Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2⋅10^4.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, this condition is preserved. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
