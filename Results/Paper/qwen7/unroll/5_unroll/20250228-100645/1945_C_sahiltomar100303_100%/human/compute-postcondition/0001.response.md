State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2⋅10^4**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` as the condition for the loop to execute.
2. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
3. Given the constraint that `1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4`, we need to ensure that `t` falls within this range.
4. Therefore, the state of `t` must be adjusted to reflect that it must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2⋅10^4.

Hence, the state to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2⋅10^4.
