Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the optimal position for the road is exactly at `mid`. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the scenario where the road should be placed at the exact middle of the village, which is required by the problem statement. 

Consider the following test case:
```
n = 4
s = "1011"
```
In this case, the optimal position for the road is at house index 2 (since placing the road there would satisfy the conditions for both sides). However, the program incorrectly outputs 1 instead of 2. This is because the logic for determining the optimal position does not correctly handle the case where the road should be placed exactly at the middle.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly check for the middle position and ensure it is considered when determining the optimal position.
