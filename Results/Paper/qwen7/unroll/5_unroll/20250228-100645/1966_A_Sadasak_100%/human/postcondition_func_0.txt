The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k` (where 2 ≤ k ≤ 100). It returns a dictionary where each key is a unique number from the list `arr`, and the corresponding value is the maximum count of that number in the list, capped at `k`. If any number appears more than `k` times in the list, its count is set to `k`.
