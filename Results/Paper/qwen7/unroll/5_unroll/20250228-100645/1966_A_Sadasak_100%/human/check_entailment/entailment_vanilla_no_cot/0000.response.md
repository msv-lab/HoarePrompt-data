Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1` Function**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to reduce the frequency of each number to at most `k`, but it doesn't handle this correctly. It should keep reducing the count of each number until it reaches `k` or less.
   - Instead, the function simply updates the frequency table without ensuring that the frequency of any number does not exceed `k`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**:
   - The main logic in the loop does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards remaining. For example, if `k` is greater than `n`, the code incorrectly prints `n` instead of `1`.
   - The condition `if k in freq.values()` is flawed because it checks if any value in the frequency dictionary equals `k`, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to ensure that the frequency of each number is reduced to at most `k-1` (since we can exchange `k` cards for `k-1` new cards). We then count how many numbers have a frequency greater than `k-1` to determine the minimum number of cards left.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each number
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
    min_cards_left = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards_left += (count + k - 1) // k
    
    print(min_cards_left)
```

This approach ensures that we correctly reduce the frequency of each number to at most `k-1` and calculate the minimum number of cards left efficiently.
