Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `k` such that 2 <= k <= 100. It returns a dictionary where each key is a number from the list `arr` and its value is the maximum of the occurrences of that number up to `k`. If any number's occurrence exceeds `k`, it is capped at `k`.**
