Reasoning:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The problem requires finding an array of integers such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. However, the given code attempts to reduce `X` to 1 using specific operations (halving when even, decrementing when odd) and constructs an array based on these operations. This approach does not address the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the properties of increasing subsequences. One effective strategy is to use powers of 2 to construct the array because the number of increasing subsequences in an array consisting of distinct elements is \(2^n - 1\), where \(n\) is the number of elements. To get exactly `X` increasing subsequences, we can decompose `X - 1` into the sum of distinct powers of 2. Each power of 2 corresponds to a unique element in the array, and the presence of these elements ensures the desired number of increasing subsequences.

Given the above reasoning, the provided code does not match the problem requirements and thus is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
