You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    #State: Output State: t is the number of steps required to reduce x to 1 by either dividing it by 2 when it is even or decrementing it by 1 when it is odd. For each step, if x was even, max decreases by 1 and ans appends max; if x was odd, min increases by 1 and ans appends min. After the loop, ans is reversed and printed along with t.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it calculates the number of steps (`t`) required to reduce an integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) to 1 by either halving it when it is even or decrementing it by 1 when it is odd. During this process, it maintains two values, `max` and `min`, which are updated accordingly. After calculating `t`, it constructs a list `ans` containing these values and prints both `t` and `ans`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, `X`. The solution provided attempts to construct such an array using a binary-like approach where each element is either the maximum or minimum possible value within the specified range.

2. **Key Steps in the Provided Code**:
   - The code iterates over the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes variables `max` and `min` to represent the upper and lower bounds of the allowed values in the array.
   - It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the constructed array.
   - It uses a `while` loop to reduce `x` to 1 by repeatedly dividing it by 2 (if even) or decrementing it (if odd).
   - During this process, it appends either the maximum or minimum value to `ans` and adjusts `max` or `min` accordingly.
   - Finally, it reverses the list `ans` and prints its length followed by the elements.

3. **Analysis of the Logic**:
   - The logic aims to create a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`. This is achieved by constructing a sequence where each element is either the maximum or minimum value, effectively creating a binary-like structure.
   - The number of increasing subsequences in such a sequence can be calculated using combinatorial methods, which aligns with the goal of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The construction method ensures that the resulting array will have the desired number of increasing subsequences, as each choice between `max` and `min` contributes uniquely to the count.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the base case where `x` becomes 1 correctly by stopping the loop.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is initially 1, which would result in an empty array (length 0).

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The output format is correct, printing the length of the array followed by the array elements.
   - The constraints on the array length (at most 200) and element values ([-10^9, 10^9]) are respected.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Therefore, the given program is correct.
