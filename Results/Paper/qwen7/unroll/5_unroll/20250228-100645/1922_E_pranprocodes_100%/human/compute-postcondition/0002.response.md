Output State: t is the number of steps required to reduce x to 1 by either dividing it by 2 when it is even or decrementing it by 1 when it is odd. For each step, if x was even, max decreases by 1 and ans appends max; if x was odd, min increases by 1 and ans appends min. After the loop, ans is reversed and printed along with t.
