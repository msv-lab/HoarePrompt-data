### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in its conclusion that the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is correct based on the problem description. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step using the annotated code to ensure there are no discrepancies.

1. **Directory Scanning**:
   - The function starts by getting the current working directory using `os.getcwd()`.
   - It then scans the current directory for subdirectories using `os.scandir()` and filters them to include only those that are directories with names that are digits and fall within the specified range `[start, end]`.

2. **Folder Name Validation**:
   - For each subdirectory, it extracts the folder name using `os.path.basename(folder)` and checks if it is a digit.
   - It also ensures that the folder name is within the specified range using `int(folder_name)`.

3. **HTML File Detection**:
   - Within each valid folder, it lists all files ending with `.html` using `os.listdir(folder)`.

4. **File Generation**:
   - For each `.html` file found, it generates two new files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) within the same folder.
   - It creates these files using `open(ac_file, 'w').close()` and `open(wa_file, 'w').close()`, effectively creating empty files.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the number of `.html` files found in each valid folder.
   - It also prints the paths of the newly generated files.

Given the problem description, the function performs the following steps accurately:
- It correctly identifies subdirectories within the specified range.
- It correctly identifies `.html` files within those subdirectories.
- It correctly generates and prints the paths of the new files.

The annotated code provides clear evidence that the function behaves as intended, and there are no logical errors or inconsistencies noted.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is correct based on the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
