Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the `results` list.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element. This is because the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the `results` list has at least one element before the loop starts executing. The initial state mentions that `results` is a list of 'yes' and 'no' strings, but it doesn't specify the length or contents of the list.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the `results` list has at least one element.

**State:**
