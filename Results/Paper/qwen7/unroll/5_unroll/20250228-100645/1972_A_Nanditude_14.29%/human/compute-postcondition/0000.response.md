Output State: **The program returns a list of two lists, where the first list contains the difficulties (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) in descending order, and the second list contains the maximum expected difficulties (b_1, b_2, ..., b_n) in descending order.**

This means that the original list `arr` is sorted in descending order for both its sublists. The first sublist (difficulties) and the second sublist (maximum expected difficulties) are each sorted individually in descending order before being returned as a single list.
