The function `func_1` takes a list of two lists as input, where the first list contains non-decreasing integers representing the difficulties of problems, and the second list contains non-decreasing integers representing the maximum expected difficulties. After sorting both lists in descending order, it returns a new list of two lists with the difficulties and maximum expected difficulties sorted in descending order.
