You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of two lists, where the first list (arr[0]) contains n non-decreasing integers representing the difficulties of the initial problems (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), and the second list (arr[1]) contains n non-decreasing integers representing the maximum expected difficulties (b_1, b_2, ..., b_n).
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a list of two lists, where the first list contains the difficulties (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) in descending order, and the second list contains the maximum expected difficulties (b_1, b_2, ..., b_n) in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of two lists as input, where the first list contains non-decreasing integers representing the difficulties of problems, and the second list contains non-decreasing integers representing the maximum expected difficulties. After sorting both lists in descending order, it returns a new list of two lists with the difficulties and maximum expected difficulties sorted in descending order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have two arrays `a` and `b`, both of length `n`.
- Each element `a_i` in `a` represents the current difficulty of the i-th problem.
- Each element `b_i` in `b` represents the maximum allowed difficulty for the i-th problem.
- We need to find the minimum number of new problems (each with a difficulty `w`) that we need to add to `a` to ensure `a_i \leq b_i` for all `i`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is read from input, indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are read and initialized.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - `cnt` is initialized to count the number of new problems added.
   - Two pointers `i` and `j` are used to traverse arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - A while loop runs until either `i` or `j` reaches the end of their respective arrays.
   - Inside the loop:
     - If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means the current difficulty of the problem is higher than the expected difficulty.
       - A new problem with difficulty `b[j]` is added to `a` (by removing the last element and inserting `b[j]`).
       - `cnt` is incremented.
       - `j` is incremented to move to the next element in `b`.
     - Otherwise, `i` and `j` are both incremented to move to the next elements in `a` and `b`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function sorts the input array in descending order, which is not used in the main logic and seems irrelevant to solving the problem.

### Correctness Check:
- The logic correctly identifies when a new problem needs to be added.
- The insertion and sorting steps are handled appropriately.
- The loop ensures that all elements in `a` do not exceed their corresponding values in `b`.

### Example Verification:
- For the first example:
  - Initial `a = [1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200, 2700]`, `b = [800, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2200, 3000]`
  - After adding a problem with difficulty `800`, `a` becomes `[800, 1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200]`
  - After adding a problem with difficulty `1800`, `a` becomes `[800, 1000, 1400, 1800, 2000, 2000]`
  - The output is `2`, which matches the expected result.

- For the second example:
  - Initial `a = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, `b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
  - After adding problems with difficulties `1`, `2`, and `3`, `a` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
  - The output is `3`, which matches the expected result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.
