Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of new problems needed to ensure that `a_i â‰¤ b_i` for all `i`.
2. The program iterates through the arrays `a` and `b` simultaneously, comparing elements.
3. If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means the current problem in `a` is too difficult compared to its expected difficulty in `b`. In this case, the program removes the most difficult problem (`a[i]`) and inserts the expected difficulty (`b[j]`), then increments the count of new problems added.
4. The loop continues until either `a` or `b` is fully processed.
5. The program does not need the `func_1` function as defined because the main logic is correctly implemented within the main program.

Given the problem description and the example provided, the program logic matches the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
