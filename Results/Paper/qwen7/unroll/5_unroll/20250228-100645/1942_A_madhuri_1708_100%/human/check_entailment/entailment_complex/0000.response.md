Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the constraints and the format of the input and output as specified in the problem statement.
2. The logic within the function is as follows:
   - If `k >= 2`, it checks if `n == k`. If so, it prints `k` repeated `k` times. This ensures that all cyclic shifts will be sorted because every element will be the same.
   - If `n != k`, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `n != k` and `k >= 2`.
   - If `k < 2`, it prints a sequence of numbers from `1` to `n`. This ensures that exactly one cyclic shift (the original array) is sorted, which meets the requirement for `k = 1`.

Given the problem requirements and the logic implemented in the function, the program correctly outputs the appropriate results for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
