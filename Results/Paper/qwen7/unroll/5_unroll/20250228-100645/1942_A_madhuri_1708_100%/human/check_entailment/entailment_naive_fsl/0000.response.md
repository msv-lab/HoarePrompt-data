Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to generate arrays that meet the requirement of having exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k` is less than 2 and `n` is greater than `k`. 

For example, consider the test case `n = 3` and `k = 2`. According to the problem description, we need to find an array where exactly 2 out of the 3 cyclic shifts are sorted. However, the program only handles the case where `k >= 2` and either `n == k` or prints `-1` otherwise. It does not provide a solution for other valid cases where `k < n`.

A correct implementation would need to handle these additional cases. For instance, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, a valid solution could be `[1, 2, 3]` because the cyclic shifts `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 1]`, and `[3, 1, 2]` have exactly 2 sorted shifts (`[1, 2, 3]` and `[3, 1, 2]`). The current program does not generate such arrays and instead prints `-1` for this scenario.
