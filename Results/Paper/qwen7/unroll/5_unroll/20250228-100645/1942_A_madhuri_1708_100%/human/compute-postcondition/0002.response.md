Output State: The output will consist of lines where each line corresponds to a test case. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, and `n` is equal to `k`, the line will contain `k` occurrences of `k`. Otherwise, if `k` is less than 2 or `n` is not equal to `k`, the line will contain `-1`. If `k` is 1, the line will contain numbers from 1 to `n`.

For example, if there are two test cases with inputs:
1. `n = 3, k = 3`
2. `n = 4, k = 1`

The output will be:
```
3 3 3
1 2 3 4
```
