Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list `a` of non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters, and process them according to their values without needing to be called with these parameters explicitly.
