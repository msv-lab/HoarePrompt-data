State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is automatically initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
- The variable `t` is determined by the input, and it must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) for the loop to execute.
- No adjustments are needed for other variables or states since `n` and `a` are not involved in the loop head and their values are not provided yet.
