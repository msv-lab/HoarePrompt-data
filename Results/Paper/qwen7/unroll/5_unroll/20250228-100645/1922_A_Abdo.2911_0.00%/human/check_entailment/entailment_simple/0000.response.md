Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It constructs a template based on the characters of `a` and `b`:
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, it appends the character from `a` to the template.
   - If they are different, it appends the uppercase version of the character from `a` to the template.
4. It then checks if both `a` and `b` match the template:
   - For each character in the template, if it is lowercase, both `a` and `b` must match this character.
   - If the template character is uppercase, neither `a` nor `b` should match its lowercase version.
5. It also checks if `c` does not match the template:
   - For each character in the template, if it is lowercase, `c` must not match this character.
   - If the template character is uppercase, `c` should not match its lowercase version.
6. Based on these checks, it prints "YES" if `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not, and "NO" otherwise.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program appears to correctly follow the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
