### Reasoning:

1. **Template Construction**: The program constructs a template by comparing characters of `a` and `b`. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, it appends `a[i]` to the template. Otherwise, it appends `a[i].upper()` to the template. This part is correct because it ensures that both `a` and `b` match the template.

2. **Matching `a` and `b` with Template**: The program checks if both `a` and `b` match the constructed template. It iterates through each character and ensures that:
   - If the template character is lowercase, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` must match.
   - If the template character is uppercase, neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` should match the lowercase version of the template character.
   This logic is correct.

3. **Matching `c` with Template**: The program checks if `c` does not match the template. It iterates through each character and ensures that:
   - If the template character is lowercase, `c[i]` must not match.
   - If the template character is uppercase, `c[i]` should match the lowercase version of the template character.
   This logic is also correct.

4. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, and "NO" otherwise. This is correct based on the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
