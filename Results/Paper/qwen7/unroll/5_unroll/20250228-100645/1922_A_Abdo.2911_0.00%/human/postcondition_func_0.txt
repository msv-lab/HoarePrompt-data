The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads integers t and n, and strings a, b, and c. It constructs a template based on the comparison between strings a and b. Then, it checks if the template matches a and b but does not match c. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The final output consists of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.
