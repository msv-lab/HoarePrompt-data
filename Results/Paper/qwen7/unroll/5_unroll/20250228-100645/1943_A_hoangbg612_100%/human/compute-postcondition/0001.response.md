State: **`T` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10^4, _ is 0**.

Explanation:
- The variable `_` is a placeholder used in Python's `range()` function to iterate `T` times. It is automatically set to the current iteration value by the `range()` function.
- The variable `T` is given as an input integer that is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\). This means that for the loop to execute, `T` must meet this condition.
- Since the loop starts with `_` being 0 (the first iteration), no adjustment is needed for `_` itself.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should reflect that `T` must be within the specified range, and `_` is set to 0 for the first iteration.
