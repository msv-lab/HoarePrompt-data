You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = -1
        M = {}
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
            cur += 1
        cnt = []
        for k in M.keys():
            if M[k] == 1:
                cnt.append(k)
        if len(cnt) >= 2:
            cur = cnt[1]
        print(cur)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( T \) (number of test cases), a positive integer \( S \), and a list \( N \) of \( n \) non-negative integers. For each test case, it sorts the list \( N \) and then identifies the smallest number that appears exactly once or the second smallest number among those that appear exactly once, if such numbers exist. If no such number exists, it sets the result to -1. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the game logic and computes the MEX of the array `c` optimally.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Sorting:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `S` and the array `N`.
   - It sorts the array `N`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A variable `cur` is initialized to `-1`, which will keep track of the current smallest missing integer.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences of each integer in `N`.

3. **Processing the Sorted Array:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates the dictionary `M` and the variable `cur`:
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is more than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it updates the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.
     - If `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

4. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - If the sum of counts in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It creates a list `cnt` containing keys from `M` where the value is 1.
   - If there are at least two elements in `cnt`, it sets `cur` to the second element in `cnt`.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cur`.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Game Logic:**
  - The program aims to simulate the game where Alice and Bob pick elements from the array `a` and build the array `c` accordingly.
  - Alice picks any element, and Bob picks any remaining element, ensuring the game progresses optimally.

- **MEX Calculation:**
  - The program attempts to calculate the MEX of the array `c` by tracking the smallest missing integer.
  - However, the logic to update `cur` and handle the counts in `M` is flawed. Specifically:
    - The logic to increment `cur` and break out of the loop when `num > cur + 1` is incorrect.
    - The final MEX calculation is also incorrect because it doesn't properly handle the distribution of elements picked by Alice and Bob.

### Example Test Case Analysis

Let's consider the example test case:

```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

#### Case 1: `0 0 1 1`
- Sorted array: `[0, 0, 1, 1]`
- `cur` starts at `-1`.
- After processing, `cur` should be `2` (as explained in the problem statement).

#### Case 2: `0 1 2 3`
- Sorted array: `[0, 1, 2, 3]`
- `cur` starts at `-1`.
- After processing, `cur` should be `1`.

#### Case 3: `1 1`
- Sorted array: `[1, 1]`
- `cur` starts at `-1`.
- After processing, `cur` should be `0`.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to compute the MEX of the array `c` after the optimal game play. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
