You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers n, m, and k, along with additional integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. For each test case, it calculates a value s based on the number of edges (m), the modular inverse of half the number of possible edges (c), and a sum (a) of f_i values. The final value of s is computed using a specific formula and printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of children, the number of friend pairs, and the number of excursions, respectively.
   
2. **Calculating the Total Number of Possible Pairs:**
   - It calculates the total number of possible pairs of children using the formula \( \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \).
   - It computes the modular inverse of this value using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` where `M = 10^9 + 7`. This inverse will be used later in the calculations.

3. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - For each of the `m` pairs, it reads the indices `u`, `v`, and the friendship value `f`.
   - It accumulates the sum of these friendship values into the variable `a`.

4. **Calculating Expected Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - The program iterates `k` times to simulate the `k` excursions.
   - In each iteration, it updates the sum `s` using the formula `c * i * c * m + c * a`. Here, `c` is the modular inverse calculated earlier, and `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`.
   - Finally, it prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` is not correctly representing the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
   - The expected value should consider the probability of picking a specific pair in each excursion and how the friendship value changes over time.
   - The current implementation does not account for the changing friendship values correctly.

2. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The use of modular arithmetic is correct, but the logic for calculating the expected value needs to be revised.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly calculate the expected value, we need to consider the following:

1. **Probability of Picking a Pair:**
   - Each pair has an equal probability of being picked in each excursion.
   - The probability of picking a specific pair in any excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

2. **Expected Increase in Friendship Value:**
   - If a pair is picked, its friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent picks.
   - The expected increase in the sum of friendship values can be calculated using the properties of expectation and linearity.

Given the complexity, a correct solution would involve more detailed probabilistic analysis and summation of expected values.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
