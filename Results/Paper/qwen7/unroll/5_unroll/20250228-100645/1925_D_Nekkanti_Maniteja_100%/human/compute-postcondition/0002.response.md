Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Additionally, c is an integer calculated as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), s is an integer initially set to 0, and a is an integer initially set to 0. After the loop executes all the iterations, s is updated based on the formula \( s = s + c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a \) for each iteration from 0 to k-1, and then printed as \( s \mod (10^9 + 7) \).
