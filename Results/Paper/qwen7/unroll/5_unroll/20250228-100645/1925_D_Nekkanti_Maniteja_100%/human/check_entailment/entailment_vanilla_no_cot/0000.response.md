Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Calculation of Expected Value**: The program attempts to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values but does not correctly account for the probability of picking each pair during the excursions. The formula used in the program does not accurately reflect the expected value calculation.

2. **Friendship Value Update**: The program incorrectly updates the friendship value. It should consider the probability of picking a specific pair and how the friendship value changes over the excursions. The current implementation does not properly handle these probabilities and updates.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**: While the program uses modular arithmetic with \(10^9 + 7\), it does not correctly apply the necessary calculations to find the expected value.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to use the concept of linearity of expectation. For each pair of friends, calculate the expected increase in their friendship value over \(k\) excursions. The expected value for each pair can be calculated as follows:

- The probability of picking any specific pair in one excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
- The expected number of times a specific pair is picked in \(k\) excursions is \(k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
- The expected increase in friendship value for a pair of friends over \(k\) excursions is \(k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

Summing up the expected values for all pairs will give the total expected value of the sum of friendship values.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        binom_inv = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, MOD)
        
        total_value = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            total_value += f
        
        expected_value = k * binom_inv * total_value % MOD
        print(expected_value)

func()
```

This corrected program correctly calculates the expected value using the linearity of expectation and modular arithmetic.
