The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers n, m, and k, along with additional integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. For each test case, it calculates a value s based on the number of edges (m), the modular inverse of half the number of possible edges (c), and a sum (a) of f_i values. The final value of s is computed using a specific formula and printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
