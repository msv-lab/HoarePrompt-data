Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of children, the number of friend pairs, and the number of excursions, respectively.
   
2. **Calculating the Total Number of Possible Pairs:**
   - It calculates the total number of possible pairs of children using the formula \( \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \).
   - It computes the modular inverse of this value using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` where `M = 10^9 + 7`. This inverse will be used later in the calculations.

3. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - For each of the `m` pairs, it reads the indices `u`, `v`, and the friendship value `f`.
   - It accumulates the sum of these friendship values into the variable `a`.

4. **Calculating Expected Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - The program iterates `k` times to simulate the `k` excursions.
   - In each iteration, it updates the sum `s` using the formula `c * i * c * m + c * a`. Here, `c` is the modular inverse calculated earlier, and `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`.
   - Finally, it prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` is not correctly representing the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
   - The expected value should consider the probability of picking a specific pair in each excursion and how the friendship value changes over time.
   - The current implementation does not account for the changing friendship values correctly.

2. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The use of modular arithmetic is correct, but the logic for calculating the expected value needs to be revised.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly calculate the expected value, we need to consider the following:

1. **Probability of Picking a Pair:**
   - Each pair has an equal probability of being picked in each excursion.
   - The probability of picking a specific pair in any excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

2. **Expected Increase in Friendship Value:**
   - If a pair is picked, its friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent picks.
   - The expected increase in the sum of friendship values can be calculated using the properties of expectation and linearity.

Given the complexity, a correct solution would involve more detailed probabilistic analysis and summation of expected values.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
