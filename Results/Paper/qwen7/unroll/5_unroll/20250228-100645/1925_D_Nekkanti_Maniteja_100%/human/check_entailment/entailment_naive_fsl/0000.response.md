Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program does not account for the probability of choosing each pair during the excursions.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Probability**: The program calculates the inverse of the total number of pairs (`c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`), but it does not correctly use this probability in the calculation of the expected value. The probability of choosing a specific pair in each excursion should be considered, and the expected value should be calculated accordingly.

2. **Incorrect Summation of Friendship Values**: The program sums the initial friendship values (`a`) but does not correctly incorporate the probability of choosing each pair in each excursion. The expected value should take into account the probability of choosing each pair and the increase in friendship value over subsequent excursions.

3. **Lack of Proper Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value should be calculated using the formula for the expected value of a random variable. In this case, the expected value for each pair should be the sum of the probabilities of choosing each pair multiplied by their respective friendship values increased by the number of times they are chosen.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
