Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which are the number of children, the number of friend pairs, and the number of excursions, respectively.
   - The variable `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\), which is used for modular arithmetic.

2. **Modular Inverse Calculation**:
   - The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is done using the expression `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`. This step is correct because it ensures that `c` is the multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) under modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Sum Initialization**:
   - The variables `s` and `a` are initialized to 0. `s` will store the sum of friendship values, and `a` will store the sum of initial friendship values of all pairs.

4. **Friendship Value Sum Calculation**:
   - The program correctly sums up the initial friendship values of all given pairs in the loop `for i in range(m):`. This is done by adding the friendship value `f` of each pair `(u, v)` to `a`.

5. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value calculation is incorrect. The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is not appropriate for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
   - The correct approach would involve calculating the probability of choosing each pair and updating the expected value accordingly. The given formula does not reflect this probability-based update.

6. **Output**:
   - The result is printed as `s % M`, which is correct for ensuring the output is within the required modulo.

Given the above points, the program incorrectly calculates the expected value due to the inappropriate use of the formula. The correct approach should involve calculating the probability of choosing each pair and updating the expected value accordingly.

Correctness: **False**
