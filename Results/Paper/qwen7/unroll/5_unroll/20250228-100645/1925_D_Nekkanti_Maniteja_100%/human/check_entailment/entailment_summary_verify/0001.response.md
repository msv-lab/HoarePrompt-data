### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and provide a more detailed analysis:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` is indeed incorrect. This formula does not properly account for the expected increase in friendship values over the excursions.
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values should consider the probability of picking each pair and how the friendship values change over time.

2. **Probabilistic Analysis:**
   - Each pair has an equal probability of being picked in each excursion. The probability of picking a specific pair in any excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - If a pair is picked, its friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent picks. The expected increase in the sum of friendship values can be calculated using the properties of expectation and linearity.

3. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The use of modular arithmetic is correct, but the logic for calculating the expected value needs to be revised.

Given the complexity, a correct solution would involve more detailed probabilistic analysis and summation of expected values. Specifically, the expected value for each pair should be calculated based on the probability of being picked and the increase in friendship value.

### Correct Approach:

1. **Calculate the Probability of Picking Each Pair:**
   - The probability of picking any specific pair in a single excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

2. **Expected Increase in Friendship Value:**
   - If a pair is picked, its friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent picks. The expected increase in the sum of friendship values for a specific pair can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Expected Increase} = \left(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \left(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\right)\right) \times \text{Friendship Value}
     \]
   - Here, \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) represents the total number of times the pair can be picked in \( k \) excursions.

3. **Summing Up the Expected Values:**
   - Sum the expected increases for all pairs to get the total expected sum of friendship values.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness:** False

Final: **False**
