### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and provide a more detailed explanation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` does not accurately represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The expected value should take into account the probability of picking a specific pair and how the friendship value changes over time.
   - Specifically, the expected value for each pair should be calculated based on the probability of picking the pair and the cumulative effect of increasing the friendship value.

2. **Probabilistic Analysis:**
   - The probability of picking a specific pair in each excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - If a pair is picked, its friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent picks. This means that the expected increase in the sum of friendship values should be calculated considering the number of times each pair is picked and the cumulative effect of the increases.

3. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The use of modular arithmetic is correct, but the logic for calculating the expected value needs to be revised to reflect the correct probabilistic behavior.

Given the complexity, a correct approach would involve:
- Calculating the expected value for each pair based on the probability of being picked and the cumulative effect of the increases.
- Summing these expected values for all pairs to get the overall expected sum.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Probability of Picking a Pair:**
   - The probability of picking a specific pair in any single excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - Over `k` excursions, the expected number of times a specific pair is picked is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

2. **Expected Increase in Friendship Value:**
   - If a pair is picked, its friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent picks. Therefore, the expected increase in the friendship value of a pair after `k` excursions is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - The expected contribution of a pair with friendship value `f` to the total sum is \( f \cdot \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

3. **Summing Expected Values:**
   - The total expected sum of friendship values is the sum of the expected contributions of all pairs.
   - This can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Expected Sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \cdot \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     \text{Expected Sum} = \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i
     \]

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The result should be taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Conclusion:

The original program does not correctly implement the logic to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The provided solution does not account for the probabilistic behavior and the cumulative effect of the increases in friendship values.

**Final: False**
