Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Additionally, c is an integer calculated as (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** -1 % (10 ** 9 + 7), a is an integer calculated as the sum of f_i for all edges, and s is an integer calculated as the sum of c * i * c * m + c * a for all iterations from 0 to k-1, all taken modulo (10 ** 9 + 7).
