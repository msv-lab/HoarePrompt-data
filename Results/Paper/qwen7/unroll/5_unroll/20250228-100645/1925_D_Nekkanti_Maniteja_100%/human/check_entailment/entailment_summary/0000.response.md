Reasoning:

1. **Input Processing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case, reading `n`, `m`, and `k` for each.
2. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the number of possible edge pairs in a complete graph with `n` vertices, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\). This is done using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` where `M = 10^9 + 7`. This is correct.
3. **Sum of Friendship Values**: The variable `a` accumulates the sum of all `f_i` values from the input for each test case. This is also correct.
4. **Calculation of Expected Value**: The program calculates `s` using the formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each of the `k` excursions. However, the formula seems to be incorrect based on the problem statement. The expected value of the sum of friendship values should consider the probability of picking each pair and how the friendship values change over excursions.
5. **Final Output**: The result is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the problem statement, the correct approach would involve calculating the expected increase in friendship values for each excursion. The current implementation does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation as described in the problem.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
