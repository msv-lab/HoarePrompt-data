Output State: **ntest is an input integer, 1 ≤ ntest ≤ 500.**

The code `ntest = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `ntest`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`, and `ntest` is now assigned the value of this integer, the new state for `ntest` is that it is an input integer within the same range. All other variables remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
