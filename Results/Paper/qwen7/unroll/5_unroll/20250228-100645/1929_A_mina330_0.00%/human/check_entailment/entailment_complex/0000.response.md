Reasoning:
The given program aims to calculate the maximum beauty of an array by sorting it and then summing the differences between pairs of elements that are symmetrically placed around the center of the sorted array. This approach is correct because:

1. **Sorting the Array**: By sorting the array, we ensure that the smallest elements are at the beginning and the largest elements are at the end.
2. **Summing Differences**: The expression `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` correctly computes the difference between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on. This maximizes the beauty since the largest values are paired with the smallest values.

Given the problem statement and the example provided, the program logic matches the requirement to maximize the beauty of the array. The program processes each test case independently and outputs the correct result for each case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
