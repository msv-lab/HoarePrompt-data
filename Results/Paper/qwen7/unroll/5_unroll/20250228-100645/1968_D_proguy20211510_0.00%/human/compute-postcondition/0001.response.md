Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each testcase, n, k, P_B, P_S are integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; p is a permutation of length n; a is an array of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; YES, NO = 'YES', 'NO'**.

Explanation: The code sets the value of `MOD` to `10 ** 9 + 7`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `YES`, or `NO`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions except for the assignment of `MOD`.
