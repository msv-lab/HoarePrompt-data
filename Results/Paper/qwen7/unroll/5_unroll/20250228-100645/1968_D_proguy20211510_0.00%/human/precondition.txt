t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each testcase, n, k, P_B, P_S are integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; p is a list of n integers representing the permutation p_1, \dots, p_n such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n; a is a list of n integers representing the array a_1, \dots, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
