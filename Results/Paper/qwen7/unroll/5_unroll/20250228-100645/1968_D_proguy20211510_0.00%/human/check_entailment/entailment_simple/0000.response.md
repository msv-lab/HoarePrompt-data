Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Scores**: The program attempts to calculate scores using a fixed maximum value (`maxa`) instead of considering the actual sequence of moves and scores for each player. This approach fails to account for the dynamic changes in positions and scores over the course of the game.

2. **Logic Flaws**: The program incorrectly assumes that the maximum value in the array `a` determines the outcome of the game. This is not always true, as the sequence of moves and the resulting scores must be considered.

3. **Incomplete Implementation**: The program does not fully implement the logic to simulate the game for each turn and calculate the final scores accurately. It only handles some edge cases (where both players start at the position with the maximum value in `a`) and does not cover the general case where players take different paths through the permutation.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
