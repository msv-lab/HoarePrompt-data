Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for char in password:`. The objects involved here are `char`, `password`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `password` is a string of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - `digits` is an empty list.
   - `letters` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop will iterate over each character in the `password` string.
   - On the first iteration, `char` will be the first character of `password`.

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - Since the loop depends on the characters in `password`, we need to ensure that `password` is not empty. If `password` were empty, the loop would not execute.
   - `char` will be set to the first character of `password` during the first iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `password` should not be empty (it must have at least one character).
- `char` should be the first character of `password`.

Given this, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`password` is a non-empty string of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the first character of `password`**.
