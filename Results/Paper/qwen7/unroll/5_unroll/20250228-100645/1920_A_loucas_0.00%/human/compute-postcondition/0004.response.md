Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. The list includes at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.**
