Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used in the range function.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - The loop will iterate based on the value of `int(input())`.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since the loop will iterate based on the input value, the initial state of the loop must ensure that the input value is within the valid range for `t`.
   - Therefore, the input value must be between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value itself, ensuring it falls within the specified range.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the input value must be within the same range (1 to \(10^4\))**.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the input value must be within the same range (1 to \(10^4\))**.
