Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing an array `a` such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \leq i \leq n`.
2. The proposed solution initializes `a[0]` to 500 and then sets each subsequent element `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. This approach does not necessarily satisfy the required condition `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`.
3. For instance, consider the example given in the problem statement:
   - Test case: `n = 4`, `x = [2, 4, 1]`
   - The proposed solution would set `a = [500, 502, 506, 507]`.
   - However, this does not satisfy the condition:
     - `502 % 500 != 2`
     - `506 % 502 != 4`
     - `507 % 506 != 1`

Given these points, the proposed solution does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \leq i \leq n`.

Correctness: **False**
