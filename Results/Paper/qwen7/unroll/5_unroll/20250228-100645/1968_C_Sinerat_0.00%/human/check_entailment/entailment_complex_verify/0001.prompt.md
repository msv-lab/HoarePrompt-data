You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 500
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [0] * n
        
        a[0] = 500
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        
        print(*a)
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n. After executing the loop, a is a list of n integers where a[0] = 500 and a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1] for all 1 ≤ i < n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( t \), and a list \( x \) of \( n-1 \) integers. It then calculates a list \( a \) of length \( n \) where \( a[0] = 500 \) and \( a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1] \) for \( 1 \leq i < n \). Finally, it prints the list \( a \) for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the solution for the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list `x`.

2. **Array Initialization:**
   - An array `a` of size `n` is initialized with zeros.
   - The first element `a[0]` is set to 500.

3. **Filling the Array:**
   - For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`), the program sets `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the array `a`.

### Checking the Solution Against the Problem Statement

The problem requires finding an array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that:
- \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\).
- \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).

#### Verification of the Approach

1. **Initial Value:**
   - Setting `a[0] = 500` is arbitrary but within the allowed range.

2. **Filling the Array:**
   - The approach `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]` ensures that `a[i]` is greater than `a[i-1]` and thus `a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` will always be less than `a_{i-1}`.
   - However, this does not guarantee that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\). The chosen values might not satisfy the condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\).

3. **Example Verification:**
   - Consider the first example: \(x = [2, 4, 1]\).
     - If we follow the program, `a` would be `[500, 502, 506]`.
     - Check the condition:
       - \(502 \bmod 500 = 2\) (correct)
       - \(506 \bmod 502 = 4\) (correct)
       - But \(506 \bmod 502 \neq 1\) (incorrect)

### Conclusion

The provided program does not guarantee that the generated array `a` will satisfy the condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\). Therefore, the solution is not correct.
