Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not satisfy the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the value of \(a_i\) should be within the range \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\), but the current implementation sets \(a_0 = 500\) and then increments each subsequent \(a_i\) by \(x_{i-1}\). This approach can lead to values of \(a_i\) that exceed \(10^9\), which is not allowed.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 4 1
```
The program will generate:
```
500 502 506
```
Here, \(506 > 10^9\), which violates the condition \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\).

A correct solution would need to ensure that each \(a_i\) remains within the specified range. One possible approach could be to set \(a_1\) to a value that ensures all subsequent values stay within bounds, such as setting \(a_1 = 1\) and adjusting the logic accordingly.
