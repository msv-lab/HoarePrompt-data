Output State: **`a` is assigned to `x`, `b` is assigned to `y`, `dx` is `b`, and `dy` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code `dx, dy = b` attempts to unpack the value of `b` into two variables `dx` and `dy`. However, since `b` is a single value (an integer), it can only assign this value to one of the variables. Typically, the first variable (`dx`) would receive the value of `b`, and the second variable (`dy`) would be left undefined. The initial values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
