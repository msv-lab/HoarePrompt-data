Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the field.
   - It initializes dictionaries to store the positions of players and goals.
   - It correctly identifies and stores the positions of goals and players.

2. **Movement Handling**:
   - The program correctly updates the positions of players based on the movement commands.
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle the movement of players, updating their positions correctly.

3. **Scoring Logic**:
   - The program checks if a player has moved to a goal belonging to the opposing team and updates the score accordingly.
   - It prints the appropriate message when a team scores.
   - After processing all moves, it prints the final score.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where a player scores in the wrong goal by correctly identifying the scoring team.
   - The movements are validated within the field boundaries, ensuring that players do not move out of the field.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the events in the correct format, including the score at the end of the game.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
