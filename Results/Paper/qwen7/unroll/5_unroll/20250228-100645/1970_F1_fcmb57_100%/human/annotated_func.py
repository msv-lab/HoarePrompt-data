#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field, respectively, where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd. The field is represented as a list of strings, each string containing M characters, and each character can be one of the following: '.', 'R0' to 'R9', 'B0' to 'B9', 'RG', 'BG', or '.Q'. Additionally, the function takes a list of actions, where each action is a string describing the entity performing the action and the action itself (e.g., 'B2 U' for a blue player with number 2 moving up).
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns x which is assigned to a and dx which is b, and y which is assigned to b and dy which is undefined
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two tuples `a` and `b`, each containing two integers. It returns four values: `x` and `y` are new variables assigned the first and second elements of `a` respectively, while `dx` is assigned the first element of `b` and `dy` remains undefined.
