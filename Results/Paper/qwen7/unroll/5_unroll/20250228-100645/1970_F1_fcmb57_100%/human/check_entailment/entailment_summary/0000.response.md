Reasoning:
- The function `func_1` is intended to update the coordinates of a player based on the movement direction provided.
- The function correctly unpacks the tuple `a` into `x` and `y`, which represent the current coordinates of the player.
- The function correctly unpacks the tuple `b` into `dx` and `dy`, which represent the change in coordinates due to the movement direction.
- However, the function assigns `dy` to an undefined variable, which should not cause an error but is unnecessary and could be simplified.

Given the provided code and the execution summary, the function `func_1` is not used in the main logic of the program. Instead, the player's coordinates are updated directly using the `mouvements` dictionary. Therefore, the function `func_1` is redundant and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.

However, since the function is not causing any runtime errors and the rest of the logic appears to handle the movements and scoring correctly based on the examples provided, we can conclude that the program is correct in terms of functionality.

Correctness: **True**
