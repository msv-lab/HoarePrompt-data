### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated code and the problem description step-by-step to verify the correctness of the provided solution.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
- For each outcome \( i \), if it wins, we receive \( k_i \times \text{bet}_i \) coins.
- The goal is to find a distribution of bets \( \text{bet}_1, \text{bet}_2, \ldots, \text{bet}_n \) such that \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{bet}_i < k_i \times \text{bet}_i \) for all \( i \).

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers \( a \) and \( b \).
   - It uses the formula: \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \).
   - This function is not directly relevant to solving the problem since it does not help in determining the distribution of bets.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function computes the LCM of a list of numbers.
   - It iteratively applies `func_1` to compute the LCM of the entire list.
   - Again, this function is not relevant to the problem because it does not help in determining the distribution of bets.

3. **Main Code Logic**:
   - The main logic reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \( n \) and the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).
   - It then computes the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`.
   - It divides the LCM by each multiplier to get a set of bets.
   - If the sum of these bets is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets.

#### Evaluation:
- The core issue with the provided code is that it does not correctly determine the distribution of bets. Instead, it computes the LCM of the multipliers and then divides this LCM by each multiplier to get the bets. This approach does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
- The expected output for the given example test case should be a valid distribution of bets, but the provided code does not generate such a distribution.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not solve the problem as described.

### Final:
**False**
