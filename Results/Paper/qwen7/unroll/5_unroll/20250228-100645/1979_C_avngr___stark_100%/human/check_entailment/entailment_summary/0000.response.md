Reasoning:
- The problem requires distributing coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
- The program uses `func_2` to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers (`k_i`). This is because the LCM of the multipliers will give us the smallest number that is a multiple of all multipliers, ensuring that the total bet is less than the payout for any winning outcome.
- `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, and `func_2` uses `func_1` to calculate the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying the GCD calculation.
- After calculating the LCM, the program divides it by each multiplier to get the amount to bet on each outcome. If the sum of these amounts is not less than the LCM, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the amounts to bet on each outcome.

Given the problem and the execution summaries:
- `func_2` correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers.
- The logic in the main program correctly determines if a solution exists and prints the appropriate distribution of coins or `-1`.

Therefore, the given program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
