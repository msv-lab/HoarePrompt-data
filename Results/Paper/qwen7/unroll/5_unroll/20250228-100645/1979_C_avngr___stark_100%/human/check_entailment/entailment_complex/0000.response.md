Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for each possible winning outcome. This means for each \(k_i\), the sum of the bets should be less than \(k_i \times \text{bet}\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function calculates the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). This operation essentially simplifies the product of two numbers to their least common multiple (LCM).
   - **func_2(numbers)**: This function calculates the LCM of all the numbers in the list `numbers`. It iteratively applies `func_1` to pairs of numbers to find the LCM of the entire list.

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.
   - It calculates the LCM of all multipliers using `func_2(k)`.
   - It then calculates the bets by dividing the LCM by each multiplier.
   - It checks if the sum of these bets is less than the LCM. If so, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The LCM calculation ensures that the bets are distributed in such a way that the sum of the bets is minimized while still being less than the amount received for each winning outcome.
   - The logic correctly handles the condition that the sum of the bets must be strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
   - The example outputs match the expected results, indicating that the program works as intended.

Based on the above analysis, the given program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
