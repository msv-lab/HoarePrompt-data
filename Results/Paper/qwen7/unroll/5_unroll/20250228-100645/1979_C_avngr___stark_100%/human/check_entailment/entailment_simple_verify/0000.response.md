### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
- For each outcome \( i \), if it wins, we receive \( k_i \times \text{bet}_i \) coins.
- We need to ensure that the sum of all bets is strictly less than \( k_i \times \text{bet}_i \) for any winning outcome \( i \).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Functions**:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function computes the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). This is essentially the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
   - `func_2(numbers)`: This function computes the LCM of all numbers in the list `numbers`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program is to compute the LCM of all multipliers (`k_i`) and then distribute the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the LCM times any individual multiplier.
   - It calculates `m` as the LCM of all `k_i` using `func_2`.
   - It then distributes the coins by setting each bet to `m // k[i]`.
   - If the sum of all bets is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the distribution of bets.

#### Key Points:
- The LCM calculation ensures that the total bet is a multiple of each `k_i`.
- Distributing the coins as `m // k[i]` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than `k_i * (m // k[i])` for any winning outcome, because `m` is the LCM of all `k_i`.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
Consider the example test case:
```
3
3 2 7
```
- The LCM of 3, 2, and 7 is 42.
- The bets are distributed as `42 // 3 = 14`, `42 // 2 = 21`, and `42 // 7 = 6`.
- The total bet is `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`, which is less than 42.
- For each winning outcome:
  - If outcome 1 wins, we receive `3 * 14 = 42` coins, which is greater than 41.
  - If outcome 2 wins, we receive `2 * 21 = 42` coins, which is greater than 41.
  - If outcome 3 wins, we receive `7 * 6 = 42` coins, which is greater than 41.

This distribution satisfies the condition that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
