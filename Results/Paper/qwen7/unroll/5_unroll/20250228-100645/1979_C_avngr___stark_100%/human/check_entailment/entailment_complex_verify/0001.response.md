Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

### Problem Description Recap:
The goal is to distribute coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. Specifically, for each outcome \(i\), the condition is:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \]

### Key Points from the Annotated Code:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: Computes the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their GCD. This is essentially the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
2. **Function `func_2(numbers)`**: Computes the LCM of a list of numbers using `func_1`. However, this function is not necessary for solving the problem as described.

### Analysis of the Provided Solution:
- The main logic of the program is in the loop where it calculates `c` as `m // k[i]` for each outcome.
- `m` is the LCM of all `k_i` values computed by `func_2`.
- The program then checks if the sum of `c` values is less than or equal to `m`. If true, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid distribution. Otherwise, it prints the values of `c`.

### Correctness of the Provided Solution:
1. **Initialization of `m`**: `m` is the LCM of all `k_i` values. This ensures that `m` is the smallest number that is divisible by all `k_i`.
2. **Calculation of `c`**: `c[i] = m // k[i]` means that `c[i]` is the largest integer such that `c[i] * k[i] <= m`.
3. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of all `c[i]` values is less than `m`. If it is, then the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome, satisfying the problem requirements.

### Example Walkthrough:
- Consider the first test case: `3 3 7`.
  - `m` (LCM of 3 and 7) is 21.
  - `c` values are calculated as `21 // 3 = 7` and `21 // 7 = 3`.
  - Sum of `c` values is `7 + 3 = 10`, which is less than `21`. Hence, the program prints `7 3`.

This matches the expected output and the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem. The use of `func_1` and `func_2` is appropriate for calculating the LCM, which is a crucial step in determining the maximum possible bet for each outcome while ensuring the total bet is strictly less than the winnings.

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
