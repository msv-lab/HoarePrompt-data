Output State: `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, for each `test_case` in `test_cases`, if it's possible to reach the second row under the given conditions, the corresponding element in `results` is 'YES', otherwise it is 'NO'.
