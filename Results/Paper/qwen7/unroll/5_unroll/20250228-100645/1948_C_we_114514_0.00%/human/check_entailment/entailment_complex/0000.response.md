Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly initializes the necessary variables and structures to process each test case.
2. The function `func_1` iterates through each test case, checking if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).
3. The logic inside the function is designed to check if the robot can move from the first row to the second row by following the arrows.
4. The function correctly updates the `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` flags based on the direction of the arrows.
5. After processing all test cases, the function appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list based on whether the robot can reach the target cell.
6. The overall structure and logic of the function match the problem requirements and the provided example outputs.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
