Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and initializes a list to store the test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n`, the first row (`row1`), and the second row (`row2`).
3. The function `func_1` processes each test case to determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` by following the arrows.
4. The logic within `func_1` checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row by following the arrows. It uses two flags, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`, to track the possibility of reaching the second row.
5. The logic appears to be flawed because it only checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row by following the arrows without considering the sequence of moves. Specifically, it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement according to the problem statement.
6. The program should simulate the robot's movement step-by-step, moving down when necessary and following the direction of the arrows in both rows.

Given these points, the program is not correctly simulating the robot's movement as per the problem statement. Therefore, the logic in `func_1` is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
