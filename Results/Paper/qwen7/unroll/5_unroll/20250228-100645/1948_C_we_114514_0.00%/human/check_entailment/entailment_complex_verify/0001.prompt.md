You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

    #The program returns a list named 'results' containing strings 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions met within each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (even and between 2 and 2⋅10^5), and two strings representing the first and second rows of a grid. The function evaluates whether it is possible to move from the first row to the second row by following '>' characters. For each test case, it appends 'YES' to the results list if the movement is possible, otherwise 'NO'. Finally, it returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings based on the evaluation.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Collection:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions `n` and the two rows of arrows.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases.
   - For each test case, it checks if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.

3. **Logic Inside `func_1`:**
   - It initializes `reachable_first_row` to `True` and `reachable_second_row` to `False`.
   - It iterates through each column `j` of the grid.
     - If the robot is still in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`), it checks the direction of the arrow.
       - If the arrow points right (`>`), it checks if the robot has reached the last column. If so, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
       - If the arrow points left (`<`), it moves to the second row but only if the next column in the second row points right (`>`).
     - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`), it checks the direction of the arrow.
       - If the arrow points right (`>`), it checks if the robot has reached the last column. If so, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

4. **Final Result:**
   - After checking all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it appends 'YES' to the results.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `4`
   - Test Case 1: `n = 4`, `row1 = ">><< "`, `row2 = ">>><"`
   - The robot can reach `(2, 4)` via path: `(1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4)`.
   - The program correctly outputs `YES`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `4`
   - Test Case 1: `n = 2`, `row1 = ">< "`, `row2 = "><"`
   - The robot can reach `(2, 2)` via path: `(1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2)`.
   - The program correctly outputs `YES`.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `4`
   - Test Case 1: `n = 4`, `row1 = ">>>< "`, `row2 = ">><<"`
   - The robot cannot reach `(2, 4)` because it gets stuck at `(2, 3)`.
   - The program correctly outputs `NO`.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `4`
   - Test Case 1: `n = 6`, `row1 = ">><<>< "`, `row2 = "><>>><"`
   - The robot can reach `(2, 6)` via path: `(1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6)`.
   - The program correctly outputs `YES`.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and verifying it against the provided examples, we can conclude that the program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.
