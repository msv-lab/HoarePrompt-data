Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and for each test case, it reads the dimensions (`n`) and the configurations of the arrows in both rows of the grid. This part is correct.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` processes each test case. It initializes two boolean variables, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`, to track the possibility of reaching the last column of the grid starting from the first and second rows, respectively.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row and vice versa based on the direction of the arrows.
   - If the robot is in the first row and encounters a `>` (right arrow), it tries to move to the next column. If it reaches the end of the row, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
   - If the robot is in the first row and encounters a `<` (left arrow), it sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` and checks if the next column in the second row has a `>` (right arrow) to set `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
   - The same logic applies when the robot is in the second row.

4. **Final Check**: After processing all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it means the robot can reach the last column in the second row, and the function appends `'YES'` to the results. Otherwise, it appends `'NO'`.

5. **Output**: The function returns the list of results, which correctly indicates whether the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)` for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the logic in the function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the problem's requirements and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
