Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a`, the length of the list `n`, an integer `m`, and `m` pairs of integers `x_i` and `y_i`. For each pair, it checks if the elements at indices `x_i` and `y_i` in the list `a` satisfy certain conditions and returns appropriate values based on these checks.**

Given the constraints, the function processes a list `a` of length `n` where `n` is between 2 and \(10^5\), and the elements in `a` are in strictly increasing order. It also receives `m` queries, each consisting of two distinct indices `x_i` and `y_i` within the range of the list. The function evaluates these indices against the list `a` and returns results based on the specified conditions for each query.
