Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each input, there are two dictionaries d1 and d2 which store intermediate results of the calculations. There is also an integer s which accumulates the sum of absolute differences based on certain conditions. After processing all inputs, there are m queries where each query provides a range [start, end], and the output is the minimum value between the absolute differences calculated using d1 and d2 for the given range.
