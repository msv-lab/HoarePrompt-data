Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` containing `n` integers (each between 1 and `n` inclusive) and returns the count of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly twice in the list. It first counts the occurrences of each integer in the list using a dictionary, then determines how many integers have exactly two occurrences, and finally returns this count.**
