Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not simulate the game correctly according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the maximum score you can get based on the initial distribution of cards but does not account for the optimal strategy that Nene would use to minimize your score. 

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

Input:
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

According to the problem description, Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. In this case, if you play sub-optimally, Nene can still achieve a higher score. Hereâ€™s how the game might proceed:

1. You play a card with the number 1, and Nene plays the other card with the number 1, scoring 1 point for you.
2. You play a card with the number 2, and Nene plays the other card with the number 2, scoring 1 point for you.
3. You play a card with the number 3, and Nene plays the other card with the number 3, scoring 1 point for you.

Thus, you can get up to 1 point in this scenario. However, the provided program only checks if there are two cards of the same number in your hand and returns the count of such pairs, which is 1 in this case. This approach does not account for Nene's optimal strategy to minimize your score.

Therefore, the program does not correctly simulate the game as described, and hence the correctness is **False**.
