Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is a series of integers read from input within the range of 1 to 10^4, `a` remains unchanged, and `buffer` is an empty list. After executing all iterations, the state of `buffer` remains unchanged, and `t` is decremented by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. The value of `n` and its corresponding list `w` are updated in each iteration, and the variable `res` holds the calculated result for each valid `n` (i.e., `n >= 3`). If `n < 3`, the output is `0`.
