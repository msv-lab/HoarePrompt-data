Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list of non-negative integers a (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of t, n, and the list a.**

This means the function takes multiple test cases as input indirectly through parameters within those test cases. Each test case contains a count `t`, a size `n`, and a list `a` of non-negative integers. The function processes these inputs and returns specific information related to them.
