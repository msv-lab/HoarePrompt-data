### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, but string `c` does not match it.
2. **Template Matching Logic**: For a template character to be valid, either both `a[i]` and `b[i]` should match the template character (if it's a lowercase letter) or neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` should match the template character (if it's an uppercase letter). However, `c[i]` should not match the template character.
3. **Current Implementation Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and initializes `l` to `'YES'`.
   - It iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n`, strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It then checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]` for all positions `i`. If this condition holds, it sets `l` to `'YES'`, otherwise, it sets `l` to `'NO'`.
   - Finally, it prints `l`.

4. **Issues with Current Implementation**:
   - The logic to set `l` to `'YES'` only when both `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]` is incorrect. This would mean that even if `a` and `b` match some template and `c` does not, the program will still print `'NO'` because the condition is not met for all positions.
   - The correct approach should check if there exists any position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` match the template and `c[i]` does not.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Iterate through each position `i` and check if `a[i]` and `b[i]` can be part of a template while `c[i]` cannot.
   - If such a position is found, set `l` to `'YES'` and break out of the loop.
   - If no such position is found after checking all positions, set `l` to `'NO'`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        l = 'YES'
        for i in range(n):
            if (a[i] == c[i] and b[i] == c[i]) or (a[i].islower() and a[i] == c[i].lower()) or (b[i].islower() and b[i] == c[i].lower()):
                l = 'NO'
                break
        print(l)
```

### Conclusion:
The current implementation is incorrect. After correcting the logic, the program should correctly determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not.

**Correctness: **False**
