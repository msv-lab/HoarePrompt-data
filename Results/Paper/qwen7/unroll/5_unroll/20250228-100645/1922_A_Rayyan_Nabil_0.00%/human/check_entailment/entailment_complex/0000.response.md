Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic inside the nested loop is flawed. The current implementation checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]` and sets `l` to 'YES' if this condition is met for any position `i`. However, this does not ensure that both `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not. Instead, the program should check if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` match the lowercase version of `c[i]` when `c[i]` is lowercase, and if `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match the lowercase version of `c[i]` when `c[i]` is uppercase.

Here's a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()

        valid_template = True
        for i in range(n):
            if c[i].islower():
                if a[i] != c[i] or b[i] != c[i]:
                    valid_template = False
                    break
            elif c[i].isupper():
                if a[i] == c[i].lower() or b[i] == c[i].lower():
                    valid_template = False
                    break
        
        if valid_template:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")
```

With this corrected logic, the program properly checks if both `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.

Correctness: **False**
