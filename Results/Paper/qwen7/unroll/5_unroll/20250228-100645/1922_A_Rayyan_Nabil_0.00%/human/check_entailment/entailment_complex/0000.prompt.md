Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, and c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `l` is either 'YES' or 'NO', `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `c` remains unchanged.
    #
    #After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `l` will be determined based on the conditions inside the nested loop. If for any string `i` from `n`, the characters at that position in `a` and `b` do not match the character at the same position in `c`, then `l` will be set to 'YES'. Otherwise, if no such positions exist, `l` will be set to 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20). It checks if for every position `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the characters in `a[i]` and `b[i]` both match the character in `c[i]`. If there exists at least one position where this condition is not met, it sets `l` to 'YES'; otherwise, it sets `l` to 'NO'. After processing all test cases, it prints the value of `l` for each case.
