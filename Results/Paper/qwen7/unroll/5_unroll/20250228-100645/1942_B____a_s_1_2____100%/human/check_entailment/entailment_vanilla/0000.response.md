### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to construct a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \), where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The function needs to ensure that the constructed permutation \( p \) satisfies this condition.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution initializes a list `p` with `-1` values.
   - It iterates through the array `a` in reverse order.
   - For each index `i`, it calculates \( p[i] \) as \( \texttt{mex} - a[i] \).
   - It updates the `mex` value to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the calculated \( p[i] \).

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic seems to be attempting to construct the permutation by ensuring that the MEX condition holds for each position.
   - However, the key issue lies in how the `mex` value is being updated and used. Specifically, the update of `mex` might not correctly reflect the MEX value for the subsequent positions in the permutation.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input: `n = 3`, `a = [1, 1, 1]`.
   - According to the problem, the MEX of an empty set is 0, so \( p_1 \) should be 0.
   - Then, \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}([0]) - 0 = 1 \), which is correct.
   - For \( p_2 \), the MEX of `[0, x]` should be 1 (since 0 is already used), so \( p_2 \) should be 0.
   - But the code would calculate \( p_2 \) as \( \texttt{mex} - a[1] = 3 - 1 = 2 \), which is incorrect.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would involve maintaining a separate list to track the used indices and calculating the MEX dynamically for each position.

### Conclusion:
The given solution is incorrect because it does not properly handle the calculation of the MEX value and the construction of the permutation. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
