Reasoning:
1. The provided code correctly initializes the permutation array `p` with `-1` values and calculates the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value for each position in reverse order.
2. The logic for calculating `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]` and updating `mex` to be the minimum of itself and `p[i]` is accurate and follows the problem's definition.
3. The code iterates through each test case, ensuring that the constraints and guarantees mentioned in the problem statement are respected.
4. The final state of `p` is printed for each test case, which should satisfy the conditions given in the problem.

Given these points, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem.

Correctness: **True**
