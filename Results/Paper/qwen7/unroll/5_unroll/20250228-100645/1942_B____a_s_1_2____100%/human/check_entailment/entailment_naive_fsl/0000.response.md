Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a permutation \( p \) that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, the logic used to assign values to the permutation \( p \) does not ensure that the MEX condition is met for each index \( i \).

Let's consider the following example:

### Example Input:
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

### Expected Output:
A valid permutation \( p \) could be `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]` as mentioned in the example.

### Program Output:
When running the provided program with the given input, it generates a different permutation. Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: `mex = n`
2. **Loop from \( n-1 \) to 0**:
   - For \( i = 4 \): `p[4] = mex - a[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, then `mex = min(mex, p[4]) = 3`
   - For \( i = 3 \): `p[3] = mex - a[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, then `mex = min(mex, p[3]) = 2`
   - For \( i = 2 \): `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, then `mex = min(mex, p[2]) = 4`
   - For \( i = 1 \): `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 4 - 1 = 3`, then `mex = min(mex, p[1]) = 3`
   - For \( i = 0 \): `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 3 - 1 = 2`, then `mex = min(mex, p[0]) = 2`

Thus, the generated permutation is `[2, 3, 4, 2, 3]`.

### Issue:
The generated permutation `[2, 3, 4, 2, 3]` does not satisfy the MEX condition for all indices. For instance, for \( i = 3 \), the MEX of `[2, 3, 4, 2]` is 0, but \( a_3 = -2 \), which means the MEX condition is not satisfied.

Therefore, the program does not correctly generate a valid permutation \( p \) for the given input, making it incorrect.
