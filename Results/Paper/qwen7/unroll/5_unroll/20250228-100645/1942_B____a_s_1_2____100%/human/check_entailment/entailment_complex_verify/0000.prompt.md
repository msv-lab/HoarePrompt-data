You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]

        print(*p)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [-1] * n
        
        mex = n
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: After executing the loop for `t` times, the variable `p` will contain an array of integers for each iteration, where each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` and `mex` is updated to be the minimum of itself and `p[i]` during each iteration. The final state of `p` for each iteration is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (size of the array), and an array `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates a valid permutation `p` for the given array `a`, where each element `p[i]` is determined as `mex - a[i]` and `mex` is updated to be the minimum of itself and `p[i]` during each iteration. Finally, it prints the resulting permutation `p` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a permutation \( p \) that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, the logic used to assign values to the permutation \( p \) does not ensure that the MEX condition is met for each index \( i \).

Let's consider the following example:

### Example Input:
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

### Expected Output:
A valid permutation \( p \) could be `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]` as mentioned in the example.

### Program Output:
When running the provided program with the given input, it generates a different permutation. Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: `mex = n`
2. **Loop from \( n-1 \) to 0**:
   - For \( i = 4 \): `p[4] = mex - a[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, then `mex = min(mex, p[4]) = 3`
   - For \( i = 3 \): `p[3] = mex - a[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, then `mex = min(mex, p[3]) = 2`
   - For \( i = 2 \): `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, then `mex = min(mex, p[2]) = 4`
   - For \( i = 1 \): `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 4 - 1 = 3`, then `mex = min(mex, p[1]) = 3`
   - For \( i = 0 \): `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 3 - 1 = 2`, then `mex = min(mex, p[0]) = 2`

Thus, the generated permutation is `[2, 3, 4, 2, 3]`.

### Issue:
The generated permutation `[2, 3, 4, 2, 3]` does not satisfy the MEX condition for all indices. For instance, for \( i = 3 \), the MEX of `[2, 3, 4, 2]` is 0, but \( a_3 = -2 \), which means the MEX condition is not satisfied.

Therefore, the program does not correctly generate a valid permutation \( p \) for the given input, making it incorrect.
