Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m`, and the grid itself.
3. It then checks specific conditions to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color:
   - If the first row and the last row are identical and contain only one type of character ('W' or 'B'), or if every row is identical and contains only one type of character ('W' or 'B') but the first row is different from the last row, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

However, there are some issues with the logic:
- The condition `len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row` is not sufficient to cover all cases where the grid can be made uniform. This condition only checks the first and last rows, but it doesn't check other rows.
- The program should check if all rows are the same and if they are not, it should check if all columns are the same.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the logic:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
        
        # Check if all rows are the same
        if len(set(a)) == 1:
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Check if all columns are the same
        for j in range(m):
            col = ''.join([a[i][j] for i in range(n)])
            if len(set(col)) > 1:
                break
        else:
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        print('NO')
```

Given the original program's logic, it does not fully cover all scenarios where the grid can be made uniform. Therefore, the original program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
