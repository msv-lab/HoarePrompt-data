Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each test case, if the first row and the last row are identical and contain only one type of character ('W' or 'B'), or if every row is identical and contains only one type of character ('W' or 'B') but the first row is different from the last row, then 'NO' will be printed for that test case. Otherwise, 'YES' will be printed.
