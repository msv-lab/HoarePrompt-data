Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has some logical flaws that prevent it from correctly determining whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Conditions for "NO":**
   - The condition `if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and (a[0] != a[-1]):` checks if the first and last rows are different but have the same color. This is not sufficient to conclude that it's impossible to make all squares the same color.
   - Similarly, the condition `elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)) == 1 and (first_row != last_row):` also checks the first and last rows but is not comprehensive enough.

2. **Insufficient Handling of Grid Operations:**
   - The logic does not fully account for the possibility of making all squares the same color through a series of operations involving subrectangles. It only checks the first and last rows and columns, which is not a complete solution.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if there exists any row or column that contains both 'W' and 'B'. If such a row or column exists, then it is impossible to make all squares the same color because any operation can only change the color within a subrectangle defined by two squares of the same color.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = []
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
        
        # Check if any row or column contains both 'W' and 'B'
        for i in range(n):
            if 'W' in a[i] and 'B' in a[i]:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            for j in range(m):
                col = ''.join([a[i][j] for i in range(n)])
                if 'W' in col and 'B' in col:
                    print('NO')
                    break
            else:
                print('YES')

func()
```

This version checks each row and column to see if it contains both 'W' and 'B'. If it finds such a row or column, it prints 'NO' immediately. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. This approach ensures that the solution is correct according to the problem statement.
