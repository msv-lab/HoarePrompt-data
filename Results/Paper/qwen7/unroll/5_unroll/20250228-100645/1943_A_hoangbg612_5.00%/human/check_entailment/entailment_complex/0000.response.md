Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting the Array**: The code sorts the array `N` which is a good start for determining the MEX.
3. **Initialization**: `cur` is initialized to `-1`, and `M` is a dictionary used to count occurrences of each number in the sorted array.
4. **Processing the Sorted Array**:
   - The code iterates through the sorted array and updates `cur` based on the following logic:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it breaks out of the loop since `cur + 1` would be the new MEX.
     - Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and increments the count in the dictionary `M` for that number.
   - This part of the logic aims to find the first gap in the sequence of numbers, but it doesn't fully capture the optimal strategy for both players.
5. **Final Adjustment**: The code checks if the sum of counts in `M` equals `S` (the length of the array). If so, it increments `cur` by 1.
6. **Finding the MEX**: The code then finds the largest number `i` such that the count of `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`.

However, the logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The key issue is that the code does not properly simulate the game where Alice and Bob make their optimal moves. Specifically, Alice can strategically choose elements to maximize the MEX, and Bob can minimize it. The current implementation does not account for these strategic choices.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the optimal strategies for both players. Given that Alice can always pick the smallest available number to maximize the MEX and Bob will try to pick numbers that minimize the MEX, the solution should reflect these strategies.

Given the provided code does not correctly simulate the game and the optimal strategies, the logic is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
