You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = -1
        M = {}
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
            cur += 1
        for i in range(cur):
            if M[i] <= i:
                cur = i
                break
        print(cur)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers and then determines the maximum value of `cur` based on specific conditions. Finally, it prints the maximum value of `cur` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `T` is read as the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `S` (which is actually `N`, the size of the array) is read.
   - The array `N` is then split and converted into a list of integers.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted. This is unnecessary for solving the problem since the order of elements does not affect the MEX calculation directly.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `cur` is initialized to `-1`.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the count of each number in the sorted array.

4. **Populating the Dictionary:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates the dictionary `M`.
   - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and increments its count in `M`.
   - If the current number `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - If the sum of counts in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then iterates from 0 to `cur` and checks if the count of `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it sets `cur` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints `cur`.

### Correctness Analysis

The program aims to simulate the game and calculate the MEX of the resulting array `c`. However, there are several issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the sorted array can be used to determine the MEX. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c`, not just the smallest number in the sorted array.
   - The program only considers the counts of numbers and does not ensure that the MEX is correctly determined.

2. **Unnecessary Sorting:**
   - Sorting the array `N` is unnecessary and can be omitted without affecting the correctness of the solution.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Counts:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the counts to ensure that the MEX is calculated properly. It only checks if the count of a number is less than or equal to the number itself, which is not sufficient to determine the MEX.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
