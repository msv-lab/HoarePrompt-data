### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The program needs to check if a given password meets specific criteria.
   - The password must consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - All letters must be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - All digits must be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - There should be no digit immediately following a letter.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the password length (`n`) and the password itself.
   - It then separates the password into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the password to ensure there is no digit immediately following a letter.
   - If any of these conditions fail, it returns "NO". Otherwise, it returns "YES".

3. **Checking the Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly separates the password into letters and digits.
   - It checks the sorting of both `letters` and `digits` lists.
   - It correctly identifies invalid sequences where a digit follows a letter.
   - The logic flow is consistent with the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles empty strings and strings with only letters or only digits correctly.
   - It correctly handles strings with mixed letters and digits.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the problem description, we can identify a potential issue with the logic for checking the sequence of characters.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Separation of Letters and Digits:**
  - The code correctly separates the password into `letters` and `digits` lists.

- **Sorting Checks:**
  - The code checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order using `if (letters != sorted(letters)) :`.
  - Similarly, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order using `if (digits != sorted(digits)) :`.

- **Sequence Check:**
  - The code iterates through the password to ensure there is no digit immediately following a letter using `for i in range(len(password) - 1): if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():`.

### Potential Issue:

- The code assumes that if the `letters` and `digits` lists are sorted, and there are no digits immediately following letters, the password is valid. However, this does not guarantee that the password meets the requirement of having no digit before a letter.

### Example Counter-Case:

Consider the password `1a2b`. This password satisfies the following:
- All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order (`['a', 'b']`).
- All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order (`['1', '2']`).
- There are no digits immediately following letters.

However, the password `1a2b` is not a valid password according to the problem statement because it has a digit before a letter.

### Corrected Logic:

To ensure the password is valid, we need to check if there is no letter immediately following a digit. This can be done by iterating through the password and checking the reverse condition.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isdigit() and password[i + 1].isalpha():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was inaccurate because the code does not correctly handle the condition of ensuring no digit immediately follows a letter. The corrected logic ensures that the password is checked properly.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
