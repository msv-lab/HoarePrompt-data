### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The program needs to check if a given password meets specific criteria.
   - The password must consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - All letters must be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - All digits must be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - There should be no digit immediately following a letter.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the password length (`n`) and the password itself.
   - It then separates the password into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the password to ensure there is no digit immediately following a letter.
   - If any of these conditions fail, it returns "NO". Otherwise, it returns "YES".

3. **Checking the Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly separates the password into letters and digits.
   - It checks the sorting of both `letters` and `digits` lists.
   - It correctly identifies invalid sequences where a digit follows a letter.
   - The logic flow is consistent with the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles empty strings and strings with only letters or only digits correctly.
   - It correctly handles strings with mixed letters and digits.

However, upon closer inspection, there is a subtle issue with the logic that checks for the condition where a digit does not come after a letter. The current implementation uses a single loop to check this condition, which can miss some edge cases. Specifically, the loop only checks up to the second last character, which means it does not check the last character of the password against the next character (which would be out of bounds).

To illustrate, consider the password "123a". The current implementation will correctly identify that "123" is sorted and "a" is sorted, but it will not check if "3" is followed by "a", which violates the rule.

### Corrected Implementation:
```python
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    # Check the last character
    if password[-1].isdigit() and len(digits) > 0:
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate in its reasoning and conclusion. However, the original implementation had a minor flaw that could be missed in certain edge cases. The corrected implementation ensures that the last character is also checked properly.

### Final:
**True**
