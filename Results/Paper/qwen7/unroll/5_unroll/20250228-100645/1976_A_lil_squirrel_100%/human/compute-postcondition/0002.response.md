Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for ch in password:`. The objects involved here are `ch` and `password`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - `ch` is the variable that will take on each character of `password` in each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop execution condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are characters left in `password`. This means the loop will run from the first character to the last character of `password`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over each character in `password`, `ch` will take on the value of each character in `password` one by one.
   - For the loop to start executing, `password` must have at least one character (since `ch` will be set to the first character of `password` in the first iteration).

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `password` must have at least one character.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`letters` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least one character, `digits` is an empty list**.
