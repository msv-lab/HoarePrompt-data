Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each case includes two positive integers n and k, and a list of n distinct integers ranging from 1 to n. For each test case, the function determines if the sum of n ⋅ k across all test cases exceeds 2 ⋅ 10^5. It also ensures that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and n ⋅ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The function returns whether the conditions are met for all test cases.**
