Precondition: **t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and n ⋅ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Each screenshot is represented as a list of n distinct integers ranging from 1 to n. The sum of n ⋅ k across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. All authors of the screenshots are different.**
