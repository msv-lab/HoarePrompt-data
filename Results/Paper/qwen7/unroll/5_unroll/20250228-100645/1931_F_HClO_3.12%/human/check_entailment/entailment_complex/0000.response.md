### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Checks**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` (which should be `k`), and the first two screenshots.
   - It handles the special case where `m == 1` by directly printing "yes" and skipping further checks.

2. **Comparing Screenshots**:
   - The function compares the first two screenshots (`l1` and `l2`) after removing the author's position.
   - If the modified lists do not match, it prints "no" and skips further checks for that test case.

3. **Finding Insertion Points**:
   - The function attempts to find the correct insertion points for the author's position in the screenshots.
   - It iterates through the lists to find the correct positions and ensures the lists match after insertion.

4. **Handling Multiple Screenshots**:
   - If the first two screenshots match after removing the author's position, the function proceeds to check subsequent screenshots.
   - It uses a list `val` to store additional screenshots and their modified versions.
   - It checks if the modified lists match the expected positions and prints "no" if any mismatch is found.

5. **Final Output**:
   - If all checks pass, it prints "yes".
   - If any mismatch is found during the checks, it prints "no".

Given the detailed steps and the logic flow, the annotated program correctly implements the solution for the problem statement. The function handles all edge cases and follows the specified rules for determining if the screenshots can correspond to a consistent order of participants.

### Correctness:
**True**
