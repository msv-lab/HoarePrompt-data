The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of distinct integers ranging from 1 to n, where n and k satisfy specific constraints. For each test case, it checks if certain conditions are met and inserts elements into one of the lists based on these conditions. If all test cases meet the conditions, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.
