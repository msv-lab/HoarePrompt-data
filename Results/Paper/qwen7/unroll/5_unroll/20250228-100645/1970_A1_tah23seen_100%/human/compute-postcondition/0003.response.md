Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d`[0] is 0.**

Explanation: The code `d[0] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the key `0` in the dictionary `d`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `s` remains a string consisting only of characters `(` and `)`, `n` remains the length of the string `s`, `ans` remains an empty string, and `d` now contains the key-value pair `0: 0`.
