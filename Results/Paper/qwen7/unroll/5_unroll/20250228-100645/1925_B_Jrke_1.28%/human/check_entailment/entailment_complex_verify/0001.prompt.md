You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers \( x \) and \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the maximum value among 1, \( i \), and \( x \) divided by \( i \), where \( i \) ranges from 1 (if \( x \) is even) to the largest odd number less than or equal to the square root of \( x \), provided that both \( i \) and \( x \) divided by \( i \) are less than or equal to \( k \) (where \( k \) is \( x \) divided by \( n \)). It prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.

2. **Initial Calculation:**
   - It calculates `k = x // n`, which gives the minimum difficulty per sub-problem if the sub-problems were evenly distributed.
   - If `k` equals 1, it directly prints `1` because the smallest possible positive integer difficulty is 1, and the GCD of multiple 1s is 1.

3. **Finding Maximum Balance:**
   - If `k` is greater than 1, it enters a loop to find the maximum possible GCD.
   - The loop iterates over odd numbers starting from `1` (if `x` is even) or `2` (if `x` is odd) up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each odd number `i` that divides `x`, it checks both `i` and `x // i` to see if they are less than or equal to `k`.
   - It keeps track of the maximum GCD found (`ans`).

### Correctness Check:

1. **Handling `k == 1`:**
   - If `k == 1`, the program correctly prints `1`. This is correct because the smallest possible difficulty is 1, and the GCD of multiple 1s is 1.

2. **Finding Maximum GCD:**
   - The loop iterates over odd divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` and `x // i` are valid sub-problems (i.e., their sum should be `x` and they should not exceed `k`).
   - This approach ensures that we are considering the largest possible GCD values first, which is optimal for finding the maximum balance.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `x` is even or odd correctly by starting the loop from the appropriate value.
   - It also correctly handles the case where `x` is a prime number, as the only divisors would be `1` and `x` itself, leading to a GCD of `1`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset. It considers all necessary conditions and handles edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
