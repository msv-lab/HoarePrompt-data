Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence based on the input number, but it doesn't correctly calculate the number of increasing subsequences. It seems to be trying to use binary representation and bitwise operations to construct the sequence, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.

2. **Output Mismatch**: The program prints the length of the generated sequence followed by the sequence itself. However, the logic inside `func_1` does not ensure that the generated sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. 

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `X` is very large or when no valid sequence can be constructed.

4. **No Handling for No Solution**: The program does not correctly handle the case where it determines that no valid sequence can be constructed for a given `X`. Instead, it generates a sequence, which may or may not meet the requirement.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to devise a strategy to generate sequences that meet the exact count of increasing subsequences. This typically involves understanding how to construct sequences using combinatorial methods or dynamic programming techniques. The current implementation does not achieve this.
