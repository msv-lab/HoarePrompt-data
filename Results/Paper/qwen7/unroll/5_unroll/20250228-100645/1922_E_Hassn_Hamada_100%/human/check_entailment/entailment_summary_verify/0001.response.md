### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate an array of integers with a specified number of increasing subsequences, `X`. The array length should not exceed 200, and all elements should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].

2. **Input and Output Format**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we need to output either `-1` if no such array exists, or the length of the array followed by the array elements.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to generate the sequence based on the input number.
   - The function uses bit manipulation to determine the structure of the sequence needed to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Bit Manipulation Logic**:
   - The function iterates backward from the maximum possible value in the current sequence.
   - It calculates the size of the next segment (`size`) and its starting value (`value`).
   - It checks if the calculated `value` can fit into the remaining `number`.
   - If it fits, it updates the `size_overlap` and breaks out of the loop.
   - It then appends the appropriate values to the sequence and recursively calls itself with the updated `number`.

5. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - It initializes an empty list `result` and calls `func_1` with `n-1` (since the function is designed to handle `n-1`).
   - It prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the base case when `number` is 0.
   - It ensures that the sequence is built correctly using bit manipulation and recursion.

### Verification:

- The function `func_1` correctly generates sequences based on the input number.
- The main loop processes each test case and prints the results in the correct format.
- However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of `func_1`:
  - The function `func_1` does not properly handle the generation of sequences for larger values of `X`.
  - Specifically, the function does not ensure that the generated sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic for determining the `size_overlap` and appending elements to the sequence is flawed and may lead to incorrect results for certain values of `X`.

### Example Counter-Example:

Consider the test case where `X = 37`. The expected output is `[ -1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1 ]`, which has exactly 37 increasing subsequences. However, the provided function `func_1` does not guarantee this result. The function may generate a sequence that does not meet the requirement of having exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The function `func_1` has a logical flaw that prevents it from generating sequences with the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by `X`.

### Final Answer:

Final: **False**
