    #Explanation: The loop iterates over a range from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to 0. However, the initial state provided does not include the value of `sequence`, which is crucial for determining the start of the loop. Without knowing the value of `sequence`, we cannot determine the exact behavior of the loop. Given that the initial state of `size_overlap` is (0, 0), and assuming `sequence` is less than or equal to 0 (since it's the default value), the loop will not execute any iterations, leaving `size_overlap` unchanged at (0, 0).
    size, overlap = size_overlap
    for i in range(size - overlap):
        sequence.append(i + overlap)
        
    #State: Output State: `size` is 0, `overlap` is 0, `sequence` is [].
    func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `sequence`, a list of integers. It generates a new sequence based on the input `number` and updates the `sequence` list. If `number` is 0, the function returns two zeros. Otherwise, it calculates a `size_overlap` pair and uses it to append elements to `sequence`. Finally, it recursively calls itself with updated parameters until `number` becomes 0, at which point it returns two zeros.
