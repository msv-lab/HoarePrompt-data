Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not seem to generate the correct sequence of numbers to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

To illustrate this, let's consider a few test cases:

1. For `X = 2`, the correct output should be an array of length 1 with a single element `0`. However, the program generates a sequence that does not meet this requirement. For example, running the program with `X = 2` results in an array `[0]`, which is correct, but the program's logic for generating other values of `X` is flawed.

2. For `X = 5`, the correct output should be an array of length 3 with elements `[0, 1, 0]`. However, the program does not generate this sequence correctly. Instead, it produces an array like `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]`, which has more than 5 increasing subsequences.

3. For `X = 37`, the correct output should be an array of length 7 with elements `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]`. However, the program does not generate this sequence correctly. It produces an array that does not match the required number of increasing subsequences.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly handle the generation of arrays with the specified number of increasing subsequences for various values of `X`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
