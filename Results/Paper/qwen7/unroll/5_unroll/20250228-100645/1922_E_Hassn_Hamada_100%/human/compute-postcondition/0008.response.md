Output State: **`size` is 0, `overlap` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `size, overlap = size_overlap` unpacks the tuple `size_overlap`, which initially is `(0, 0)`. This means that `size` is assigned the value `0` and `overlap` is assigned the value `0`. Since no other operations are performed on these variables within the given code snippet, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `size` is 0, `overlap` is 0.
