Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1` Analysis
1. **Function Purpose**: This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. **Logic**:
   - If the array is already sorted (`all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`), it returns 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there is at least one pair where the current element is greater than the next element (`any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`). If such a pair exists, it returns 'No'.
   - If no such pair exists, it implicitly returns 'Yes'.

This logic correctly identifies if the array is already sorted. However, it does not handle the possibility of sorting the array through the specified operation (splitting and swapping).

#### Function `func_2` Analysis
1. **Function Purpose**: This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
2. **Logic**:
   - It reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - It splits the input into individual components.
   - For each test case, it extracts the necessary information (number of elements and the array).
   - It calls `func_1` with the array and appends the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results.

This part of the code is correct and handles the input and output as required.

### Correctness Check
To determine if the overall program is correct, we need to verify if `func_1` correctly identifies whether the array can be sorted using the specified operation.

#### Issue with `func_1`
The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted. It does not account for the possibility of sorting the array by splitting and swapping. For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`. Although this array is not sorted, it can be sorted by splitting it into `[3, 1]` and `[4, 1, 5]`, and then swapping them to get `[4, 1, 5, 3, 1]`.

Therefore, `func_1` alone is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operation.

### Conclusion
Since `func_1` does not correctly handle the scenario where the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping, the overall program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
