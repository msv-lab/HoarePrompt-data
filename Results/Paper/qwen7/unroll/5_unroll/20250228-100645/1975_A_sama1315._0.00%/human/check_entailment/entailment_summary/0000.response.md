Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts (a prefix and a suffix) and swapping them. The solution involves checking if the array is already sorted or if it can be sorted through the described operation.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using a simple check: `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No' if there is at least one element that is greater than the next element; otherwise, it incorrectly returns 'Yes'.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the array and appending the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints each result on a new line.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - The core logic in `func_1` is flawed because it incorrectly returns 'Yes' when there is no element that is greater than the next element. This means it would incorrectly identify some arrays as sortable when they are not.
   - However, the problem statement does not require sorting the entire array but rather checking if it can be sorted by the described operation, which `func_1` does not address correctly.
   - Given the problem's requirements, `func_1` should check if the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing, not just if it is already sorted.

Since `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
