Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and `t` is the integer input by the user.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial condition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 remains valid, but now `t` specifically holds the value of the integer input by the user.
