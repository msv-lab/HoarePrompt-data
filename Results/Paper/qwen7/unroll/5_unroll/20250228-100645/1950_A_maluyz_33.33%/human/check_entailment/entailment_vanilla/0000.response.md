Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
   - It checks if `a == b == c` and prints 'NONE' if all three numbers are equal.
   - It checks if `max(a, b, c) == b` and prints 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'NONE'.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where `a > b > c` for 'PEAK'.
   - The program does not handle the case where `a > b < c` or `a < b > c` for 'STAIR'.
   - The program does not handle the case where `a == b` and `b != c` or similar scenarios which should be considered for 'STAIR' or 'PEAK'.

### Example Test Cases:
- For the input `1 2 3`, the output is 'STAIR' because `1 < 2 < 3`.
- For the input `3 2 1`, the output is 'NONE' because it does not satisfy any of the conditions.
- For the input `1 5 3`, the output is 'PEAK' because `1 < 5 > 3`.
- For the input `3 4 1`, the output is 'PEAK' because `3 < 4 > 1`.
- For the input `0 0 0`, the output is 'NONE' because all three numbers are equal.
- For the input `4 1 7`, the output is 'NONE' because it does not satisfy any of the conditions.
- For the input `4 5 7`, the output is 'STAIR' because `4 < 5 < 7`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly identify all cases for 'STAIR' and 'PEAK'. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where `a > b > c` for 'PEAK' and cases where `a < b > c` or `a > b < c` for 'STAIR'. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
