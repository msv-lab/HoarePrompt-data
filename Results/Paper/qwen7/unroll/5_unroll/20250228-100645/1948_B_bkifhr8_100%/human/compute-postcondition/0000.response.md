Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, n is an input integer where 2 <= n <= 50.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, maintaining its initial state as a positive integer between 1 and 10^3. The value of `n` is now an integer input by the user, constrained to be between 2 and 50.
