Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Specifically, the program checks if the current element is less than the previous element and attempts to sort them by splitting the larger number into its digits. However, the logic for checking and sorting is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
```
4
12 3 45 67
```

The program's output for this case is "YES", but the correct output should be "NO". Here's why:

1. The array is initially `[12, 3, 45, 67]`.
2. The program checks if `67` is less than `45`. It is not, so it moves to the next pair.
3. The program checks if `45` is less than `3`. It is not, so it moves to the next pair.
4. The program checks if `3` is less than `12`. It is not, so it concludes that the array can be sorted without further operations.

However, the array cannot be sorted by the given operations. Splitting `67` into `[6, 7]` and inserting them in place does not help, as the array would become `[12, 3, 6, 7, 45]`, which is still not sorted. Similarly, other splits do not lead to a sorted array.

Thus, the program fails to correctly determine if the array can be sorted, making it incorrect.
