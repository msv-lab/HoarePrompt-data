Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, n is an input integer where 2 <= n <= 50, each iteration of the loop processes a list `arr` of integers `m` (where 1 <= m), and determines if the list can be transformed by swapping adjacent elements to make the first element of each pair non-decreasing, printing 'YES' if possible or 'NO' otherwise after all iterations.
