Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by n integers. For each test case, it checks if the list of integers can be transformed by swapping adjacent elements to ensure the first element of each pair is non-decreasing. If possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function iterates through all test cases and outputs the result for each one.**
