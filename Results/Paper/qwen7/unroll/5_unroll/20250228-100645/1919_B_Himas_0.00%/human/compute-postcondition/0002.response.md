Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and s is an integer, e is a string of length n consisting of characters '+' and '-', where '+' represents 1 and '-' represents -1 in an array a of length n. After all iterations of the loop, for each test case, P and M are integers representing the count of '+' and '-' characters in the string e respectively, and the output is the value of P - M printed for each test case.
