Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes values t, n, and s, where t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer between 1 and 5000, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters '+' and '-'. The function returns an integer. If the characters in s represent an array a of length n where '+' is 1 and '-' is -1, the function calculates and returns the sum of the elements in array a.**
