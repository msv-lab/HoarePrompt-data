Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `s`, a string `e` consisting of '+' and '-' characters, and calculates the difference between the count of '+' characters (each counted as 1) and '-' characters (each counted as -1). It then prints this difference for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
