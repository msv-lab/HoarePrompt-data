Output State: `s` is the string resulting from concatenating all characters from `s` based on the sorted balance values in `d`. `n` is the length of `s`. `ans` is equal to `s`. `d` is a dictionary where each key from 0 to n-1 (inclusive) contains an integer value representing the balance of "(" and ")" up to that index in `s`, sorted based on the tuple `(x[1], -x[0])` for each item `x` in `d`.
