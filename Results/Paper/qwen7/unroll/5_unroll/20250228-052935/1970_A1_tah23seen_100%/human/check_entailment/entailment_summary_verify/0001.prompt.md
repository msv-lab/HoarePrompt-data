You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")" and ensures it is a balanced parentheses sequence. It then constructs a new string `ans` by concatenating the characters from `s` based on the sorted balance values of "(" and ")" up to each index in `s`. The balance values are sorted primarily by the number of ")" and secondarily by the negative index. The function returns the new string `ans`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It calls a function `func_1(s)` and prints the result.
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the string `s`.

2. **Calculating Prefix Balances:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the balance of the prefix up to each position in the string.
   - It uses a dictionary `d` where `d[i+1]` stores the balance at position `i`.
   - For each character in the string, it updates the balance in the dictionary.

3. **Sorting the Balances:**
   - After calculating the balances, it removes the entry corresponding to the length of the string (`d.pop(n)`).
   - It sorts the dictionary items based on the balance values and positions.
   - The sorting key is a tuple `(x[1], -x[0])`, meaning it sorts by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order when there are ties.

4. **Constructing the Result String:**
   - The function constructs the result string `ans` by appending characters from the original string `s` based on the sorted positions.

### Verification

To verify correctness, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Input:** `(()(()))`
- **Expected Output:** `()(()())`

#### Detailed Walkthrough:

1. **Calculate Prefix Balances:**
   - Position 1: Balance = 1 (('('))
   - Position 2: Balance = 2 (('(', '('))
   - Position 3: Balance = 1 (('(', '(', ')'))
   - Position 4: Balance = 2 (('(', '(', '(', '('))
   - Position 5: Balance = 3 (('(', '(', '(', '(', ')'))
   - Position 6: Balance = 2 (('(', '(', '(', '(', ')', '('))
   - Position 7: Balance = 1 (('(', '(', '(', '(', ')', '(', ')'))
   - Position 8: Balance = 0 (('(', '(', '(', '(', ')', '(', ')', ')'))

   Dictionary `d` will be:
   ```
   {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 1, 8: 0}
   ```

2. **Remove Last Entry and Sort:**
   - Remove `d.pop(8)` to get `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 1}`.
   - Sort the dictionary items: 
     - By balance: `{1: 1, 3: 1, 7: 1, 2: 2, 6: 2, 4: 2, 5: 3}`
     - By position: `{7: 1, 3: 1, 1: 1, 6: 2, 2: 2, 4: 2, 5: 3}`

3. **Construct Result String:**
   - Append characters from `s` based on sorted positions:
     - Position 7: `)`
     - Position 3: `)`
     - Position 1: `(`
     - Position 6: `)`
     - Position 2: `(`
     - Position 4: `(`
     - Position 5: `)`

   Result: `()(()())`
