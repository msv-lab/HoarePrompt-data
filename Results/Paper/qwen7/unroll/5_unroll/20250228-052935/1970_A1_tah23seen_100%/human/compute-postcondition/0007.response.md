Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary where each key from 0 to n-1 (inclusive) contains an integer value representing the balance of "(" and ")" up to that index in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `d.pop(n)` removes the key `n` from the dictionary `d`. Since `n` is the length of the string `s`, the key `n` does not exist in the dictionary before the pop operation, but the operation itself does not affect the existence of keys from 0 to `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
