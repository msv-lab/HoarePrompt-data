Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation. Here are the issues:

1. **Sorting Key**: The sorting key should consider the balance of the prefix and the position in descending order for ties. However, the current implementation sorts the keys directly without considering the position in descending order for ties.
   
2. **Balance Calculation**: The balance calculation is correct, but the final step where the sorted dictionary is used to construct the result sequence is flawed. The dictionary `d` is being sorted by its values and keys, but the required output is based on the original positions of the characters in the string.

### Correct Implementation:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = []
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    balance = 0
    
    # Calculate balance at each position
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        d[i + 1] = balance
    
    # Sort the positions based on balance and then by position in descending order
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]), reverse=True)
    
    # Construct the balanced shuffle sequence
    for (pos, bal) in d:
        ans.append(s[pos - 1])
    
    return ''.join(ans)

n = input()
print(func_1(n))
```

This corrected version ensures that the positions are sorted according to the balance and the position in descending order for ties, and then constructs the balanced shuffle sequence accordingly.
