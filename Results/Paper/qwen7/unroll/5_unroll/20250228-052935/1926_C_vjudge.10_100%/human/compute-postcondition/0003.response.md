Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1 (as specified in the range function `range(1, inf)`).

3. **Understand the condition for loop execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `inf` (which is 200001).

4. **Check if the initial state allows the loop to start**: Since `i` is initially set to 1 and `inf` is 200001, `i` is indeed less than `inf`, so the loop can start executing.

Given this analysis, no adjustments are necessary for the initial state because the loop can start with the given values of `t`, `n`, `inf`, and `values`.

However, since we need to provide a state that ensures the loop can execute, we can summarize the relevant parts of the state:

- The loop can start with `i` being 1 and `inf` being 200001.

Thus, the state before the loop starts remains unchanged for the loop to execute.

**State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 1**
