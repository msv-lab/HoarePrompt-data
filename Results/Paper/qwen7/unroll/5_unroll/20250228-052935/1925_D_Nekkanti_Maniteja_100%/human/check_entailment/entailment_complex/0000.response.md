Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case, which are used to calculate the expected value.

2. **Computation of Constant `c`**:
   - The constant `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is necessary for the calculation of the expected value.
   - The formula for `c` is correct: \(c = \left(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\right)^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

3. **Summation Calculation**:
   - The variable `a` accumulates the sum of friendship values for all friend pairs.
   - The main summation loop iterates `k` times, updating `s` using the formula \(s = s + c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a\).
   - This formula is derived from the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The final result `s` is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct to handle large numbers and ensure the result fits within standard integer limits.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the correct logic and calculations as described in the problem statement. There are no apparent errors in the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
