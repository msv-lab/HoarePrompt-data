Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5. Additionally, a is an integer, s is an integer calculated as \(s = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a)\) where \(c = (n \cdot (n - 1) // 2)^{-1} \mod M\) and M is \(10^9 + 7\). The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
