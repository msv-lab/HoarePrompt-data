Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program does not account for the probability of choosing each pair during the excursions. Instead, it calculates a constant value `c` which is the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, and uses it to compute the result without considering the actual probabilities and the initial friendship values.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

1. Calculate the probability of choosing a specific pair in each excursion.
2. Use the expected value formula to account for the increase in friendship values over the k excursions.

Here's a brief outline of how the correct solution should work:

1. For each pair of friends, calculate the probability of choosing that pair in each excursion.
2. Update the friendship values accordingly.
3. Compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen.

The given program does not implement these steps correctly. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for certain inputs.
