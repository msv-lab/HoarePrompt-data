### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the requirements of the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
- Each pair of friends' friendship value increases by 1 for each excursion they are chosen.
- The friendship value of pairs who are not friends remains 0 and does not change.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, which is \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\).

2. **Main Loop**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the number of children `n`, pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`.
   - It initializes `s` to 0 and `a` to 0.
   - For each friend pair `(u, v, f)`, it adds the friendship value `f` to `a`.
   - In the outer loop, it iterates `k` times and updates `s` using the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.

#### Issues with the Given Program:
1. **Probability Consideration**: The program does not account for the probability of choosing each pair during the excursions. Instead, it assumes a constant value `c` and multiplies it by `i` and `m`, which does not reflect the actual expected value calculation.
2. **Friendship Value Increase**: The program incorrectly assumes that the friendship value of a pair increases linearly with each excursion, but it does not properly handle the probability of choosing each pair.
3. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value should be calculated based on the probability of choosing each pair and the increase in friendship values. The current implementation does not capture this.

#### Correct Solution Outline:
1. **Calculate Probabilities**: For each pair, calculate the probability of being chosen in each excursion.
2. **Expected Value Calculation**: Use the expected value formula to account for the increase in friendship values over the k excursions.
3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Ensure all calculations are done modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the probability of choosing each pair and the increase in friendship values over the k excursions.
