### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Let's break down why the provided program is incorrect and how it should be fixed.

#### Issues with the Given Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` used in the program does not correctly represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
   - Specifically, the term `c * i * c * m` is incorrect because it does not account for the probability of each pair being chosen and the expected increase in friendship value.

2. **Probability of Choosing a Pair:**
   - The probability of choosing a specific pair of friends in any single excursion is \(\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
   - Over `k` excursions, the expected increase in the friendship value for a specific pair is \(\frac{k}{n(n-1)}\).

3. **Correct Formula:**
   - For each pair of friends, the expected increase in the friendship value is \(\frac{k}{n(n-1)} \times f_i\), where \(f_i\) is the initial friendship value.
   - Summing this over all pairs gives the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen in `k` excursions.

#### Correct Implementation:

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Calculate the expected increase in friendship value for each pair of friends.
2. Sum these expected values to get the overall expected value of the sum of friendship values.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            s += f
        expected_value = (k * s * c) % M
        print(expected_value)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - `s` is initialized to 0, which will accumulate the sum of friendship values.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, iterate through the `m` pairs of friends.
   - Add the friendship value `f` to `s`.

4. **Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values is calculated as \((k \times s \times c) \mod M\).

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The result `expected_value` is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) before printing.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula to calculate the expected value. The corrected program uses the correct formula to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
