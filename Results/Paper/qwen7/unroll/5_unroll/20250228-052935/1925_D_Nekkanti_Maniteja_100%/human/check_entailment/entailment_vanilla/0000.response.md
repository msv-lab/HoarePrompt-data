Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads `m` pairs of friends and their corresponding friendship values.

2. **Calculating the Expected Value:**
   - The program calculates the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs using `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`. This is correct because it computes the modular inverse of the total number of pairs.
   - It initializes `s` to 0 and `a` to 0.
   - It sums up the friendship values of all the given pairs in `a`.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program then iterates `k` times to simulate the excursions.
   - In each iteration, it updates `s` using the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - Finally, it prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Formula for Expected Value:**
   - The formula used in the program `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. The expected value calculation should consider the probability of picking each pair and the effect of the friendship value increasing over time.
   - The correct approach involves calculating the expected increase in friendship value for each pair over `k` excursions.

2. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The program correctly uses modular arithmetic with \(10^9 + 7\), but the way it combines terms might lead to incorrect results due to the incorrect formula.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. The correct formula involves considering the probability of picking each pair and the effect of the friendship value increasing over time.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the provided program, the current implementation is incorrect. The formula used for updating `s` does not accurately reflect the expected value calculation as per the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
