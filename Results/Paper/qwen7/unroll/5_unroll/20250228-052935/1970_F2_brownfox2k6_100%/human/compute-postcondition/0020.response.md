Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `obj` containing two integers representing a position on a field and a direction `d` as a string ('U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'). It updates the position in `obj` based on the direction and returns the updated position. If `d` is 'U', the first element of `obj` is decremented by 1. If `d` is 'D', the first element is incremented by 1. If `d` is 'L', the second element is decremented by 1. If `d` is 'R', the second element is incremented by 1. After executing the function, `obj` will represent the new position on the field.**
