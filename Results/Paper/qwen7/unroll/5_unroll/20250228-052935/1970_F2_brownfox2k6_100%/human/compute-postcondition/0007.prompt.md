You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the current time (step) in the game, player is a dictionary mapping player identifiers (strings like 'R0', 'B0') to their current positions (a list of two integers [x, y]), and blud is a list of positions (a list of two integers [x, y]) representing the Bludgers on the field.
def func_2(t):
    out = []
    for p in player:
        if player[p] == blud:
            out.append(p)
            player[p] = [-1, -1]
        
    #State: Output State: `out` is a list containing player identifiers of those players whose positions matched any position in the `blud` list, and their positions in the `player` dictionary are updated to `[-1, -1]`. All other players and the `blud` list remain unchanged.
    for p in sorted(out):
        print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
        
    #State: The list `out` contains player identifiers of those players whose positions matched any position in the `blud` list, and for each of these players, their positions in the `player` dictionary are updated to `[-1, -1]`. The loop prints each eliminated player's identifier along with the string 'ELIMINATED' in the sorted order of player identifiers. All other players and the `blud` list remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the current time in the game, a dictionary `player` mapping player identifiers to their positions, and a list `blud` of Bludger positions. Depending on the inputs, it does not return a specific value but processes the current state of players and Bludgers at time `t`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
