The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `obj`, which is a list of two integers representing a position on the field, and `d`, which is a string representing a direction ('U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'). Based on the direction `d`, the function modifies the position `obj` accordingly and returns the updated position. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `obj` of two integers representing a position on the field and a direction `d` as a string ('U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'). It updates the position based on the direction and returns the updated position.**
