N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N, M are odd. obj is a string representing an entity on the field, and d is a string indicating the direction of movement ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'). The field is represented as a list of strings, where each string contains M characters, and the list has N strings. The field contains goals for two teams (RG and BG), players (R0-R9 and B0-B9), the Quaffle (.Q), and optionally one Bludger (.B). The number of steps T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000.
