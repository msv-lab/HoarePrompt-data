Reasoning:
1. **Initialization**: The program correctly initializes the field, players, goals, and the ball. The positions of the players, goals, and the ball are stored appropriately.
2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the number of steps `T` and processes each step according to the rules provided. The actions (moving, catching, throwing) are processed correctly.
3. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly updates the position of an object (player or ball) based on the direction specified. The logic for updating the position is correct and covers all possible directions.
4. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly identifies and eliminates players who are in the same position as a Bludger. The players are removed from the `player` dictionary and the appropriate messages are printed. The sorting of player identifiers ensures that the elimination messages are printed in the correct order.
5. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic is implemented correctly. When a player throws the Quaffle into the opponent's goal, the appropriate team scores a point, and the Quaffle is moved to the center of the field.
6. **Final Score Output**: The final score is correctly printed at the end of the game.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the rules and correctly implements the logic for the game.

Correctness: **True**
