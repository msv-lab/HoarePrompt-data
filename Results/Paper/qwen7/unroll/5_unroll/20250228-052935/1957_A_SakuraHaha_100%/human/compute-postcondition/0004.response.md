Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for x in a:`. The objects involved here are `x` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `x` will take on the values from the list `a` one by one during each iteration of the loop.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `a`.
   - Initially, `a` is a list of integers, and since it is derived from splitting a string and converting elements, it must contain at least one integer for the loop to start executing.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `x` will take on the values from `a`, we don't need to specify its initial value explicitly (it will change with each iteration).
   - We need to ensure that `a` has at least one element for the loop to start.

Given the above points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `a` having at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `cnt` is an empty dictionary**
