#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list of stick lengths a_1, a_2, ..., a_n consists of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is the sum of the counts of each integer in `a` divided by 3, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the counts of each integer in the list `a` divided by 3)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of stick lengths and calculates the total number of groups of three sticks that can be formed from the list. It prints the result, which is the sum of the counts of each stick length in the list divided by 3. The function does not accept any explicit parameters and does not return any value.
