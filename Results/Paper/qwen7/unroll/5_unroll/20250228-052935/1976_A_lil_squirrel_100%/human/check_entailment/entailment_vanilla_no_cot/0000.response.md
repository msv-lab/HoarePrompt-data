Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password meets the specified conditions for being strong. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Password Validation**:
   - It separates the characters into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits.
   - It checks if both `letters` and `digits` are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It ensures that there are no digits coming after letters by iterating through the password and checking the order of characters.
3. **Output**: Based on the validation, it prints "YES" if the password is strong and "NO" otherwise.

Given the problem description and the example provided, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required logic to validate the passwords according to the specified conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
