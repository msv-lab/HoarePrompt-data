### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Processing Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Separating Characters into Letters and Digits:**
   - The program correctly separates the characters into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
   - This part of the program is also correct.

3. **Checking Sorted Order of Letters:**
   - The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order using `sorted(letters)`.
   - If the `letters` list is not sorted, the program returns 'NO'.
   - This check is correct and ensures that all letters are in non-decreasing order.

4. **Checking Sorted Order of Digits:**
   - The program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order using `sorted(digits)`.
   - If the `digits` list is not sorted, the program returns 'NO'.
   - This check is correct and ensures that all digits are in non-decreasing order.

5. **Ensuring No Digit Follows a Letter:**
   - The program iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter.
   - If it finds a digit immediately following a letter, it returns 'NO'.
   - This check is correct and ensures that no digit comes after a letter.

6. **Returning 'YES' if All Conditions Are Met:**
   - If all the above conditions are satisfied, the program returns 'YES'.
   - This part of the program is correct and ensures that the password meets all the specified criteria.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to verify if a password is strong according to the given conditions. The original assessment accurately describes the functionality and correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
