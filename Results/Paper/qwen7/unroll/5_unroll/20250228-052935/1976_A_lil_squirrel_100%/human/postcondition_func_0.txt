The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer where 1 <= n <= 20, and `password`, a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It separates the password into letters and digits, checks if the first and last letters are the same, if the digits are sorted, and if there are no adjacent characters where a letter is followed immediately by a digit. If any of these conditions fail, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.
