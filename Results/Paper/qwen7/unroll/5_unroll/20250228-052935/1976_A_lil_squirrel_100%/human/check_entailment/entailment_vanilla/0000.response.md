Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each password, it separates the characters into two lists: one for letters and one for digits.
3. It checks if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
4. It checks if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
5. It iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. If this condition is violated, it returns 'NO'.
6. If all conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly follows the rules specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
