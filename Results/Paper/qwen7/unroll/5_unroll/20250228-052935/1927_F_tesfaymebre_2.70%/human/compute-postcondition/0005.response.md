Functionality: **The function processes a specified number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `m` lines of three integers `u`, `v`, and `w` representing edges in a graph. After processing all test cases, it sets `test_cases` to 0. The function does not return any value.**
