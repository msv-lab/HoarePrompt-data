Output State: **`colors[curr]` is set to 2, `curr` is unchanged, `parent` is unchanged, `path` includes `curr` appended to it, `res` is an empty list or contains a list of nodes forming a cycle if one is found during the DFS traversal.**

In this output state, the color of the node `curr` is marked as gray (represented by 2) in the `colors` dictionary. The `parent`, `path`, and `res` variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The `path` now includes the node `curr` since it was appended to it during the DFS traversal.
