Functionality: **The function processes a graph represented by weighted edges and a disjoint set union (DSU) data structure. It first constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph and a list of edges sorted in descending order by weight. Then, it uses Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum weight edge that connects two nodes already belonging to the same connected component, updating the DSU structure accordingly. After identifying this edge, it performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the nodes involved in this edge to determine a path. Finally, it prints the weight of the identified edge and the sequence of nodes visited during the DFS traversal. If no such edge exists, it prints infinity and an empty list.**
