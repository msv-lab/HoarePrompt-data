Output State: **colors and curr are unchanged, parent is unchanged, path is a list representing the current path being explored with curr appended to it, res is an empty list or contains a list of nodes forming a cycle if one is found during the DFS traversal.**

This means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the `colors` dictionary and `curr` variable remain in their initial states. The `parent` variable also remains unchanged. The `path` list continues to represent the current path being explored, with `curr` appended to it. The `res` variable will either be an empty list if no cycle is found, or it will contain a list of nodes forming a cycle if one is detected during the DFS traversal.
