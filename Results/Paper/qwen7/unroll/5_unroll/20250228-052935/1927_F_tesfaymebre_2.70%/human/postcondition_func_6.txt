The function `dfs` accepts three parameters: an integer `curr` representing the current vertex, an integer `parent` representing the parent vertex in the DFS traversal, and a list `path` representing the current path being explored. It performs a depth-first search to explore the graph. If the current vertex `curr` has a color of 1, the function returns the current path `path`. Otherwise, it continues exploring the graph and returns an empty list if no cycle is found or if the current vertex leads to no valid path.
