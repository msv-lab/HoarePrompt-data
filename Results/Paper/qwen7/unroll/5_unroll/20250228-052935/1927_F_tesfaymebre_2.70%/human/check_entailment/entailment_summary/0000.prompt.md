Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function processes a graph represented by weighted edges and a disjoint set union (DSU) data structure. It first constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph and a list of edges sorted in descending order by weight. Then, it uses Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum weight edge that connects two nodes already belonging to the same connected component, updating the DSU structure accordingly. After identifying this edge, it performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the nodes involved in this edge to determine a path. Finally, it prints the weight of the identified edge and the sequence of nodes visited during the DFS traversal. If no such edge exists, it prints infinity and an empty list.

''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `dfs` accepts three parameters: an integer `curr` representing the current vertex, an integer `parent` representing the parent vertex in the DFS traversal, and a list `path` representing the current path being explored. It performs a depth-first search to explore the graph. If the current vertex `curr` has a color of 1, the function returns the current path `path`. Otherwise, it continues exploring the graph and returns an empty list if no cycle is found or if the current vertex leads to no valid path.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):

 Output hints for function8:  The function processes a specified number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `m` lines of three integers `u`, `v`, and `w` representing edges in a graph. After processing all test cases, it sets `test_cases` to 0. The function does not return any value.
