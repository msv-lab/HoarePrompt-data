Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and all other variables retain their initial states.**

Explanation: The code `num_tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. This integer is specified to be between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The initial states of `t` and the list `a` remain unchanged. The variable `n` is not yet assigned a value in this snippet.
