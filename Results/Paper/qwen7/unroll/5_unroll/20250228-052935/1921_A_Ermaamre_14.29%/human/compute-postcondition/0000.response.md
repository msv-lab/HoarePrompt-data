Output State: **`a` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ a ≤ 100)**.

This code snippet reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases. The value of `a` is directly assigned from user input, and it is guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to 100. All other information about the test cases, such as the coordinates of the squares, remains unchanged and will be processed in subsequent steps of the program.
