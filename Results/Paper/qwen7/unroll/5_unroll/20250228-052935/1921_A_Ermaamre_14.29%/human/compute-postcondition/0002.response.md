Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers, each representing the squared distance between two pairs of points. For each iteration of the loop, the program calculates the vertical distance between two pairs of points based on their x-coordinates and prints the square of this distance. If the x-coordinates of the points do not match in the specified pairs, the result for that iteration will be 0.
