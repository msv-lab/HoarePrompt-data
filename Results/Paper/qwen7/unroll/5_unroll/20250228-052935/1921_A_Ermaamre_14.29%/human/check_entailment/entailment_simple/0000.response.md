Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by identifying the side length of the square using the coordinates of its corners. However, there are several issues with the logic and approach used in the code:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Sides**: The code checks for specific configurations of points to identify which points belong to the same side of the square. This is overly complex and not robust. A more straightforward approach would be to calculate the distances between all pairs of points and identify the unique distances, which should correspond to the side length of the square.

2. **Missing Calculation of Distances**: The code does not actually compute the distances between the points to determine the side length of the square. Instead, it relies on comparing x and y coordinates in a way that doesn't guarantee the correct identification of the side length.

3. **Assumption of Order**: The code assumes a specific order of the points, which is not guaranteed by the problem statement. The points could be in any order, and the code needs to handle this generically.

4. **Potential Incorrect Output**: Even if the logic were correct, the current implementation only calculates the difference in y-coordinates under certain conditions, which might not always give the correct side length of the square.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
