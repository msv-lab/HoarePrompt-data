### Reasoning:

The original assessment provided a detailed breakdown of the program's steps and concluded that the program is correct. Let's review the key points and verify them against the annotated code:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is correct and handles multiple test cases efficiently.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program correctly extracts the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` with the value of the first periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` is used to find the next multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`. This formula is correct because:
     - `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1)` ensures that we start from the year immediately after `last_year`.
     - The division and multiplication ensure that we get the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.

4. **Storing Results:**
   - The calculated year for the nth sign is stored in the `results` list. This is correct as it captures the required year for the nth sign.

5. **Outputting Results:**
   - The program correctly formats the results by joining them with newlines and writing them to the standard output.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations provided, the program indeed follows the logic described in the problem statement accurately. There are no logical errors or inconsistencies noted in the code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
