Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a list `a` containing `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). For each test case, it processes the list `a` based on the values of `t` and `n` and returns a result for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. The function processes the list `a` according to the rules defined by `t` and `n`, and returns a result for each test case.
