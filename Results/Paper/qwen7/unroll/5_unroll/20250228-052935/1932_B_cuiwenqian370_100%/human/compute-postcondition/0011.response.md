Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the list `a`), and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a final value `last_year` based on the initial value of `a[0]` and subsequent values in the list `a`. It then appends the final `last_year` value as a string to the `results` list. After processing all test cases, it writes the final results, each on a new line, to the standard output.**
