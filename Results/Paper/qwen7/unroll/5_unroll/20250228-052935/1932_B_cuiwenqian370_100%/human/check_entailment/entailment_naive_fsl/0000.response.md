Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur. Specifically, the logic for calculating the next year when the next sign will occur is flawed. The current implementation uses `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` to find the next multiple of `a[i]` after `last_year`, but this approach does not guarantee that the next sign will occur strictly after the previous one.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```
The correct sequence of years would be:
- First sign in year 3.
- Second sign in year 4.
- Third sign in year 8.
- Fourth sign in year 10.
- Fifth sign in year 18.
- Sixth sign in year 36.

However, the program's logic might incorrectly skip intermediate years, leading to an incorrect result. For instance, if the program incorrectly calculates the next year for the third sign as 7 instead of 8, it will produce an incorrect output.

To fix this, the program should ensure that the next year is strictly the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`. A corrected approach would be to use `next_year = (last_year // a[i] + 1) * a[i]`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        last_year = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            next_year = (last_year // a[i] + 1) * a[i]
            last_year = next_year
        results.append(str(last_year))
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
```

This corrected version ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`, thus correctly following the problem description.
