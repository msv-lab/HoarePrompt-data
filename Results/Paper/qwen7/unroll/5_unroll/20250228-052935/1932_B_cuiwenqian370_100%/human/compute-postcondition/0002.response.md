Output State: **`index` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list containing `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using whitespace as the delimiter.**

The code initializes the variable `index` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `data`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
