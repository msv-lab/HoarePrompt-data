Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. The logic in `func_1` does not accurately simulate the sequential waiting period for each sign. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Next Year**: The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` is not appropriate for finding the next occurrence of the sign. This formula does not ensure that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

2. **Sequential Waiting Period**: The program should find the least common multiple (LCM) of the periods to ensure the signs occur sequentially. However, the current approach does not account for this correctly.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return abs(a*b) // math.gcd(a, b)

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        # Calculate LCM of all periods
        result = reduce(lcm, a)
        results.append(str(result))
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

This corrected version uses the `lcm` function to compute the least common multiple of all the periods, ensuring that the signs occur sequentially at the correct year.
