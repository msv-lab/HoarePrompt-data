### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program and verify each part against the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through this list to extract the necessary values for each test case.
   - This is correct and handles the input as expected.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` with the value of the first periodicity `a[0]`.
   - This is correct and sets up the initial condition for the first sign.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
   - This formula ensures that the next year is a multiple of `a[i]` and is strictly greater than `last_year`.
   - Specifically:
     - `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1)` ensures that we start from the year immediately after `last_year`.
     - The division and multiplication ensure that we get the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.
   - This is correct and ensures that the next year is calculated properly.

4. **Storing Results:**
   - The calculated year for the nth sign is stored in the `results` list.
   - This is correct and stores the final result for each test case.

5. **Outputting Results:**
   - Finally, it joins the results and writes them to the standard output.
   - This is correct and formats the output as required.

### Detailed Check:

- **Input Handling:** The program correctly reads the input and processes it in chunks for each test case.
- **Year Calculation:** The formula used to calculate the next year is correct and ensures that the next year is a multiple of the current periodicity and strictly greater than the previous year.
- **Multiple Test Cases:** The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over them and processing each one separately.
- **Output Formatting:** The output is formatted correctly, with each result separated by a newline.

Given the detailed analysis and the correctness of each step, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
