Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the input for each test case, including the number of participants `n`, the number of screenshots `m`, and the contents of the screenshots.

2. **Initial Checks**: The function handles the simple case where `m == 1` correctly by printing 'yes' since a single screenshot always matches the original order.

3. **Comparing Screenshot Orders**: The function compares the orders of the first two screenshots (`l1` and `l2`). If they do not match, it prints 'no' immediately. This is correct because if the initial comparison fails, no subsequent operations can make the orders consistent.

4. **Finding Insertion Points**: The function attempts to find the correct insertion points for the missing elements in the orders. It correctly identifies the positions where the missing elements should be inserted to match the other order.

5. **Handling Multiple Screenshots**: The function correctly handles multiple screenshots by checking if the subsequent orders match the modified order after inserting the necessary elements. This ensures that all screenshots can be aligned to a common order.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as when the insertion points are equal and additional screenshots need to be checked. It correctly determines the order by comparing the elements in the subsequent screenshots.

Given the detailed analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if there is a consistent order that all screenshots correspond to.

Correctness: **True**
