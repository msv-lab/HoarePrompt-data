Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes three parameters: t (a positive integer), n (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and k (a positive integer such that n⋅k ≤ 2⋅10^5). Additionally, each test case contains a list of n distinct integers ranging from 1 to n, and all authors of these screenshots are unique across all test cases. The function returns information based on these inputs, likely related to the processing or analysis of the screenshots and their authors.**
