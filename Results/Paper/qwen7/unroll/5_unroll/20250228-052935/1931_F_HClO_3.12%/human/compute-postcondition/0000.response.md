Output State: **`t` is an input integer**.

The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state of `t` was a positive integer, after executing the code, `t` now holds the value of the input integer provided by the user. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer is still valid, but now `t` specifically holds the value of the input integer.
