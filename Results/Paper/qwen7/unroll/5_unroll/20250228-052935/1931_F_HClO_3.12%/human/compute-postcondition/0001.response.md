State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` in the expression `range(t)`.
2. For the loop to execute, the value of `t` must be a non-negative integer, but more specifically, it must be greater than 0 because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`. If `t` is 0 or negative, the sequence will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
3. The initial state of `t` being an input integer does not guarantee that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
