The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of positive integers \(t\), \(n\), and \(m\), along with two lists of \(n\) distinct integers. It checks if certain conditions are met across these lists and inserts specific values to ensure the lists match. If all conditions are satisfied, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not return any value but outputs 'yes' or 'no' based on the logic executed within the test cases.
