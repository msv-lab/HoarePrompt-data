Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program reads the input in a way that does not match the problem description. The problem description states that each test case starts with an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by the details of each test case. However, the provided program does not read `t` and processes all inputs as a single test case.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. The program reads `n` as a string and then converts it to an integer using `int(n)`, which is incorrect because `n` should be read directly as an integer.
2. The program reads the next line as a string `a` and then splits it into a list of strings, converting them to integers. This is unnecessary and incorrect.
3. The program sorts the list and then sums every other element starting from the first element, which is not the optimal strategy for maximizing the score.

To correctly implement the solution, the program should:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, read `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. Sort the list and sum the first `n` elements (which are the smallest `n` elements after sorting).

Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    i = 0
    t = int(data[i])
    i += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[i])
        i += 1
        nums = list(map(int, data[i:i + 2 * n]))
        i += 2 * n
        
        nums.sort()
        score = sum(nums[:n])
        results.append(score)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This corrected version properly handles the input and implements the optimal strategy to maximize the score.
