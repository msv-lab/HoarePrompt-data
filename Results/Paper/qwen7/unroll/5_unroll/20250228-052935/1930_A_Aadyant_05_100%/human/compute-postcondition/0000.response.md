Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = input()` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial conditions for `t` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` remain unchanged.
