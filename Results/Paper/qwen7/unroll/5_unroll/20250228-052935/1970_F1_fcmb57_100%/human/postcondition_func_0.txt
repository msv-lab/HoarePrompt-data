The function `func_1` takes two tuples `a` and `b` as input parameters. It assigns the first element of `a` to `x` and the first element of `b` to `dx`. Similarly, it assigns the second element of `a` to `y` and the second element of `b` to `dy`. However, `dy` is not used further in the function. The function then returns `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`.
