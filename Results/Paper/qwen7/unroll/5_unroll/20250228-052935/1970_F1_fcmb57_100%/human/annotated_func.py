#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field respectively, where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of strings, each string containing M characters describing a row of the field. The list has N such strings. The field contains goals for the two teams (RG for a red goal and BG for a blue goal), players (R0-R9 for red team and B0-B9 for blue team), and exactly one Quaffle (.Q). The number of players P satisfies 1 ≤ P ≤ 10. The number of steps T satisfies 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns x which is assigned to a, and dx which is b, and y which is assigned to b, and dy which is undefined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two tuples `a` and `b` as input parameters. It assigns the first element of `a` to `x` and the first element of `b` to `dx`. Similarly, it assigns the second element of `a` to `y` and the second element of `b` to `dy`. However, `dy` is not used further in the function. The function then returns `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`.
