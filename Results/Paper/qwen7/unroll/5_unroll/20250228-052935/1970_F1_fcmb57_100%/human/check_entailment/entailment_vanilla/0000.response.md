Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the initial grid and extracts the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle. It also correctly identifies the number of moves to be processed.
2. **Movement Handling**: The program handles player movements correctly using the `func_1` function, which updates the player's position based on the movement direction.
3. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic is implemented correctly. When a player throws the Quaffle into their opponent's goal, the corresponding team's score is incremented, and the appropriate message is printed.
4. **Output Format**: The program prints the score updates and the final score in the required format.

Given the above points, the provided program appears to handle the problem statement correctly without any apparent logical errors.

Correctness: **True**
