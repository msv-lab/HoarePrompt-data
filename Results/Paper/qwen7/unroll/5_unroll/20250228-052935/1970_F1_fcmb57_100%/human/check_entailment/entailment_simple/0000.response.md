Reasoning:
1. The `func_1` function is supposed to update the coordinates of a player based on the direction of movement.
2. However, the function currently returns `x + dx, y + dy`, but it does not actually update the player's position in the `players` dictionary.
3. The function should update the position of the player in the `players` dictionary, but the current implementation does not do this.
4. Additionally, the function returns `dx` instead of updating `y` with `dy`.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly update the player's position in the `players` dictionary, which means the program logic will not work as intended.

Correctness: **False**

The function needs to be corrected to properly update the player's position in the `players` dictionary. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    new_x = x + dx
    new_y = y + dy
    return (new_x, new_y)
```

And then update the player's position in the `players` dictionary:

```python
if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
    players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
```

With these corrections, the program should work as intended.
