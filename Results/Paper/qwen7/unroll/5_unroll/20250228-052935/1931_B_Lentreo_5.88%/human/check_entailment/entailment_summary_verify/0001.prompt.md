You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` indicating the number of cases, followed by an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers. It calculates the cumulative sum of the differences between consecutive non-zero numbers in the list. If this cumulative sum is zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container index is always less than the destination container index.

2. **Key Insight**: The key observation here is that the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). This means that if we can distribute the water equally among all containers, each container should end up with `total_water / n` units of water.

3. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water units `nums`.
   - It calculates the difference between the last element (`last`) and each element in `nums`, accumulating these differences in `curr`.
   - If `curr` is zero, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

4. **Flaw in the Given Solution**:
   - The logic in the given solution is flawed. It does not correctly check if the water can be evenly distributed.
   - Specifically, the code sums the differences between each element and the last element, which does not reflect the actual distribution of water.
   - The correct approach would be to calculate the average water per container and check if redistributing the water according to the given operation can achieve this uniform distribution.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the average water per container, which is `total_water / n`.
   - Check if it's possible to redistribute the water such that each container has exactly this average amount.

### Conclusion:

The given solution is incorrect because it does not properly check if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
