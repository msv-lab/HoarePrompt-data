Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and we have read one line of input which contains the value of `t`.**

This means that the variable `t` has been updated to the integer value entered by the user, and it is constrained to be within the range of 1 to 10^4. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer remains valid, and now we know its exact value. The input for the next test case (`n` and the list of `a_i`) will be read in subsequent steps.
