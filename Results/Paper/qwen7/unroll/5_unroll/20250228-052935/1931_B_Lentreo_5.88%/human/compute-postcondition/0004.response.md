Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a list of `n` non-negative integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. It then returns whether for each test case, the given condition holds true.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it first reads an integer `t` indicating the number of subsequent test cases. Then, for each of these `t` test cases, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers. The function checks if the sum of these `n` integers is divisible by `n`. If the condition is met for all test cases, it returns a confirmation; otherwise, it indicates failure.
