Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The logic in the program checks if the difference between the last element and each other element sums to zero, which is not a valid approach.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
The program will calculate the differences and check if they sum to zero, but this does not guarantee that the containers can be made equal. A correct solution would involve checking if the average amount of water per container can be achieved by pouring water from higher to lower containers.

A correct implementation would involve calculating the average amount of water per container and checking if all containers can reach this average through the allowed operations. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_water = sum(nums)
        avg_water = total_water // n
        
        # Check if all containers can reach the average amount of water
        if all(a == avg_water for a in nums):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected version calculates the average amount of water per container and checks if all containers can reach this average, ensuring the program works correctly according to the problem description.
