State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will iterate `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
3. Given that `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive), the loop will execute if `t` is within this range.
4. The initial state of `t` being an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) does not guarantee that the loop will execute; it must be explicitly ensured that `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
