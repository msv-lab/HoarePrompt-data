Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether Nikita can end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This ensures that the number of moves can balance out to result in exactly `m` cubes. 

- If `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, it means that the difference between the number of moves added and removed can result in exactly `m` cubes.
- Otherwise, it is not possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Given the constraints and the logic used, the program handles all potential cases correctly.
