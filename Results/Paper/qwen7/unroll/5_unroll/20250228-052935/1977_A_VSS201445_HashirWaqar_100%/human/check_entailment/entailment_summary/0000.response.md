Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Conditions Check**: For each test case, it checks two conditions:
   - `n >= m`: This ensures that there are enough moves to potentially achieve `m` cubes.
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This condition ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even. Since each move either adds or removes one cube, the total change in the number of cubes must be even to reach `m` from 0.
3. **Output**: Based on these conditions, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
