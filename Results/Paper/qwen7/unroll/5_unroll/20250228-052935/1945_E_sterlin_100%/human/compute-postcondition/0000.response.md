Output State: **The program returns a list containing the split input string from the user, which includes the number of test cases 't', followed by pairs of integers 'n' and 'x', and a permutation 'p' of size 'n'.**

This means that the program will take an input from the user, split it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and return this list. The first element of the list will be the string representation of the integer 't', indicating the number of test cases. Each subsequent element will be a pair of integers 'n' and 'x' followed by a permutation 'p' of size 'n'.
