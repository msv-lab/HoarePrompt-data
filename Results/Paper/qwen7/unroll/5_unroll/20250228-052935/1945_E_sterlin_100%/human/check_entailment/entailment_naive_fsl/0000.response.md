Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any implementation of the required functionality. Instead, it defines several utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) that read input but do not perform the actual task of rearranging the permutation to make the binary search successful. 

To meet the problem description, the program needs to take a permutation and a number `x`, and perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that `p_l` equals `x` after the binary search. Since the program does not implement this logic, it fails to meet the requirements for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
