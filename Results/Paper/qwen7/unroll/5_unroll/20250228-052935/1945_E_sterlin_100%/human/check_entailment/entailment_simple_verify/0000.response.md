### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x` using `func_2()`, and the permutation `p` using `func_3()`.

2. **Mapping Indices:**
   - The program creates a dictionary `num_indx` that maps each number in the permutation to its index. This is useful for quickly finding the indices of specific numbers later.

3. **Binary Search Preparation:**
   - Two pointers `left` and `right` are initialized to 0 and `n+1` respectively.
   - The program performs a binary search to find the position where `x` should be placed. This is done by repeatedly checking the middle element `mid` and adjusting `left` and `right` accordingly.

4. **Swapping Elements:**
   - After the binary search loop, the program checks if `p[left]` is equal to `x`. If it is, no swaps are needed, and the program prints `0`.
   - If `p[left]` is not equal to `x`, the program checks if `x` has been seen in the permutation (`seen[x-1]`). If not, it prints `1` and swaps the elements at `left` and the index of `x` in `num_indx`.
   - If `x` has been seen, the program finds the first unseen element in the `seen` list and swaps it with `x` and then with `left`.

5. **Ensuring Correctness:**
   - The program ensures that the binary search is performed correctly and that the necessary swaps are made to place `x` at the correct position.
   - The logic for determining the swaps is sound and ensures that the binary search will work as intended.

Given the detailed analysis, the program does indeed implement the required functionality. It reads the input, performs the necessary swaps, and ensures that the binary search works correctly. The original assessment incorrectly states that the program does not contain the required functionality because it defines utility functions instead of directly implementing the logic in the main function. However, the annotated code clearly shows that the required logic is implemented within the main logic of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the annotated code.
