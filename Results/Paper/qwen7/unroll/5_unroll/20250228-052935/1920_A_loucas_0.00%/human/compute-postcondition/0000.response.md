Output State: **`loop` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `loop` ≤ 500.**

Explanation: The code `loop = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `loop`. The initial conditions for `t` and the constraints for `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged. The value of `loop` is now known and constrained between 1 and 500, inclusive.
