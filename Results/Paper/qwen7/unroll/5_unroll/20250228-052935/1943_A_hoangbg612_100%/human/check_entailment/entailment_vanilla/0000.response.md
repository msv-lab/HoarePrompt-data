Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the elements of the array `N`.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The array `N` is sorted. This step is unnecessary for solving the problem correctly since the order of elements does not affect the MEX calculation directly.

3. **Initialization**:
   - A variable `cur` is initialized to `-1`.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the count of each unique number in `N`.

4. **Processing the Array**:
   - The program iterates through each number in the sorted array `N`.
   - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - If the sum of counts in `M` equals the size of the array `S`, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` containing keys from `M` where the value is 1.
   - If there are at least two such keys, it sets `cur` to the second key in the list `cnt`.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cur`.

### Correctness Analysis

#### Key Points to Consider:
- **Objective**: The goal is to determine the optimal MEX value after both players have played their turns.
- **Optimal Strategy**: Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.

#### Issues in the Given Program:
1. **Sorting is Unnecessary**: Sorting the array `N` does not help in determining the MEX value. The order of elements in `N` does not matter for the MEX calculation.
2. **Logic for Updating `cur`**: The logic for updating `cur` is flawed. It should consider the sequence of moves made by both players rather than just the presence of numbers.
3. **Final Calculation**: The final calculation to set `cur` based on the dictionary `M` is also incorrect. It should consider the sequence of moves and the optimal strategy for both players.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
