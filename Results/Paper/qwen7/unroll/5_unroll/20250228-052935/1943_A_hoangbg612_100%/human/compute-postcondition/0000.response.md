Output State: **`T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2⋅10^4. The values of `t` and the conditions for `n` and `a` remain unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. The initial state of `t` being a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\) is preserved, but now `T` holds the specific value read from the input. The conditions for `n` and `a` remain unchanged, meaning `n` is still a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `a` is still a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
