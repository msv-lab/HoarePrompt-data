Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the range function arguments. In this case, the variable of interest is `T`, which determines how many times the loop will iterate.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute `T` times, where `T` is an input integer. Since `T` is given as an input integer where \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute if `T` is at least 1.

3. **Adjust the State**: The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `T`. It must be set to a value that ensures the loop will run, i.e., `T` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `T`.

**State: **`T` must be greater than or equal to 1**
