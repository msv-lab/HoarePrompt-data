The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers. For each test case, it sorts the list and then identifies the second smallest number that appears exactly once in the list. If no such number exists, it sets the result to -1. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.
