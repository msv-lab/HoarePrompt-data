Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Game Logic Misunderstanding**:
   - The program aims to find the second smallest number that appears exactly once in the sorted list `N`. However, the game involves two different rules for Alice and Bob, and the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of the resulting array `c`.
   - Alice always appends elements to her array `c` and removes them from `a`, while Bob only removes elements from `a`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**:
   - The program does not simulate the actual game process where Alice and Bob take turns according to their specific rules.
   - Instead, it focuses on finding the second smallest unique number in the sorted list, which does not align with the game's objective of determining the MEX of `c`.

3. **No Simulation of Turns**:
   - The program does not simulate the alternating turns between Alice and Bob, nor does it ensure that Alice maximizes and Bob minimizes the MEX as per their strategies.

4. **Output Mismatch**:
   - Given the examples provided, the output of the program does not match the expected results. For instance, in the first test case, the expected output is 2, but the program might produce a different result due to its incorrect logic.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and therefore cannot produce the correct MEX values for the given test cases.

Correctness: **False**
