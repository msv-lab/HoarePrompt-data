Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers, each representing the result of the operations performed within the loop for each test case. These integers are calculated based on the sorting and comparison operations between lists `a` and `c` for each test case. Specifically, the output for each test case will either be 0 (if certain conditions are met), or the sum of maximum absolute differences calculated during the sorting and comparison process.
