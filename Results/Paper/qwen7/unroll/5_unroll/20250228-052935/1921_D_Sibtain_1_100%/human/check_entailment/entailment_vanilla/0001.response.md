Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the total difference \(D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|\), where \(a_i\) is the original array and \(c_i\) is the chosen array from the set of integers \(b_i\).

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It then reads the array \(a\) of size \(n\).
   - Finally, it reads the array \(c\) of size \(m\).

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If both arrays \(a\) and \(c\) have the same unique value, the difference \(D\) will be zero. This is correctly handled by checking `if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and (a[0] == c[0]):`.

3. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - The array \(a\) is sorted in ascending order.
   - The array \(c\) is sorted in descending order.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The program uses two pointers, `i` and `j`, to traverse the sorted arrays.
   - For each element in \(a\), it calculates the absolute differences with the corresponding elements in \(c\) from both ends (smallest and largest remaining values in \(c\)).
   - It adds the maximum of these two differences to the total difference \(ans\).

5. **Handling Single Element Arrays:**
   - If \(a\) has only one element, it calculates the maximum difference between this element and the maximum and minimum elements in \(c\).

### Correctness Check
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where both arrays have the same unique value.
- **Sorting and Pointer Logic:**
  - Sorting \(a\) in ascending order and \(c\) in descending order ensures that the maximum possible differences are considered.
  - Using two pointers to traverse the arrays and choosing the maximum difference at each step is a valid approach to maximize the total difference.
- **Single Element Arrays:**
  - The handling for single-element arrays is also correct.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the total difference \(D\).

### Conclusion
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and examples.

**Correctness: **True**
