### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key insight that the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner. Let's break down the program step by step to ensure its correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` which contains two space-separated integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Parsing Input:**
   - The program splits the string `s` and converts the first and second elements to integers `a` and `b`.
   - This part is correct as long as the input format is strictly followed.

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The program checks if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Game Logic:**
  - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to either swap wallets or remove one coin from their current wallet.
  - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
  - Both players play optimally.

- **Key Insight:**
  - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves (if Alice removes a coin, Bob can also remove a coin and maintain the even sum).
  - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd, Alice can always force the sum to become even after her move, leaving Bob in a losing position.

- **Program Logic:**
  - The program correctly checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.
  - It prints 'Bob' if the sum is even and 'Alice' if the sum is odd, which aligns with the optimal strategy analysis.

### Verification:

- The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins in both wallets.
- The program handles all possible inputs within the specified constraints (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9).

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines the winner based on the given problem description and the optimal strategy analysis.

### Final Answer:

Final: **True**
