State: **`len_unique` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `char_map` is an empty dictionary** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(len_unique)`, which means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = len_unique - 1`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `len_unique` must be greater than 0. If `len_unique` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute at all.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
4. The variable `char_map` is mentioned to be an empty dictionary, and this state does not change based on the loop itself but is a precondition for the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `len_unique` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `char_map` is an empty dictionary.
