### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This part is correct and handles multiple test cases efficiently.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it correctly extracts the length `n` of the encoded string `b`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to decode the string `b`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Step 1: Extract Unique Characters**: It correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sorts them alphabetically.
     - This step is correct because it uses `set(encoded)` to get unique characters and `sorted()` to sort them alphabetically.
   - **Step 2: Create Mapping**:
     - It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted unique characters list is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character.
       - This step is also correct. The mapping is done by iterating over the sorted unique characters and mapping each character to its symmetric counterpart.
   - **Step 3: Decode String**:
     - It decodes the encoded string `b` using the `char_map` and returns the decoded string.
       - This step is correct. The decoding is done by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding value from the `char_map`.

4. **Output**:
   - The decoded strings are printed correctly.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement. The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code align with the steps and logic of the program.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly decodes the encoded strings according to the specified algorithm.

### Final:
**True**
