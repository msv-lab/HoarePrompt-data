Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `A` is undefined, `B` is undefined

Explanation: The provided code reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. For each test case, it calculates `ans = m // a + m // b + 2` and prints the result. However, since the initial state does not provide any specific values for `A` and `B`, and these variables are not used within the loop, their values remain undefined after the loop completes. The value of `t` remains the same as the initial value, as the loop only processes `t` test cases but does not modify `t` itself.
