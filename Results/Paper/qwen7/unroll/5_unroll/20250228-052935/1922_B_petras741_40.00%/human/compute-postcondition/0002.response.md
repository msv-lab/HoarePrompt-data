Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head consists of the variable `i` and the value `t`. The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables**:
   - `t` is an input integer.
   - `buffer` is an empty list.
   - For each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - A list contains `n` integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\).
   - The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\).

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - The loop will start with `i = 0`.
   - Since the loop will run `t` times, `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `t` must be at least 1.
- `i` will start at 0.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
