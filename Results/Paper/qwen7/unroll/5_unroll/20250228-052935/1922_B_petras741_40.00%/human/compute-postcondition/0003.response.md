Output State: **After executing all iterations, the output state will consist of a series of integers printed as the result of the loop's operations. For each test case, if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the program calculates a specific combinatorial value based on the frequency of unique elements in the list `w`. If `n` is less than 3, it prints 0. The final output state is a sequence of these calculated values for each test case.**
