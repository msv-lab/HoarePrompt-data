The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer t and a list of n integers. For each test case, it calculates a combinatorial value based on the frequency of unique elements in the list if n is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise, it prints 0. The function outputs a sequence of these calculated values for each test case.
