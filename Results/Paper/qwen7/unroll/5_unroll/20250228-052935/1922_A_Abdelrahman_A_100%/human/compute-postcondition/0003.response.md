Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses based on the conditions checked within the nested loops. For each test case (`i` in `range(tests)`), it checks if the string `c` contains any character that is not present in either `a` or `b`. If `c` matches `a` or `b`, it immediately prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it iterates through each character of `c` and checks if it exists in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`. If a character in `c` is not found in both `a` and `b` at the same position, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop. If no such character is found throughout the loop, it prints 'NO'.
