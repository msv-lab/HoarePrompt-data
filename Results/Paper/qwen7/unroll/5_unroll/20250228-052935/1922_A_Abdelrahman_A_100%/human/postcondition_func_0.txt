The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) of equal length \(n\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)). It then checks if \(c\) contains any character that is not present in either \(a\) or \(b\). If \(c\) matches \(a\) or \(b\), it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it iterates through each character of \(c\) and checks if it exists in the corresponding positions of \(a\) and \(b\). If a character in \(c\) is not found in both \(a\) and \(b\) at the same position, it prints 'YES' and stops further checks. If no such character is found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
