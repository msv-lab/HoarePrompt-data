Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `k` is less than `n-1`. According to the problem description, if `k` is less than `n-1`, Everule can still visit more than one island. However, the program incorrectly prints `1` for such cases. For example, consider the case `n=4` and `k=1`. In this scenario, destroying one bridge still allows Everule to visit at least two islands (e.g., by going through a third island). Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements for certain inputs.
