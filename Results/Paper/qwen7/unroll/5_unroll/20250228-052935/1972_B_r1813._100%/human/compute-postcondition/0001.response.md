Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using whitespace as the delimiter.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `s` remains a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". The new variable `data` is created and assigned the split result.
