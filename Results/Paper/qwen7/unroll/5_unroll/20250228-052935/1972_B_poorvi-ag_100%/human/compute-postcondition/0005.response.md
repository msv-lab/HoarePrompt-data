Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in results:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `results`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the `results` list. Therefore, the loop can execute as long as `results` is a non-empty list.

3. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state given is that `t` integers are appended to the `results` list. This means `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is an integer.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop will iterate over each element in `results`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `results`. The variable `i` will take on the value of each element in `results` during each iteration, but its initial value is not relevant to the loop's ability to execute.

5. **Formulate the Final State**: Given that `t` integers are appended to `results`, the list `results` must contain `t` elements. The variable `i` will take on these values one by one during the loop iterations.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`results` is a list of `t` integers**
