### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing optimally on an array \(a\) of size \(n\). Alice picks elements and appends them to her array \(c\), while Bob only removes elements. The goal is to determine the MEX of \(c\) at the end of the game.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Alice can always pick the smallest available element to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will remove elements to minimize the MEX.
   - The optimal strategy for Alice is to ensure that the smallest missing number (MEX) is maximized, and for Bob, it is to minimize this number.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \(N\) and the array itself.
   - The array \(N\) is sorted.
   - A dictionary \(M\) is used to count the occurrences of each number in \(N\).
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1 and iterates through the sorted array to determine the MEX.
   - If a number is greater than `cur`, it checks if the number is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it breaks the loop and increments `cur`.
   - Otherwise, it increments the count in the dictionary `M` for the current `cur`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic to determine the MEX is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly simulate the game's turns and does not account for the optimal strategies of both players.
   - The program does not handle the alternating turns between Alice and Bob correctly.
   - The program does not ensure that Alice picks the smallest available element and Bob removes the smallest available element.
   - The program does not properly update the dictionary `M` to reflect the removals by Bob.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game's rules and does not simulate the optimal strategies of both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
