Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the game's final score based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
2. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:
   - The program attempts to sort the array `N` and then iterates through it to determine the maximum number `cur` such that there are at least `cur+1` numbers in the array that are greater than or equal to `cur`.
   - This approach does not correctly simulate the game's rules, where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a` and appending/deleting them to/from their respective arrays `c` and `a`.
   - The program does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning they would try to maximize and minimize the MEX of `c`, respectively.
   - The program does not properly handle the turns between Alice and Bob, nor does it construct the array `c` as specified in the problem statement.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
