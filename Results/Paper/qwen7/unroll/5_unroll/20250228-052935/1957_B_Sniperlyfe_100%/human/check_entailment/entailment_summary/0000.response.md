Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
2. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1(n, k)` to generate the sequence of numbers and appends the result to `results`.
3. The function `func_1(n, k)` aims to construct a sequence of `n` integers such that their sum is `k` and the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.
4. The function initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
5. It sets the first element `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits. This step ensures that the first number contributes the maximum possible number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
6. It then iterates through the rest of the list, setting each element to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining value of `k`, ensuring the sum constraint is maintained.
7. Finally, it adjusts `nums[0]` to account for any remaining value of `k`.

This approach ensures that the sum of the sequence is `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. The logic appears sound and should produce correct outputs for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
