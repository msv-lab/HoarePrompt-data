Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` where `nums[0]` is `k`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `nums[i]` is the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and `k`. After each assignment, `k` is decremented by `nums[i]`**.

This means that the first element of the list `nums` is `k`, and each subsequent element is the minimum value between `k + 1` and `k`, with `k` being reduced by the value of the current element after each assignment.
