Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `nums` is a list of n zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `nums` with `n` zeros. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new list `nums` is created and its length is `n`, with all elements initialized to 0.
