Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to generate an array `nums` of length `n` such that the sum of elements equals `k` and the bitwise OR of all elements is maximized.
   - The function initializes `nums` with zeros.
   - It sets the first element `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits.
   - It subtracts this value from `k`.
   - For subsequent elements, it tries to add the smallest possible value that keeps the sum equal to `k` while maximizing the bitwise OR.
   - Finally, it adjusts the first element to ensure the sum constraint is met.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The initial value for `nums[0]` ensures that it uses the highest possible value within the bit length of `k`, which helps maximize the bitwise OR.
   - The subsequent values are set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` or the remaining value of `k`, ensuring that the sum constraint is maintained.
   - The final adjustment to `nums[0]` ensures that the total sum remains `k`.

### Testing the Functionality

Let's test the function with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `1 5`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Explanation: The only possible value is `5` since it is the largest number less than or equal to `5` that can be used.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `2 3`
   - Expected Output: `1 2`
   - Explanation: `1 | 2 = 3` and the sum is `1 + 2 = 3`. This is the optimal solution.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `2 5`
   - Expected Output: `5 0`
   - Explanation: `5 | 0 = 5` and the sum is `5 + 0 = 5`. This is the optimal solution.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `6 51`
   - Expected Output: `3 1 1 32 2 12`
   - Explanation: `3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 37` and the sum is `3 + 1 + 1 + 32 + 2 + 12 = 51`. This is the optimal solution.

### Conclusion

The provided function `func_1` correctly generates the required sequence for each test case, ensuring the sum constraint and maximizing the bitwise OR. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
