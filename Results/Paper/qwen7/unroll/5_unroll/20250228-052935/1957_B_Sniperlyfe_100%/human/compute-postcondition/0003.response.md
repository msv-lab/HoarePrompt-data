Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which ranges from 1 to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, the initial value of `i` should be set to 1.

3. **Determine the Value of `n`**: The value of `n` must be such that the loop can execute. The loop will run from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, so `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `k`, `nums`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we can summarize the necessary adjustments as follows:

- `i` should be set to 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
