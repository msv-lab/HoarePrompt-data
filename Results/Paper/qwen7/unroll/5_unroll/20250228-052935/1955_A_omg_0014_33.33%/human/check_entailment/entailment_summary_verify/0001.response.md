### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the optimal way to use the promotion when the number of yogurts is odd. Let's re-evaluate the program and the problem statement to confirm this.

#### Problem Statement Recap

The goal is to minimize the cost of buying `n` yogurts, where the cost of one yogurt is `a` and the cost of two yogurts is `b`. The program should consider both the regular price and the promotion price and choose the cheaper option.

#### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case by reading three integers `(a, b, c)`.

2. **Calculating Promotion Price per Yogurt:**
   - The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which is the price for one yogurt under the promotion.

3. **Comparison Logic:**
   - The program compares `a * b` (the total cost without promotion) with `a * d` (the total cost with promotion).
   - If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, it prints `a * b`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`.

#### Issues Identified

1. **Handling Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - The program does not account for the optimal way to use the promotion when `n` is odd. For example, if `n` is odd, it should buy `n-1` yogurts in pairs and the last one at the regular price to ensure the minimum cost.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Promotion Price:**
   - The variable `c` is used instead of `b` to calculate the promotion price. This is incorrect because `c` is not defined in the problem statement and should be replaced with `b`.

#### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the cost of buying `n` yogurts using the regular price.
2. Calculate the cost of buying `n` yogurts using the promotion price, considering the optimal way to use the promotion (buying pairs and handling the remainder).

Here is the corrected approach:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b, _) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost without promotion
        cost_without_promo = a * n
        # Calculate the cost with promotion
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        cost_with_promo = pairs * b + remaining * a
        # Print the minimum cost
        print(min(cost_without_promo, cost_with_promo))
```

This corrected version ensures that the program considers the optimal way to use the promotion, even when `n` is odd.

### Final Evaluation

Given the issues identified in the original program and the need to handle the optimal way to use the promotion, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
