Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates through each test case.
   - It reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` (Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions).
   - It reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks for Draw Condition:**
   - The program checks if both Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions have the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints 'Draw' and continues to the next test case.
   - This part is correct because if both start with the highest value, they will always end up with the same score, resulting in a draw.

3. **Tracking Moves and Scores:**
   - The program initializes two lists `b` and `s` to track the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It then iterates `k` times, updating the positions and scores based on the rules:
     - If Bodya's current position has the maximum value, it adds that value to `b` and updates the position.
     - If Sasha's current position has the maximum value, it adds that value to `s` and updates the position.
     - Otherwise, it adds the value at the current position to both `b` and `s` and updates the positions according to the permutation `p`.

4. **Calculating Final Scores:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums for both `b` and `s` to get the cumulative scores.
   - It then calculates the final scores for Bodya and Sasha considering the remaining turns.
   - Finally, it compares the maximum possible scores for both players and prints the result accordingly.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Handling of Maximum Value:**
   - The initial check for the maximum value in `a` only considers the starting positions. However, the problem requires checking the maximum value at each step during the game. The current implementation only checks the starting positions.
   - This can lead to incorrect results in scenarios where the maximum value changes during the game.

2. **Logic for Tracking Moves:**
   - The logic for tracking moves and updating positions is correct, but it assumes that the maximum value will always be at the starting positions. This assumption might not hold true throughout the game.
   - The program should consider the possibility that the maximum value might change during the game.

3. **Final Score Calculation:**
   - The final score calculation is based on the assumption that the maximum value remains constant throughout the game. This is not always true, especially when the maximum value changes due to the permutation.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly handle all edge cases and scenarios as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
