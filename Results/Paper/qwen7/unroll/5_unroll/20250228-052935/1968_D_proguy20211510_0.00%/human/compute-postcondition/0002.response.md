Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `MOD` is 1000000007; `alpha` is a string containing the alphabet 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; for each testcase, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `P_B`, `P_S` ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^9; `p` is a permutation of length `n`; `a` is an array of positive integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 for all i; `YES` is a string equal to 'YES'; `NO` is a string equal to 'NO'**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` to the variable `alpha`. No other variables are affected, so their initial states remain unchanged.
