Output State: The output state depends on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. For each test case, the output will be either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison of points accumulated by Bodya and Sasha over `k` rounds. The specific output for each test case is determined by the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, permutation `p`, and array `a`. Since the exact inputs are not provided, the output cannot be precisely calculated. However, the process involves comparing the maximum values in the array `a` and simulating the game rounds to determine the winner or if it's a draw.
