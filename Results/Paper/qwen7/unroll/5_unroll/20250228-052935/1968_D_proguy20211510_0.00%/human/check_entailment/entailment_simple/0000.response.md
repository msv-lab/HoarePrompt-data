Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for each test case, including \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), \( P_S \), the permutation \( p \), and the array \( a \).

2. **Max Value Check**: The program checks if the scores of Bodya and Sasha are equal to the maximum value in the array \( a \). If they are, it determines the outcome based on whose starting position corresponds to the maximum value. This handles the "Draw" condition correctly when both players start at the position with the highest score.

3. **Dynamic Scoring Calculation**: The program calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using a dynamic approach. It simulates the moves and scores for each turn, storing intermediate scores in lists `b` and `s`. This ensures that the scores are calculated accurately for each player.

4. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate the cumulative scores up to each turn. This helps in determining the final scores for both players.

5. **Final Score Comparison**: The program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha. If Bodya's score is higher, it prints "Bodya"; if Sasha's score is higher, it prints "Sasha"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".

6. **Loop Handling**: The program processes each test case independently, ensuring that the output for one test case does not affect another.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
