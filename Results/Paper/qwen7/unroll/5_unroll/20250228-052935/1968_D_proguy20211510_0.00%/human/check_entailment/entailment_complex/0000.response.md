Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the input for each test case and initializes necessary variables.
2. It handles the special case where both players start at the position with the maximum value in the array `a`, leading to a draw.
3. The logic for determining the winner is based on simulating the game for `k` turns and calculating the scores for both players.
4. The function uses lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha respectively, considering their movements and the values at those positions.
5. It calculates the prefix sums of these scores and then computes the final scores for both players after `k` turns.
6. Finally, it compares the final scores and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Given the above analysis, the provided code seems to follow the logic described in the problem statement and correctly implements the solution.

Correctness: **True**
