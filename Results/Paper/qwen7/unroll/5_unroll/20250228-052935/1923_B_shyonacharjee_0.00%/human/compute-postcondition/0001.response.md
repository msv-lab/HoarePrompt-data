State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 0**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is used as a placeholder in the `for` loop, and it starts from 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration. Since the loop is iterating `t` times, the initial value of `_` should be 0.
- The variable `t` represents the number of test cases, and it needs to be within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4) for the loop to execute properly. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `x`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
