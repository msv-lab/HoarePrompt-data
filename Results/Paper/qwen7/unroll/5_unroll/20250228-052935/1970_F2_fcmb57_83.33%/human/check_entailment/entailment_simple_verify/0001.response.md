### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program correctly initializes the field dimensions, players, goals, and the initial position of the Quaffle.
   - It sets up dictionaries and lists to track player movements and game state.

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input to identify players, goals, and the initial position of the Quaffle.
   - It also correctly identifies the middle of the field.

3. **Movement Function**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly updates the position of a player based on the direction of movement.
   - This function is used correctly within the main loop.

4. **Game Logic**:
   - **Player Movements**:
     - The program correctly handles player movements, ensuring that players do not move out of bounds.
     - Players cannot catch a ball unless they are in the same cell as the ball.
   - **Ball Handling**:
     - The program correctly handles catching and throwing the Quaffle.
     - When a player catches the Quaffle, it updates the Quaffle's position to the player's current position.
     - When a player throws the Quaffle, it updates the Quaffle's position to an empty string, indicating that the Quaffle is no longer being carried.
   - **Scoring**:
     - The program correctly identifies when a player scores a goal and prints the appropriate message.
     - It also correctly updates the score and moves the Quaffle to the middle of the field when a goal is scored.
   - **Elimination**:
     - The program correctly identifies when a player is eliminated due to a Bludger and prints the appropriate message.
     - It also correctly handles the elimination of multiple players at the same time.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the final score at the end of the game.

However, there is a critical issue with the `func_1` function. The function is defined to take a 2D coordinate `(x, y)` and a direction `(dx, dy)`, but it returns a tuple of the form `(x + dx, y + dy)`. However, the function is called with `players[mo[0]]` and `mouvements[mo[1]]`, which are both 2D coordinates. The function should be defined to accept and return tuples of the form `(x, y)`.

Here is the corrected `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

With this correction, the program should work as intended.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate, but there was a minor issue in the `func_1` function definition that needed to be corrected. With the correction, the program should handle all aspects of the problem correctly.
