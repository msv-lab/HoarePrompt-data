Output State: **The program returns x + b, y + b**

Given the initial state:
- `x` is the first element of the first sublist in `a`
- `y` is the second element of the first sublist in `a`
- `dx` is equal to `b`
- `dy` is equal to `b`

The code `return x + dx, y + dy` calculates the new coordinates by adding `b` (which is equal to both `dx` and `dy`) to `x` and `y` respectively. Therefore, the program returns the new coordinates as `x + b, y + b`.
