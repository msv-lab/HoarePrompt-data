Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list `a` representing a field and an integer `b` representing the number of steps. It returns the coordinates (x, y) shifted by `b` in both dimensions.**

This means the function takes a 2D list `a` where each element is a string indicating different elements on the field, and an integer `b` representing movement steps. The function then returns new coordinates (x + b, y + b) after shifting by `b` steps in both the x and y directions.
