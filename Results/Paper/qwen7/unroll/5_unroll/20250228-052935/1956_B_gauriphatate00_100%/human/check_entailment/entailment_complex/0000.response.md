Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly simulate the game rules as described. Specifically, the function `func_1` only calculates the number of integers in the list `a` that appear exactly twice. However, the game rules state that Nene will play optimally to maximize her score while minimizing your score. This means that Nene will try to prevent you from scoring points by ensuring that you do not place cards on the table when there is already a matching card present.

The function `func_1` does not account for Nene's optimal strategy. Instead, it simply counts how many pairs of cards you have, which does not reflect the dynamic nature of the game where Nene will strategically place her cards to minimize your score.

Given the problem description, the correct approach would involve simulating the game turns and considering Nene's optimal moves. The current implementation does not simulate the game or consider Nene's strategic placement of cards.

Correctness: **False**
