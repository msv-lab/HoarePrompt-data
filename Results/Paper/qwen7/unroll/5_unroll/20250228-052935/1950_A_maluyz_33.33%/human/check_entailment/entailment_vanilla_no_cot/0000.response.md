Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a logical error in its conditions for determining whether the digits form a peak. Specifically, the condition `elif a == b == c:` will catch cases where all three digits are equal, but it does not correctly handle other cases that should be classified as a peak.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

func()
```

In the corrected version, the condition `elif a < b > c:` correctly identifies cases where the middle digit is greater than the other two, thus forming a peak.
