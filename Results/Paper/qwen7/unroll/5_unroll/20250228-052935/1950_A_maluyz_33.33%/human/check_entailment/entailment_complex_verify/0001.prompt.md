You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of strings printed during each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided. For each iteration, if `a < b < c`, it prints 'STAIR'; if `a == b == c`, it prints 'NONE'; if `max(a, b, c) == b`, it prints 'PEAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. The exact sequence of these strings depends on the input values provided for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\)), and prints one of four possible outcomes: 'STAIR', 'PEAK', 'NONE', or 'NONE' again depending on the relationship between \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). It accepts no parameters and does not return any value; instead, it outputs strings based on the conditions met by the input values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   
2. **Conditions Check**:
   - **Stair Condition**: The program checks if `a < b < c`. If this condition is met, it prints 'STAIR'.
   - **Peak Condition**: The program checks if `a < b > c`. This is done using the condition `max(a, b, c) == b`. However, this condition alone is not sufficient because it does not account for the possibility that `a` could be equal to `b` or `c` while still forming a peak.
   - **Equal Digits**: The program correctly handles the case where all three digits are equal (`a == b == c`) and prints 'NONE'.
   - **Other Cases**: For any other combination, the program prints 'NONE'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program fails to handle the case where `a > b < c` which should also be considered a peak.
   - The current implementation incorrectly classifies `a > b < c` as 'NONE' instead of 'PEAK'.

### Correctness:

Given the analysis above, the program does not fully cover all conditions for a peak. Specifically, it misses the case where `a > b < c`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, you need to adjust the peak condition check to properly handle the case where `a > b < c`. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif a > b < c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This will ensure that all conditions for a peak are correctly identified.
