Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used to determine the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Input Variable**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means the input value for the `range` function will be within this range.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop will execute based on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the input value (which will be used in the `range` function) is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Given these steps, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.

This ensures that the loop will execute the correct number of times based on the input value.
