Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the sequence), and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it calculates a list `a` where `a[0] = 500` and `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` for `1 â‰¤ i < n`. Finally, it prints the list `a` for each test case.**
