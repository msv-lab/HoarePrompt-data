Reasoning:

The provided code correctly identifies the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates among the four given points. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined solely from the x-coordinates (or y-coordinates), and squaring this difference gives the area of the square.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates.
3. It extracts the x-coordinates into a list `x`.
4. It calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`).
5. It prints the area of the square, which is `dx * dx`.

Given the problem constraints and the guarantee that the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, this approach will always yield the correct area for each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
