Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and processes t test cases, where each test case consists of four lines of input containing two integers x_i, y_i such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. The function verifies if these coordinates form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, and returns information about the test cases.**

This means the function does not take any direct parameters but handles multiple test cases, each defined by four lines of input representing the coordinates of the corners of a potential square. The function checks if these coordinates form a valid square with sides parallel to the axes and a positive area, and then provides the result for each test case.
