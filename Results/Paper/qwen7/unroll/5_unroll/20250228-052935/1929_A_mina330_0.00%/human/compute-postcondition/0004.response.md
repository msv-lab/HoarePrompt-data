Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of data. Each set includes an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns different outputs based on the input for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t`, indicating the number of subsequent data sets to process. Each data set includes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function processes each data set according to the given constraints and returns appropriate results for each test case.
