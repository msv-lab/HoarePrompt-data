Reasoning: 
The given program aims to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and then pairing the largest element with the smallest, the second largest with the second smallest, and so on. This approach ensures that the differences between these pairs are maximized, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n.

Let's break down the steps:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`ntest`).
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself.
3. It sorts the array, which is crucial for ensuring that the largest and smallest elements are paired optimally.
4. It then iterates through half of the sorted array (since we are pairing elements symmetrically), calculating the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest, second largest and second smallest, etc.
5. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program logic is sound and should produce the correct results for the given examples and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
