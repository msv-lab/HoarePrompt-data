Functionality: The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and forms a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. It calculates the balance of parentheses up to each position in `s`, sorts these positions based on their balance values, and then constructs a new string containing characters from `s` at the sorted positions. The function returns this new string.
