Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and for each test case, a binary string `s` is provided where 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and `s_i` ∈ {0, 1}.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. For each test case, a binary string `s` is expected to be provided, but since the code does not include the part where `s` is read, the state of `s` remains unchanged. The precondition that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases is maintained, and for each test case, a binary string `s` is expected to follow.
