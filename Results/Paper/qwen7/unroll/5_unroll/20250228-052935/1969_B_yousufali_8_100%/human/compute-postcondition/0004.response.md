Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls another function `func_1()` to process a binary string `s` of length between 2 and 200,000 characters containing only '0's and '1's. After processing all test cases, it does not modify the values of `t` or `s`.**
