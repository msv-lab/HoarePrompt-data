Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` represents the number of previous indices with the same character as the `i`-th index in the string. The function returns a string `s` that contains characters from 'a' to 'z' based on the values in the list `char_count`, where each integer in `char_count` represents the number of times its corresponding character appears in `s`.**
