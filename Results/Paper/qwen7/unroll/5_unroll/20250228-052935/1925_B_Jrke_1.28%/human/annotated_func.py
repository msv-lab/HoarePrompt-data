#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x.

    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, with the additional condition that the output of the loop is the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to x//n, or 1 if no such divisor exists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it reads two integers \(x\) and \(n\). It then finds the maximum divisor of \(x\) that is less than or equal to \(x // n\), or prints 1 if no such divisor exists. The function outputs this value for each test case.
