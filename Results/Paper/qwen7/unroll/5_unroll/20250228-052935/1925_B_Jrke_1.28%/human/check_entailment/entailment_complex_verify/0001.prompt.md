You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x.

    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, with the additional condition that the output of the loop is the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to x//n, or 1 if no such divisor exists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it reads two integers \(x\) and \(n\). It then finds the maximum divisor of \(x\) that is less than or equal to \(x // n\), or prints 1 if no such divisor exists. The function outputs this value for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which denotes the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - It calculates `k = x // n`, which gives the minimum possible difficulty per sub-problem if they were evenly distributed.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `k == 1`, it prints `1` immediately. This is because if the smallest possible difficulty is `1`, the GCD of any set of `n` ones is `1`.

4. **Finding Maximum Balance**:
   - The program then iterates over odd numbers from `1` to `sqrt(x)` (inclusive).
   - For each odd number `i`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i`.
   - If `x` is divisible by `i`, it considers both `i` and `x // i` as potential difficulties.
   - It keeps track of the maximum GCD value found among these possibilities.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the maximum GCD value found.

### Reasoning:

- **Divisibility Check**: The program correctly identifies potential divisors of `x` by iterating over odd numbers up to `sqrt(x)`. This is efficient and ensures that all factors are considered.
- **GCD Calculation**: The logic to find the maximum GCD among the divisors and their corresponding quotients is sound. The program ensures that the difficulties are positive integers and their sum equals `x`.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where `k == 1` correctly by printing `1`.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program appears to be correct. It efficiently finds the maximum balance (GCD) of the difficulties for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
