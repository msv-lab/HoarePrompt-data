Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, with the additional condition that the output of the loop is the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to x//n, or 1 if no such divisor exists.
