Precondition: **main_ar is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (a_i, b_i); sec_arr is a list of integers.** 

However, based on the problem description and the context, the function `func_3` does not seem to directly contribute to solving the described game problem. Instead, it appears to be calculating a sum based on some conditions involving elements from `main_ar` and `sec_arr`. Given the problem context, the function might be intended to process the input data or prepare it for further calculations related to the game logic, but its current implementation does not align with the expected behavior for the described scenario.

To properly address the problem, we would need a function that processes the input data according to the rules of the game and calculates Alice's optimal profit. The provided function `func_3` does not seem to do that.
