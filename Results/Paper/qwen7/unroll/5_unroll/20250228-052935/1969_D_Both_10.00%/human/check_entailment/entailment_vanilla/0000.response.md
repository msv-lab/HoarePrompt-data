Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function Definitions:**
   - `func_1()`: This function returns an integer value read from standard input.
   - `func_2()`: This function returns a tuple of integers read from standard input.
   - `func_3(main_ar, sec_arr)`: This function calculates a sum based on the elements of `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.

2. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem involves optimizing Alice's profit given constraints on the number of items she buys and the actions of Bob.
   - Alice wants to maximize her profit, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The profit calculation involves comparing prices `a_i` and `b_i` for Alice and Bob respectively.

3. **Key Points in the Solution:**
   - The solution needs to handle multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it should read the number of items `n` and the threshold `k`.
   - It should also read the arrays `a` and `b` representing the prices for Alice and Bob.
   - The optimal strategy involves sorting the items based on the difference `b_i - a_i` and selecting items accordingly to maximize Alice's profit.

4. **Code Review:**
   - The provided code does not implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Specifically, it does not sort the items based on the difference `b_i - a_i` and does not handle the selection of items to maximize Alice's profit.
   - The `func_3` function does not correctly implement the logic required for the problem. It simply sums up certain values without considering the constraints and optimal selection criteria.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
