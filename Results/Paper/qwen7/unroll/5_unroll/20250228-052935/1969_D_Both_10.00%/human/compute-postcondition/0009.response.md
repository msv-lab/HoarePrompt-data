Functionality: The function accepts two parameters: `main_ar`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, and `sec_arr`, a list of integers. It calculates and returns the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the first and second elements of each tuple is greater than or equal to 0.
