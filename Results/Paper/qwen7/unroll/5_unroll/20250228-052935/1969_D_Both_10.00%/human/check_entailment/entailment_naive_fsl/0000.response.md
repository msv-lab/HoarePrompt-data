Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not address the core logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Function Definitions**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are defined but their implementations do not align with the problem requirements. `func_1` and `func_2` are placeholders and do not provide the necessary logic to solve the problem. `func_3` attempts to sum values but does not handle the logic of selecting items for Alice and Bob to maximize/minimize Alice's profit.

2. **Missing Core Logic**: The program lacks the logic to:
   - Determine the optimal subset of items for Alice to buy.
   - Calculate the profit considering the conditions for Bob taking items for free.
   - Handle the different scenarios based on whether Alice buys fewer than \(k\) items or more than or equal to \(k\) items.

3. **No Input/Output Handling**: The functions do not process the input data or output the result as specified in the problem statement.

Given these issues, the program cannot be considered correct as it fails to implement the required logic and does not handle the input/output as described in the problem statement.
