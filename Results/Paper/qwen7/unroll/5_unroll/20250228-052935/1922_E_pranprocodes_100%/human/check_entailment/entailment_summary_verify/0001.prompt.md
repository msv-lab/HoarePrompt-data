You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        max = 100000000
        min = -100000000
        ans = []
        t = 0
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        ans.reverse()
        print(t)
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it takes an integer \(x\) and determines the number of steps required to reduce \(x\) to 1 by either halving \(x\) when it is even or decrementing \(x\) by 1 when it is odd. It also generates a list of integers representing the maximum value (starting from 100000000) for each even step and the minimum value (starting from -100000000) for each odd step, with the list reversed at the end. The function outputs the number of steps and the generated list for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The provided solution attempts to construct such an array using a binary-like approach where each bit position corresponds to an element in the array.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The algorithm initializes `max` and `min` values to represent the upper and lower bounds of the array elements.
   - It uses a while loop to reduce `x` to 1, appending either `max` or `min` to the `ans` list based on whether `x` is even or odd.
   - If `x` is even, it appends `max` and decrements `max`. If `x` is odd, it appends `min` and increments `min`.
   - After reducing `x` to 1, the `ans` list is reversed and printed along with its length.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `X = 2`, the output should be `[0]` because the array `[0]` has exactly one increasing subsequence (itself).
   - For other values of `X`, the algorithm constructs an array where each bit position represents an element, ensuring the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly handles the construction of the array for various values of `X` within the specified constraints.
   - The approach ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X` by leveraging the binary representation of `X`.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is correct, printing the length of the array followed by the array elements.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
