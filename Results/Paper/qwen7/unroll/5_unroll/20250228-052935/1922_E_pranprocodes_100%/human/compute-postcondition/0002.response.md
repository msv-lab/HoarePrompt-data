Output State: t is the number of steps required to reduce x to 1 by either dividing by 2 when x is even or decrementing by 1 when x is odd. ans is a list containing integers that represent the maximum value (starting from 100000000) decremented by 1 for each even step and the minimum value (starting from -100000000) incremented by 1 for each odd step, with the list reversed at the end.
