### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The provided solution attempts to construct such an array using a binary-like approach where each bit position corresponds to an element in the array.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The algorithm initializes `max` and `min` values to represent the upper and lower bounds of the array elements.
   - It uses a while loop to reduce `x` to 1, appending either `max` or `min` to the `ans` list based on whether `x` is even or odd.
   - If `x` is even, it appends `max` and decrements `max`. If `x` is odd, it appends `min` and increments `min`.
   - After reducing `x` to 1, the `ans` list is reversed and printed along with its length.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `X = 2`, the output should be `[0]` because the array `[0]` has exactly one increasing subsequence (itself). However, the program outputs `1 0` instead of just `0`.
   - For other values of `X`, the algorithm constructs an array where each bit position represents an element, ensuring the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly handles the construction of the array for various values of `X` within the specified constraints.
   - The approach ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X` by leveraging the binary representation of `X`.
   - However, the program does not handle the special case where `X = 2` correctly. The output should be a single element array `[0]` instead of `[1, 0]`.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is correct, printing the length of the array followed by the array elements.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences, except for the special case where `X = 2`. The program outputs `[1, 0]` instead of `[0]` for `X = 2`, which is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
