Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly generate an array with the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by \(X\). The logic in the current implementation does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences. Instead, it attempts to construct an array using a binary-like approach, which does not align with the requirement to have exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences.

To solve this problem correctly, one would need to use a more sophisticated approach, possibly involving factorization of \(X\) and constructing the array based on the factors. Hereâ€™s a brief outline of how a correct solution might work:

1. **Factorize \(X\)**: Determine the prime factorization of \(X\).
2. **Construct the Array**: Use the factors to construct an array where the number of increasing subsequences matches \(X\).

Here is a conceptual outline of a correct solution:

```python
from math import isqrt

def count_increasing_subsequences(n):
    # This function returns the number of increasing subsequences in an array of length n
    return 2**n - 1

def find_array_with_X_increasing_subsequences(X):
    # Factorize X to find the required structure
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, isqrt(X) + 1):
        while X % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            X //= i
    if X > 1:
        factors.append(X)
    
    # Construct the array based on the factors
    n = len(factors)
    arr = [0] * n
    for i, f in enumerate(factors):
        arr[i] = f - 1
    
    return arr

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        X = int(input())
        arr = find_array_with_X_increasing_subsequences(X)
        if arr:
            print(len(arr))
            print(' '.join(map(str, arr)))
        else:
            print(-1)

func()
```

This solution uses the properties of powers of 2 to construct arrays with the desired number of increasing subsequences. However, the actual implementation would need to handle edge cases and ensure correctness for all possible values of \(X\).
