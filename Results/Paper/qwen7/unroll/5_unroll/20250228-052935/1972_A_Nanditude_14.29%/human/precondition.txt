arr is a list of two lists, where the first list contains n non-negative integers representing the difficulties of the initial problems (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), and the second list contains n non-negative integers representing the expected maximum difficulties (b_1, b_2, ..., b_n). Both lists are sorted in non-decreasing order.
