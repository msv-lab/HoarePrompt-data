Reasoning:
The provided program aims to find the minimum number of new problems needed to ensure that each problem's actual difficulty \(a_i\) does not exceed the expected difficulty \(b_i\). The program iterates through both arrays `a` and `b` simultaneously, and whenever an element in `b` is less than the corresponding element in `a`, it proposes a new problem with the difficulty equal to the current element in `b`, sorts the updated array `a` in non-decreasing order, and removes the last element. This process continues until all elements in `a` are less than or equal to the corresponding elements in `b`.

The function `func_1` mentioned in the execution summary is not used in the main program logic and seems irrelevant to the problem. It simply sorts a list in descending order, which is not required for solving the given problem.

Given the logic in the program, it correctly implements the steps described in the problem statement. It ensures that the difficulties are adjusted to meet the constraints by proposing new problems when necessary and maintaining the non-decreasing order of the array `a`.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
