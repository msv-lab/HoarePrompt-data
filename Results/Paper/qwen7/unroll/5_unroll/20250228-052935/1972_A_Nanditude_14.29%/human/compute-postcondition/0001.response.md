Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of two lists. The first list contains `n` non-decreasing integers representing the difficulties of the initial problems, and the second list contains `n` non-decreasing integers representing the expected maximum difficulties. The function returns a list of two lists, where both lists are sorted in descending order.**
