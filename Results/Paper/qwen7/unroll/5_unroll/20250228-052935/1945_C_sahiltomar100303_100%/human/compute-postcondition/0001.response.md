State: **`t` must be greater than 0, and `t` must be less than or equal to 2⋅10^4**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` iterates `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer.
3. Given the constraint `1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4`, `t` must be within this range.
4. The other variables (`n` and `a`) are not mentioned in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.
