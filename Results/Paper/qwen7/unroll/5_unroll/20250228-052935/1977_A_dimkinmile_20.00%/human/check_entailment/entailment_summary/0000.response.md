Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by reading multiple test cases and processing each one individually. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. The variable `kreker` is used to read the number of test cases, which is correct.
2. A loop runs `kreker` times to process each test case.
3. Inside this loop, the function `func_1()` is called, but `func_1()` does not take any arguments. This means that when `func_1()` is called inside the loop, it will not receive the necessary inputs `n` and `m`.

To fix this, the function `func_1()` should be modified to accept the inputs `n` and `m` directly. Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, m):
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    func_1(n, m)
```

With these changes, the function `func_1()` will correctly receive the inputs `n` and `m` for each test case, and the program will work as intended.

Correctness: **False**
