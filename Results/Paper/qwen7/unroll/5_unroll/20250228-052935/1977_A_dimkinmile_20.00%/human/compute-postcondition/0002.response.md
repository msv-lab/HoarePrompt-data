Output: **Yes**

Explanation: Based on the initial state provided, `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. The print statement simply outputs the string 'Yes', and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `m`. Therefore, the output is simply 'Yes'.
