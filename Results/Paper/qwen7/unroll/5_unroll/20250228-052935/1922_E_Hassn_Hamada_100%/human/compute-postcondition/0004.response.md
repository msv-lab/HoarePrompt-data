Output State: **`size_overlap` is (0, 0)**

Explanation: The code initializes `size_overlap` to a tuple `(0, 0)`. This means both elements of the tuple are set to 0. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the only change is to the `size_overlap` variable, which is now a tuple with both elements set to 0.
