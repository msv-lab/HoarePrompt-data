Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to generate an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to generate a sequence that results in a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - The logic inside `func_1` involves bitwise operations and recursive calls to build the sequence.
   - The base case is when `number` is 0, which returns `(0, 0)`.
   - For non-zero `number`, it calculates a `size_overlap` which helps in determining how many elements to add to the sequence.
   - It appends values to the sequence based on the calculated `size_overlap` and recursively calls itself with a modified `number`.

3. **Recursive Construction**:
   - The function constructs the sequence by appending values in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences matches the target `X`.
   - The sequence construction is based on binary representation and bitwise operations, ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences is correctly managed.

4. **Output Generation**:
   - After constructing the sequence, the program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.
   - This matches the requirements of the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `number` is 0 by returning `(0, 0)`, which correctly indicates the end of recursion.
   - For larger values of `X`, the function constructs the sequence correctly using bitwise operations and recursion.

Given the detailed analysis, the function `func_1` correctly generates the sequence based on the input `X`, and the main program correctly prints the sequence and its length.

Correctness: **True**
