You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `number` (where \(2 \leq number \leq 10^{18}\)) and a list of integers `sequence`. It generates a sequence based on `number` and modifies `sequence` accordingly. If `number` is 0, the function returns two zeros. Otherwise, it calculates a `size_overlap` pair and uses it to append values to `sequence`. Finally, it recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and the updated `sequence`. The function ultimately returns two zeros.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`test_cases`).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the desired number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input number.
   - It uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.
   - The function maintains a tuple `(size, overlap)` which helps in determining the next element to add to the sequence.

3. **Recursive Logic**:
   - The function iterates backward from the maximum possible value to 0.
   - It calculates the size and value based on powers of 2.
   - It checks if the current value can be used to form the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - If the value is less than or equal to the remaining number, it updates the `(size, overlap)` tuple and breaks out of the loop.
   - It then appends the calculated values to the sequence and recursively calls itself with the updated number.

4. **Output Generation**:
   - After generating the sequence, the program prints the length of the sequence.
   - It then prints the sequence itself.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

1. **Correctness of Sequence Generation**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to generate a sequence that results in exactly `n` increasing subsequences.
   - The logic seems to correctly handle the generation of sequences using powers of 2, which is a known method to achieve specific counts of increasing subsequences.
   - However, the implementation details need to be verified for edge cases and correctness.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 0 by returning an empty sequence, which is correct.
   - It also handles the case where `n` is 1 by returning a sequence of length 1, which is correct.
   - For larger values of `n`, the recursive function should correctly generate the sequence.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself, which matches the problem requirements.

### Testing and Validation:

To validate the correctness, we can test the program with various inputs, including edge cases like `n = 2, 5, 13, 37`, and verify if the generated sequences have the correct number of increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program appears to follow the correct logic to generate sequences with the desired number of increasing subsequences. The recursive approach and the use of powers of 2 seem appropriate for this problem.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
