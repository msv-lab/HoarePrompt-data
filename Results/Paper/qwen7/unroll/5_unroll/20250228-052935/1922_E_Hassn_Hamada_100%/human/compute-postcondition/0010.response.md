Output State: **size_overlap is (1, 0), sequence is (1, 2, 3, ..., size-1)**.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - overlap - 1`. For each iteration, `i + overlap` is appended to the `sequence` list. Given the initial `size_overlap` is `(1, 0)`, and assuming `size` and `overlap` are the first and second elements of `size_overlap` respectively, the loop will append values starting from `overlap` up to `size-1`. Thus, if `size` is `n`, the `sequence` will contain numbers from `1` to `n-1`.
