### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order and does not account for the possibility of sorting the array by splitting and swapping parts. As a result, `func_1` is insufficient for solving the problem.

However, the original assessment concludes that the entire program is incorrect because `func_1` is not sufficient. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the annotated code and the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.
   - This function does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by splitting and swapping parts, but it is still a part of the logic that needs to be corrected.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases (`t`), the size of each array (`n`), and the elements of each array.
   - It then calls `func_1` with each array and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results.

Given the problem description, the function `func_1` should check if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping parts. The original assessment missed the fact that `func_1` is just a part of the solution and needs to be corrected.

### Corrected Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to modify `func_1` to check if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping parts. Here's a revised approach:

1. **Check if the array is already sorted**.
2. **If not, check if the array can be split and swapped to become sorted**.

Here is a possible implementation:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    # Check if the array is already sorted
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)):
        return 'Yes'
    
    # Check if the array can be split and swapped to become sorted
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            if arr[:i] + arr[i:j][::-1] + arr[j:] == sorted(arr):
                return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()
```

With this corrected approach, `func_1` now correctly checks if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping parts. The original assessment missed this detail, leading to an incorrect conclusion.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

The original assessment was inaccurate because it did not fully consider the need to modify `func_1` to check if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping parts.

Final: **False**
