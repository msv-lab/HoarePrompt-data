Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is an integer from the data list at position `index`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ 10^6 for all i, and `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces.**

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value from the `data` list at the current `index` to the variable `t`. After this assignment, `index` is incremented by 1 to point to the next element in the `data` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
