Output State: `index` is 2 + 2 * t, `t` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ 10^6 for all i, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `results` is a list of length t where each element is the result of calling `func_1` on a list of n integers.
