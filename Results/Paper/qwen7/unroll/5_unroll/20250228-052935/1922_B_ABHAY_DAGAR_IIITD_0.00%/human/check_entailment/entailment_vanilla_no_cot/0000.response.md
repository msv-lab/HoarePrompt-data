Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to solve the problem but contains several logical errors and does not correctly implement the solution for forming a non-degenerate triangle. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Triangle Inequality Check**: The program does not check if the three chosen sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. For three sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(a \leq b \leq c\)), the triangle inequality conditions are \(a + b > c\). The current implementation does not include this check.

2. **Overcounting**: The program calculates combinations without ensuring that the chosen sticks can actually form a triangle. It simply counts the number of ways to choose 3 sticks regardless of whether they satisfy the triangle inequality conditions.

3. **Redundant Calculations**: The program uses a dictionary to count occurrences of each stick length and then incorrectly applies combinatorial formulas to count the number of ways to form triangles, which does not account for the triangle inequality.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
- Ensure that the three chosen sticks satisfy the triangle inequality.
- Use combinatorial methods to count valid triplets efficiently.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
func_1(t)

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n = int(input())
        num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Count occurrences of each stick length
        num_of_lens = {}
        for x in num_list:
            if x in num_of_lens:
                num_of_lens[x] += 1
            else:
                num_of_lens[x] = 1
        
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                for k in range(j+1, n):
                    if (num_list[i] + num_list[j] > num_list[k]) and \
                       (num_list[i] + num_list[k] > num_list[j]) and \
                       (num_list[j] + num_list[k] > num_list[i]):
                        res += 1
        
        results.append(res)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This corrected version directly checks the triangle inequality conditions and counts the valid triplets, ensuring the solution is correct.
