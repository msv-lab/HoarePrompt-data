Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `a_i`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - It uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count how many times each stick length appears.
   - This part is correct and necessary to determine the number of sticks of each length.

3. **Calculating Number of Ways to Form a Triangle:**
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle.
   - The logic here is flawed:
     - To form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.
     - The current implementation does not check this condition.
     - Instead, it seems to be counting combinations of sticks without considering the triangle inequality theorem.

4. **Combination Calculations:**
   - The program calculates combinations using:
     - `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` which is the combination formula for choosing 3 items from `cnt` items.
     - `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` which is also a combination formula but seems to be used incorrectly.
   - These calculations do not account for the triangle inequality theorem.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the examples provided:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `7 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Expected Output: `35`
  - The program will count all combinations of 3 sticks, which is `7 choose 3 = 35`. However, since all sticks have the same length, no triangle can be formed (as per the triangle inequality theorem).

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `4 3 2 1 3`
  - Expected Output: `2`
  - The program will count the combinations of sticks, but again, it does not check the triangle inequality. The correct answer should be 2 (choosing the 1st, 2nd, and 4th stick or the 1st, 3rd, and 4th stick).

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the logic to check the triangle inequality theorem. Therefore, it will produce incorrect results for most test cases.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
