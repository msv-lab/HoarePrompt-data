State: **`pos` is -1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is a list generated by the function `func_2()`, `i` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `i` is defined in the loop head as `for i in range(n)`.
2. The range function starts from 0 and goes up to (but does not include) `n`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must start at 0.
4. The values of `pos`, `n`, `k`, and `arr` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute; they are initialized before the loop starts.
5. Therefore, the only state that needs to be explicitly adjusted for the loop to execute is setting `i` to 0.

Thus, the state after adjusting for the loop to execute is: **`pos` is -1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is a list generated by the function `func_2()`, `i` is 0**.
