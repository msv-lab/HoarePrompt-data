Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Card Counting Logic**:
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n` because fewer than `k` cards cannot be exchanged, and thus the number of cards remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to get the frequency table of card numbers, ensuring no number appears more than `k` times.
   - If `k` is found in the values of the frequency table, it prints `k - 1` as the result.
   - Otherwise, it prints `n` (the total number of cards).
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly creates a frequency table where each key is a unique number from the list `arr` and its value is the maximum occurrence of that number up to `k`.
   - If any number appears more than `k` times, its count in the frequency table is capped at `k`.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `k > n`, the logic is correct as no exchanges can happen, so the number of cards remains `n`.
   - For cases where `k` is in the frequency table, the logic is correct as it ensures the minimum number of cards is printed.
   - For cases where `k` is not in the frequency table, the logic is also correct as it prints the total number of cards.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the specified operations.

Correctness: **True**
