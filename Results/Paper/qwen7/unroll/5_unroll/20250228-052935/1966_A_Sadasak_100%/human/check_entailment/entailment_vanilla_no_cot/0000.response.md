Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function `func_1` Purpose**: The function `func_1` is intended to limit the frequency of each number in the array to `k`, but its purpose is not clear in the context of solving the problem. It doesn't help in determining the minimum number of cards remaining.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards Calculation**:
   - The program checks if `k > n`. If true, it prints `n`, which is incorrect because even if `k > n`, the minimum number of cards can still be less than `n`.
   - The logic for checking if `k` is in the frequency values and then printing `k - 1` is flawed. This approach does not guarantee the minimum number of cards remaining.
   
3. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each unique number, calculate how many full sets of `k` cards can be formed.
   - The remainder of the division of the count of each number by `k` will give the minimum number of cards that cannot be part of a full set of `k` cards.
   - Sum up these remainders for all unique numbers, and add 1 if there are any full sets of `k` cards that can be formed.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Count the frequency of each card
    freq = Counter(nums)
    
    min_cards = 0
    full_sets = 0
    
    for count in freq.values():
        quotient, remainder = divmod(count, k)
        min_cards += remainder
        full_sets += quotient
    
    # If there are any full sets, we can reduce the total by (full_sets - 1)
    if full_sets > 0:
        min_cards += 1
    
    print(min_cards)
```

This corrected program should accurately compute the minimum number of cards remaining after performing the allowed operations.
