Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` from input, which is stored in the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds its initial state, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3. The value of `n` is set to the integer input received, and it must satisfy the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.
