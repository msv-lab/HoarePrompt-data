Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, each iteration of the loop processes a list `arr` and prints either 'NO' or 'YES' based on whether the list satisfies a specific condition, and the final output is the result of the last iteration of the loop.
