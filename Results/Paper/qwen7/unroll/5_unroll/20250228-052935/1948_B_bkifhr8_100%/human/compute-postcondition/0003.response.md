Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and for each iteration of the loop, `m` is an integer input, `arr` is a list of integers input as a space-separated string, and `ans` is a boolean value determined based on the conditions inside the loop. After all iterations, the output will be a list of "NO" or "YES" strings corresponding to the boolean values of `ans` for each iteration.
