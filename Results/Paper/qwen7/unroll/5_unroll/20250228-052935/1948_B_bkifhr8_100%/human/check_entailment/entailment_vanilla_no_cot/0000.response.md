Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Sorted Order**: The program checks if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and then tries to sort the elements by splitting the larger number into its digits and comparing. However, the logic for checking if it's possible to make the array sorted is flawed. It doesn't properly handle the transformation of numbers and the possibility of making the array sorted through multiple operations.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Digits Splitting**: The program attempts to split the number and check if the resulting list of digits is sorted. This approach is not sufficient because it only checks one potential transformation and doesn't account for the fact that multiple transformations might be needed to sort the array.

3. **No Proper Transformation Logic**: The program does not correctly simulate the process of repeatedly splitting and inserting digits until the array is sorted or determines that it's impossible to do so.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the process of repeatedly splitting and inserting digits until the array is sorted or determine that it's impossible to do so. Hereâ€™s a more appropriate solution:

```python
def can_sort_array(arr):
    while True:
        sorted_arr = sorted(arr)
        if arr == sorted_arr:
            return True
        changed = False
        for i in range(len(arr) - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                num_str = str(arr[i - 1])
                new_digits = [int(digit) for digit in num_str]
                if new_digits != sorted(new_digits):
                    return False
                arr[i - 1] = new_digits[0]
                changed = True
        if not changed:
            return False
        arr = [num for sublist in arr for num in sublist]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if can_sort_array(arr):
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

This solution correctly simulates the process of repeatedly splitting and inserting digits until the array is sorted or determines that it's impossible to do so.
