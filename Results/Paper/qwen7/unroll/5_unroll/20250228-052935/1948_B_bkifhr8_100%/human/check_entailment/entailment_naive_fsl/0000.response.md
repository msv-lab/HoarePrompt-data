Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program checks if the digits of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]` combined form a sorted sequence. However, it does not ensure that after splitting and reinserting the digits, the resulting array remains valid according to the problem's rules.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
12 3 45 67
```
The program would check the pairs (45, 67), (12, 45), and (3, 12). It correctly identifies that (45, 67) is already sorted. However, it incorrectly assumes that the operations on (12, 45) and (3, 12) will always result in a sorted array, without considering the full transformation process.

A correct approach would involve recursively applying the digit-splitting operation and checking if the resulting array is sorted. The provided solution does not account for all possible transformations and thus may fail in certain scenarios.
