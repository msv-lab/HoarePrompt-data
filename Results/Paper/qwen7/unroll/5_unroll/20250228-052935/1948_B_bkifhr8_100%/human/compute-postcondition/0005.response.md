Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of an integer \( n \) followed by \( n \) integers. It checks whether the sequence of integers can be made non-decreasing by swapping adjacent elements at most once. If such a sequence can be formed, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function reads input from standard input and prints output to standard output, handling up to 1000 test cases.**
