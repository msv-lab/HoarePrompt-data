Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses based on the conditions evaluated for each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, the value of `n` (read from input) and the string `a` (read from input) will be used to determine if the count of '1's in `a` meets certain criteria. If the count is 0, 2 or more even, or exactly 2 with specific spacing, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The final output state will be a sequence of these 'YES' and 'NO' responses corresponding to each iteration of the loop.
