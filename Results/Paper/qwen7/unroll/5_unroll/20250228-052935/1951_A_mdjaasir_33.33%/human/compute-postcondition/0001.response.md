State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer, `i` must be 0, `t` must be at least 1**.

### Explanation:
- The loop `for i in range(t):` will execute if `t` is at least 1. This is because the `range(t)` function generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`.
- Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0, as the loop starts with `i = 0`.
- The variable `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 0 and `t` to be at least 1.
