Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are both digits and letters in the password, and the digits are not sorted in non-decreasing order. For example, consider the password `123abc`. According to the problem description, this password should be considered invalid because the digits `1`, `2`, and `3` are not sorted in non-decreasing order. However, the current implementation does not check the order of digits properly. It only checks if the digits are sorted separately from the letters and does not ensure that the digits themselves are in the correct order relative to each other. This oversight means the program will incorrectly return "YES" for such cases.
