Reasoning:
1. The provided program reads multiple test cases from standard input and processes each one.
2. For each test case, it correctly extracts the password and passes it to the `func_1` function.
3. The `func_1` function:
   - Separates digits and letters into two lists.
   - Checks if the digits list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - Checks if the letters list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - Ensures that the last digit in the password does not come after any letter.
4. The logic implemented in `func_1` matches the problem statement requirements:
   - All digits must be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - All letters must be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
5. The program correctly prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions checked.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
