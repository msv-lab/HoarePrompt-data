Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `char`, which is used to iterate over each character in the string `password`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `char`**: Since the loop starts iterating over each character in `password`, the initial value of `char` will be the first character of the string `password`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `password`**: The string `password` consists of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

4. **Initial state of `digits` and `letters`**: Both `digits` and `letters` are initially empty lists. These lists will be populated during the loop execution, but their initial state does not affect the loop's ability to start executing.

5. **Conditions for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as there are characters left to iterate over in `password`. Therefore, the condition for the loop to start executing is that `password` must contain at least one character.

Given these points, we can summarize the required adjustments:

- The variable `char` should be set to the first character of `password`.
- The string `password` must contain at least one character.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`password` is a non-empty string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, `char` is the first character of `password`, `digits` is an empty list, `letters` is an empty list**.
