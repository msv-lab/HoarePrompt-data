You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: Output State: The output consists of multiple lines, each corresponding to a test case. For each test case, it prints pairs of numbers from the list `a` based on the following rules:
    #
    #1. It first prints pairs of numbers from the first half of the list `a` (indices 0 to n-1) where each number appears exactly twice. It stops once it has printed `k` such pairs or when there are no more such pairs left.
    #2. If there are still required pairs (`k` is not zero), it then prints single occurrences from the first half of the list `a` until it has printed the remaining required pairs.
    #3. After that, it prints the collected single occurrences from step 2.
    #4. Finally, it prints pairs of numbers from the second half of the list `a` (indices n to 2n-1) where each number appears exactly twice, stopping when it matches the count of pairs printed in the first step.
    #
    #Each line ends with a space-separated list of the single occurrences printed during the process, followed by a newline.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, along with two integers n and k. It prints pairs of numbers from the first half of the list and single occurrences from the first half based on the value of k. After that, it prints the collected single occurrences and finally pairs from the second half of the list, ensuring the total number of printed pairs and single occurrences matches the specified k. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Arrays `l` and `r` are initialized to store the selected elements.
   - Variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are used to track the count of elements added to `l` and `r`.
   - An empty list `res` is used to store elements that are added to `r`.

3. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program counts how many times each element appears in the first half of the array (`l`).
   - It counts how many times each element appears in the second half of the array (`r`).

4. **Selecting Elements for `l`:**
   - The program tries to select pairs of elements from the first half of the array where the element appears exactly twice.
   - If it finds `k` such pairs, it prints them and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Selecting Remaining Elements for `l`:**
   - If fewer than `k` pairs were found, the program selects remaining elements from the first half of the array where the element appears once.
   - These elements are stored in `res`.

6. **Selecting Elements for `r`:**
   - The program prints the elements stored in `res` as the second half of `l`.
   - It then tries to find pairs of elements from the second half of the array where the element appears exactly twice to match the XOR value of `l`.

7. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - If the XOR values of `l` and `r` do not match, the program tries to adjust by selecting more elements from the second half of the array.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Initialization and Counting:**
   - The arrays `l` and `r` are initialized to size `n`, but they should be of size `2k` to store the required number of elements.
   - The counting logic for `l` and `r` is incorrect. The program should directly use the counts to select elements without modifying the original arrays.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Selecting Elements:**
   - The logic for selecting elements for `l` and `r` is flawed. It does not ensure that the XOR values match.
   - The program does not handle the case where no suitable pairs are found after initial selections.

3. **Printing Elements:**
   - The program prints elements directly without ensuring the XOR values match, which violates the problem constraints.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
