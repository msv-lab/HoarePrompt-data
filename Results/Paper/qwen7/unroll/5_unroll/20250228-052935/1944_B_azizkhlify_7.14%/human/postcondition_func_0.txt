The function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, along with two integers n and k. It prints pairs of numbers from the first half of the list and single occurrences from the first half based on the value of k. After that, it prints the collected single occurrences and finally pairs from the second half of the list, ensuring the total number of printed pairs and single occurrences matches the specified k. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.
