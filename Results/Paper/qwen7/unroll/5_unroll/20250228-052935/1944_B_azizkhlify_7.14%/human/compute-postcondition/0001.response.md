Output State: The output consists of multiple lines, each representing the results of one test case. For each test case, it first prints pairs of numbers from the list `a` that appear twice, up to `k` pairs. If there are fewer than `k` pairs found, it prints the remaining single occurrences of numbers from `a`. After that, it prints the remaining single occurrences of numbers again. The specific numbers printed depend on the input values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.
