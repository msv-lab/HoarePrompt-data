Output State: **`char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in `b` is mapped to a character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`; `s` is an empty string.**

The code `s = ''` initializes an empty string `s`. This does not affect the `char_map` dictionary, which remains unchanged from its initial state.
