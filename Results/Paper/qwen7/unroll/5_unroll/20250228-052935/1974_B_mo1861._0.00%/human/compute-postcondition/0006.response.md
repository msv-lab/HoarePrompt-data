Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `c`, which is iterating over the elements of `b`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `c`**: Since `c` is iterating over the elements of `b`, the loop will start with the first element of `b`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `b`**: The dictionary `char_map` is defined based on the unique characters in `b`. Therefore, `b` must contain at least one unique character for the loop to execute.

4. **Initial state of `char_map`**: `char_map` is already defined as a dictionary where each unique character in `b` is mapped to a character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`. This state does not need adjustment because it is derived from `b`.

5. **Initial state of `s`**: `s` is an empty string, and this state does not affect the loop's execution since the loop body is omitted.

Based on the above steps, the only state that needs adjustment is `b` to ensure that it contains at least one unique character.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`b` must contain at least one unique character`**
