You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of b is at most 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that b is the result of encoding some string s according to the given algorithm.
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
        char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
        
    #State: Output State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in `b` is mapped to a character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`. Specifically, the character with the highest frequency in the sorted unique set of `b` will map to 'z', the next highest to 'y', and so on, until the least frequent maps to 'a'.
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    #State: Output State: `char_map` is a dictionary mapping each unique character in `b` to a character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`; `s` is a string that is the concatenation of `char_map[c]` for each `c` in `b`.
    return s
    #The program returns a string `s` which is formed by replacing each character in `b` with another character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s` where each character in `b` is replaced by another character from 'z' to 'a' based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string `s` which is formed by replacing each character in `b` with another character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
