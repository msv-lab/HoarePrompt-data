The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and it is set to the integer value of the input. Since `t` is guaranteed to be within this range, it means `t` will always be a non-zero integer (as per the given constraints).

Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute the first time because `t` is already guaranteed to be non-zero based on the given constraints.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and now `t` is set to the integer value of the input**
