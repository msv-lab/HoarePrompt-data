You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n, a, b, and c are strings of equal length n, where each character in a, b, and c is either a lowercase or uppercase letter. For each iteration of the loop, if the conditions specified in the code are met, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The final output state is determined by the cumulative output of all iterations, with 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Template Construction**:
   - The program constructs a template based on the characters of `a` and `b`. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, it appends `a[i]` to the template. Otherwise, it appends the uppercase version of `a[i]`.
   
2. **Matching Conditions**:
   - It checks if both `a` and `b` match the constructed template:
     - If the character in the template is lowercase, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` should match the template.
     - If the character in the template is uppercase, neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` should match the lowercase version of the template.
   - It also checks if `c` does not match the template:
     - If the character in the template is lowercase, `c[i]` should not match the template.
     - If the character in the template is uppercase, `c[i]` should match the lowercase version of the template.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where `a[i]` and `b[i]` differ but do not affect the final template construction.
   - The logic for checking if `a` and `b` match the template seems correct.
   - The logic for checking if `c` does not match the template seems correct.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" if both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, otherwise it prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- The template construction logic is correct.
- The matching conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c` are correctly implemented.
- The program handles all given examples correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
