### Reasoning:

1. **Template Construction**:
   - The program constructs a template based on the characters of `a` and `b`. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, it appends `a[i]` to the template. Otherwise, it appends the uppercase version of `a[i]`.
   
2. **Matching Conditions**:
   - It checks if both `a` and `b` match the constructed template:
     - If the character in the template is lowercase, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` should match the template.
     - If the character in the template is uppercase, neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` should match the lowercase version of the template.
   - It also checks if `c` does not match the template:
     - If the character in the template is lowercase, `c[i]` should not match the template.
     - If the character in the template is uppercase, `c[i]` should match the lowercase version of the template.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where `a[i]` and `b[i]` differ but do not affect the final template construction.
   - The logic for checking if `a` and `b` match the template seems correct.
   - The logic for checking if `c` does not match the template seems correct.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" if both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, otherwise it prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- The template construction logic is correct.
- The matching conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c` are correctly implemented.
- The program handles all given examples correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
