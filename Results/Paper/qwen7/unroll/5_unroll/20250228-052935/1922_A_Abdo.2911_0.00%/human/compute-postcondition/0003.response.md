Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n, a, b, and c are strings of equal length n, where each character in a, b, and c is either a lowercase or uppercase letter. For each iteration of the loop, if the conditions specified in the code are met, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The final output state is determined by the cumulative output of all iterations, with 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration.
