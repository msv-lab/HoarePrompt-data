Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Template Construction**: For each character in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, the program constructs a template:
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, the template uses the lowercase version of that character.
   - If they are different, the template uses the uppercase version of the character from `a`.
3. **Validation**:
   - It checks if both `a` and `b` match the constructed template.
   - It also checks if `c` does not match the template.
4. **Output**: Based on the validation, it prints "YES" if the conditions are met, otherwise "NO".

The logic in the program correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.
