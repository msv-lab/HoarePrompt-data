Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (length of strings), and three strings a, b, and c (each of length n). For each test case, it constructs a template string based on the comparison of characters in a and b. It then checks if the template matches a and b but does not match c. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The final output consists of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.**
