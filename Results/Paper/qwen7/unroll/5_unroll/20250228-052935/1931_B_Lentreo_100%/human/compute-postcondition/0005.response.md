Output State: **`n` is the length of `nums`, and the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`, `total` is the sum of `nums`, `mean` is `total // n`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the mean of the list `nums` by performing integer division of the total sum of `nums` by `n`. Since the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`, the result of `total // n` is an integer. This integer value is assigned to the variable `mean`. The other variables (`n`, `total`) retain their original values as they are not affected by the code.
