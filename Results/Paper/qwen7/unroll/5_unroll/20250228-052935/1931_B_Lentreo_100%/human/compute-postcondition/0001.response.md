Output State: **`n` is the length of `nums`, and the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`, `total` is the sum of `nums`.**

Explanation: The code `total = sum(nums)` calculates the sum of the list `nums` and assigns it to the variable `total`. The initial conditions that `n` is the length of `nums`, and the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n` remain true after the execution of the code. The variable `total` now holds the sum of the elements in `nums`.
