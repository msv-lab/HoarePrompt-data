Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sum Check**: It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers `n`. If not, it immediately returns "NO".
3. **Mean Calculation**: It calculates the mean amount of water per container.
4. **Balance Check**: It iterates through the containers and ensures that the cumulative difference from the mean remains non-negative. If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it returns "NO". Otherwise, it returns "YES".

Given the constraints and the logic, the program handles all valid cases correctly. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
