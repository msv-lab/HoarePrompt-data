Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to the result of one test case. For each test case, if \( b > a \), the output will be the sum of an arithmetic sequence starting from \( b \) with a common difference of 1, truncated to the first \( k \) terms, plus the product of \( a \) and the remaining terms. If \( b \leq a \), the output will simply be \( a \times n \). Here, \( k \) is the minimum value between \( n \) and \( b - a \).

This output state describes the results of processing each test case according to the given loop logic.
