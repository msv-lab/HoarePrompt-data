Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It calculates `k` as the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. This is correct because `k` represents the number of buns to be sold at the modified price.
4. The condition `if b <= a` checks whether the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`. If true, it means there's no benefit in applying the promotion, so all buns are sold at the usual price `a`, which is correctly calculated as `a * n`.
5. If `b > a`, the program calculates the profit using the formula:
   - The sum of the arithmetic sequence starting from `b` with a common difference of 1, truncated to the first `k` terms, which is `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`.
   - The remaining buns are sold at the usual price `a`, which is `(n - k) * a`.
6. The final output matches the expected results for each test case as described in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program logic is correct and matches the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
