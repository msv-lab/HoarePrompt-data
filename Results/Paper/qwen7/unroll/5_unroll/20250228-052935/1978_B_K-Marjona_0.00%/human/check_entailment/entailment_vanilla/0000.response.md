Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `k` is initialized as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This means `k` is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price while ensuring the modified price is greater than or equal to the usual price `a`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - If `b <= a`, the program prints `a * n`. This is correct because if the modified price is less than or equal to the usual price, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price to maximize profit.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the profit using the formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a`.

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The term `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k` calculates the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`.
   - The term `(n - k) * a` calculates the profit from selling the remaining buns at the usual price `a`.

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
   - Profit = `5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 4`
   - Profit = `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35` (Correct)

3. **Example 3**: `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
   - `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0`
   - Profit = `10 * 10 = 100` (Correct)

4. **Example 4**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
   - Profit = `11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45` (Correct)

5. **Example 5**: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
   - `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0`
   - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000` (Correct)

6. **Example 6**: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1`
   - `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000) = 0`
   - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000` (Correct)

7. **Example 7**: `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
   - `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
   - Profit = `1000 + 999 + ... + 2 + 1 + 1000 * 1 = 500500` (Correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
