Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not match the problem description and the expected behavior.
2. The program initializes `soma` to 0 and then iterates `N` times, reading an integer `n` each time, but it calls `func_1(i)` for each `i` in the range of `n`, which is not the intended logic.
3. According to the problem, for each `n`, we need to replace each integer from 1 to `n` with the sum of its digits and then compute the sum of these new values.
4. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a number, but it is being called incorrectly in the main loop.
5. The main loop should iterate over the numbers from 1 to `n` and add the result of `func_1(i)` to `soma`.

Given these points, the annotated program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
