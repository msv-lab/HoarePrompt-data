Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads `N` test cases but only processes one test case inside the loop. It should process each test case independently.

2. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the sum of digits of a number, but it is called incorrectly within the loop. The loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`, and `func_1(i)` is called for each `i`. This means it sums the digits of all numbers from `0` to `n-1`, which is not what the problem requires. The problem states that Vladislav writes the integers from `1` to `n`.

3. **Suggested Correct Implementation**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n` and calculate the sum of the digits of each number from `1` to `n`.
   - Print the result for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    current_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        current_sum += sum_of_digits(i)
    results.append(current_sum)

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version ensures that each test case is processed independently and calculates the sum of the digits for each number from `1` to `n` as required.
