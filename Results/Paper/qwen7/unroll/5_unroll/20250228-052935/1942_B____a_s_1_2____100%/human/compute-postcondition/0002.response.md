Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each iteration of the loop, n is an integer, and a is a list of n integers. After all iterations, p is a list of integers where each element p[i] is calculated as mex - a[i], with mex being the minimum value greater than or equal to 0 that has not appeared in the list p up to index i.
