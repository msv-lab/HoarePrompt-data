Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by constructing a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). The program iterates backward through the array \( a \) and calculates each element of \( p \) using the formula \( p[i] = \text{mex} - a[i] \), where \( \text{mex} \) is the smallest non-negative integer not yet present in the permutation \( p \).

However, there are a few issues with this approach:

1. **Initialization of `mex`:** The variable `mex` is initialized to \( n \), which is the size of the array. This initialization might not correctly reflect the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current state of \( p \).

2. **Updating `mex`:** The variable `mex` is updated by taking the minimum of itself and the current value of \( p[i] \). This update step is problematic because it doesn't correctly maintain the smallest non-negative integer not present in \( p \). Instead, it should be updated based on the values already assigned to \( p \).

3. **Backward Iteration:** The backward iteration through \( a \) and the calculation of \( p \) based on \( \text{mex} \) might not correctly ensure that \( \text{mex} \) is the smallest non-negative integer not present in \( p \).

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to construct the permutation \( p \) based on the given constraints.

Correctness: **False**
