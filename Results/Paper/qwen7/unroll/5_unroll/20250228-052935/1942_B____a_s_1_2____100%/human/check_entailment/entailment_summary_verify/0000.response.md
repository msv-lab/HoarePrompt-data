### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). The logic for calculating the MEX value and assigning values to the permutation \( p \) is indeed flawed. 

Let's analyze the original program step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `p` with `-1` for all indices and sets `mex` to `n`.
2. **Backward Iteration**: It iterates backward through the array `a` and assigns values to `p` based on the current `mex` value.
3. **Update `mex`**: It updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the value assigned to `p[i]`.

However, this approach does not guarantee that each integer from 0 to \( n-1 \) appears exactly once in \( p \). The MEX value is not correctly handled, and the assignment logic can lead to incorrect permutations.

The provided corrected version addresses these issues:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `p` with `-1` for all indices and creates a set `used` to keep track of used values.
2. **Forward Iteration**: It iterates forward through the array `a` and assigns values to `p` based on the current MEX value.
3. **Update `mex`**: It calculates the MEX value by incrementing until it finds a value not in `used`, ensuring each value from 0 to \( n-1 \) is used exactly once.

This corrected version ensures that each element in \( p \) is assigned a unique value from 0 to \( n-1 \) and that the MEX value is correctly calculated.

Given the corrected version provided, the original assessment is accurate. The original program is incorrect, and the corrected version fixes the issue.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program, after being corrected, is now correct according to the problem description and the function summary.
