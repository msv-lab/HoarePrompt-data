### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **inaccurate**. Let's analyze the provided program and the corrected version step-by-step.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)
```

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `p` with `-1` for all indices and sets `mex` to `n`.
2. **Backward Iteration**: It iterates backward through the array `a` and assigns values to `p` using the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`.
3. **Update Mex**: It updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly assigned value `p[i]`.

#### Issues with the Provided Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The provided program incorrectly calculates the MEX value and assigns values to `p`. The logic for updating `mex` and ensuring that each element in `p` is unique is flawed.
- **Backward Iteration**: The backward iteration does not guarantee that each integer from 0 to \( n-1 \) will be assigned exactly once.

#### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        used = set()
        for i in range(n):
            mex = 0
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex
            used.add(mex)
        print(*p)
```

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `p` with `-1` for all indices and uses a set `used` to track which integers have been used.
2. **Forward Iteration**: It iterates forward through the array `a` and assigns values to `p` using the formula `p[i] = mex` where `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `used`.
3. **Update Used Set**: It adds the assigned value to the `used` set to ensure uniqueness.

#### Analysis:
- **Correct MEX Calculation**: The corrected program correctly calculates the MEX value and ensures that each integer from 0 to \( n-1 \) is assigned exactly once.
- **Forward Iteration**: The forward iteration guarantees that each integer is assigned in a sequential manner, ensuring the permutation properties are maintained.

Given the analysis, the original assessment incorrectly identified the program as incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the MEX calculation and the assignment process. The corrected version provided in the assessment is indeed correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program, when corrected, constructs the permutation \( p \) correctly based on the given array \( a \).
