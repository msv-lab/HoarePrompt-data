Reasoning:

1. The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) such that for each index \( i \), \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
2. The provided solution attempts to solve this by iterating backward through the array \( a \) and calculating \( p[i] = \text{mex} - a[i] \).
3. The variable `mex` is initialized to \( n \) and updated within the loop to ensure it always holds the minimum value between the current `mex` and the calculated value \( \text{mex} - a[i] \).
4. This approach ensures that each \( p[i] \) is correctly set to the value that satisfies the condition \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
5. The backward iteration guarantees that the MEX calculation is done correctly for each position in the array.

Given the logic and the steps taken in the provided code, it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
