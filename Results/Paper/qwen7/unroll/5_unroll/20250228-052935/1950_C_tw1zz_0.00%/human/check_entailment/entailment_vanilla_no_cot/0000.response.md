Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because it uses a very inefficient and redundant method to convert 24-hour format to 12-hour format. The program manually checks each possible hour value and assigns the corresponding 12-hour format and AM/PM indicator. This can be simplified significantly using modulo arithmetic.

Here is a more efficient version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        h1 = str((int(h) % 12) or 12)  # Convert 24-hour hour to 12-hour format
        time = 'AM' if int(h) < 12 else 'PM'
        print(f'{h1}:{m} {time}')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This version uses the modulo operator to handle the conversion from 24-hour to 12-hour format and simplifies the logic for determining AM/PM.
