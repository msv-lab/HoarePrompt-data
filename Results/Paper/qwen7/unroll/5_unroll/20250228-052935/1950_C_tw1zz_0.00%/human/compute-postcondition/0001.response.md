Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a time in the 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. For each input time in the 24-hour format "hh:mm", the script converts "hh" to its equivalent 12-hour format value and appends "AM" or "PM" accordingly. The minutes "mm" remain unchanged. The output will include all possible times from 12:00 to 11:59 in both AM and PM formats, as the loop will process each possible input time within the given constraints.
