Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, so its value doesn't matter for the loop to execute.
   - The expression `int(input())` reads an integer from the input. This integer represents the number of iterations the loop will run.

3. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. Since the loop runs for each integer read from the input, the input must be at least 1.
   - The initial state of `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), but this state is not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition.

4. **Formulate the final state**:
   - The loop will execute as long as the input is a positive integer. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that the input is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and the input must be a positive integer**
