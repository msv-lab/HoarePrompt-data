Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the beauty of the array. The `func_1` function calculates the beauty of the array based on the sorted order, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty. For example, consider the input:

```
3
4 1 3 2
```

The correct approach would be to sort the array and then calculate the beauty, but this might not always yield the maximum beauty. A better approach would be to place the smallest element at the beginning and the largest at the end, and then alternate between the smallest and largest remaining elements. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

Here's an example where the program fails:
- Input: `3 4 1 2`
- Expected output: By sorting and calculating, the output should be `5` (since the beauty is calculated as `(4-3) + (1-4) + (2-1) = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5`).
- Actual output: The program sorts the array and calculates the beauty as `(1-4) + (2-1) + (3-2) = -3 + 1 + 1 = -1`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
