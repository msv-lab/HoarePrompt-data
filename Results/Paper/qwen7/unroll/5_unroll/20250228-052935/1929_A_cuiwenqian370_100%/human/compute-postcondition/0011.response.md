Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter t, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two parameters: n, a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and array, a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a value of `n` and an array of integers, without specifying what kind of processing or output is generated from these inputs.
