Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: The initial state given is:
   - `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string received from standard input
   - `index` is 1
   - `results` is an empty list

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is initially set to `int(data[0])`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to adjust the state such that the loop can start executing. This means ensuring that `t` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, data is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string received from standard input, index is 1, results is an empty list**
