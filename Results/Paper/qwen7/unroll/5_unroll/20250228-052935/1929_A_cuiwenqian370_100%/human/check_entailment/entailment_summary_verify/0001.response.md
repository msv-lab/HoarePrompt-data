### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key insight that sorting the array maximizes the beauty. However, there is a subtle issue in the implementation of `func_1` that affects the correctness of the program.

#### Key Points from the Original Assessment

1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements, maximizing the positive differences.
2. **Calculating Beauty**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements after sorting.
3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` correctly reads input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Identified Issue

The issue lies in the calculation of the beauty. When sorting the array, the beauty is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. However, the absolute value is not necessary because the array is sorted in ascending order. Therefore, the differences will always be non-negative, and taking the absolute value is redundant.

#### Correct Implementation

The correct implementation should directly sum the differences without using the `abs` function since the array is sorted.

### Corrected Code

```python
# Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += array[i] - array[i - 1]
    return beauty

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

### Verification

Let's verify the corrected implementation with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input:
  ```
  5
  3
  2 1 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Execution:
  - After sorting, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - Beauty = \( (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2 \).

#### Example 2:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  69 69 69
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  0
  ```

- Execution:
  - The array is already sorted.
  - Beauty = \( (69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0 \).

#### Example 3:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5
  100 54 80 43 90
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  57
  ```

- Execution:
  - After sorting, the array becomes `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`.
  - Beauty = \( (54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57 \).

#### Example 4:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4
  3 4 3 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

- Execution:
  - After sorting, the array becomes `[3, 3, 3, 4]`.
  - Beauty = \( (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \).

#### Example 5:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  2
  2 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

- Execution:
  - After sorting, the array becomes `[1, 2]`.
  - Beauty = \( (2 - 1) = 1 \).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the solution by sorting the array and calculating the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements. The original assessment was accurate, but the implementation needed a small correction to remove the unnecessary use of the `abs` function.

**Final: True**
