### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
The problem requires us to split the array \(a\) (represented by the string `expression`) into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

#### Program Code Analysis:
1. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(expression, result_length)`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the string `expression` and the length of `expression`.
   - It splits the string based on the '-' character and calculates the number of segments.
   - It then counts the number of times the balance (initially set to 0) goes below zero while iterating through each character in `expression`.
   - If the final balance is greater than 0, it adds 1 to the count.
   - The function returns this final count.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the penalty calculation. Instead, it simply counts the number of times the balance goes below zero and adds 1 to the count if the final balance is positive. This does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the total penalty.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
- The expected output is `4`.
- The program will split the string into `["--", "+++++", "-"]`.
- The function `func_1` will count the number of segments, which is 3.
- However, the actual penalty calculation should be:
  - Penalty for `--`: \(2 \times |-2| = 4\)
  - Penalty for `+++++`: \(5 \times |5| = 25\)
  - Penalty for `-`: \(1 \times |-1| = 1\)
  - Total penalty: \(4 + 25 + 1 = 30\)

The program's output is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the penalties for the subarrays.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment should be maintained.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
