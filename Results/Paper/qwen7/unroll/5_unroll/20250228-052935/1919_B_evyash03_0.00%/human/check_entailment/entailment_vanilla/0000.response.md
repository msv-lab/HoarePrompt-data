Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `length` and the string `expression`.

2. **Splitting the String:**
   - The string `expression` is split into parts using `'-'` as the delimiter.
   - This results in a list of substrings where each substring does not contain any `'-'` character.

3. **Calculating Result Length:**
   - The variable `result_length` is calculated as the sum of the lengths of these substrings.
   - This step seems unnecessary because the problem doesn't require calculating `result_length` directly.

4. **Calling `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with `expression` and `result_length` as arguments.
   - However, `func_1` only uses `expression` and ignores `result_length`.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` iterates through each character in `expression`.
   - It maintains a `balance` which tracks the cumulative sum of `+1` for `'+'` and `-1` for `'-'`.
   - If `balance` becomes negative, it increments `count` and resets `balance` to 0.
   - Finally, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Objective:** The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` into subarrays.
- **Penalty Calculation:** The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
- **Optimal Splitting:** To minimize the penalty, we should ideally split the array into subarrays where the sum of each subarray is zero or close to zero.

### Issues in the Given Program

1. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` does not actually calculate the penalty as required by the problem statement.
   - Instead, it counts the number of splits needed to ensure no subarray has a negative balance, which is not equivalent to minimizing the penalty.

2. **Misunderstanding of the Problem:**
   - The function `func_1` does not handle the actual penalty calculation correctly. It simply counts the number of splits where the balance goes negative, which is not the optimal strategy for minimizing the penalty.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
