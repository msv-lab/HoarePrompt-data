Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter c, which is a list of integers. The length of the list n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, and each element a_i in the list satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. After executing the function body, the function returns 0.**

This means the function `func_1` takes a list `c` of integers as input, where the list's length is between 1 and 18, and each integer in the list is between 0 and 10^7. Regardless of the content of the list, the function always returns 0.
