Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements of the array `a` using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
2. Each operation involves setting all elements in a subarray from index `l` to `r` to the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of that subarray.
3. The provided code does not actually implement the logic to find the MEX and update the array. Instead, it uses hardcoded values for the sum and number of operations.
4. The function `func_1` is defined but never called with the actual length of the array `a`. The hardcoded logic inside `func_1` does not depend on the input array `a`.
5. The hardcoded outputs do not account for the actual input array `a` and thus cannot be considered correct for arbitrary inputs.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
