### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
- Each operation involves setting a subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of that subarray.

#### Given Program:
```python
a = []
n = int(input())
sa = input()
na = sa.split()
for ai in na:
    a.append(ai)
func_1(len(a))

def func_1(c):
    m = 0
    if c == 2:
        print(f'4 1')
        print(f'1 2')
    else:
        print(f'13 0')
    return
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1(c)` checks if the length of the list `c` is exactly 2.
  - If true, it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2".
  - Otherwise, it prints "13 0".

#### Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the length of the array `n` and then reads the array elements into a list `a`.
   - However, the elements of `a` are read as strings and appended to the list. This needs to be converted to integers.

2. **Function Logic:**
   - The function `func_1(c)` is hardcoded to handle only the case when the length of the array is 2.
     - For `c == 2`, it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2".
     - For any other length, it prints "13 0".
   - This function does not process the actual array `a` or compute the MEX values and apply the operations to maximize the sum.

3. **Output Validation:**
   - For the input:
     ```
     2
     0 1
     ```
     The expected output is:
     ```
     4 1
     1 2
     ```
     The program correctly outputs this.
   - For the input:
     ```
     3
     1 3 9
     ```
     The expected output is:
     ```
     13 0
     ```
     The program correctly outputs this.
   - For the input:
     ```
     4
     1 100 2 1
     ```
     The expected output is:
     ```
     105 2
     3 3
     3 4
     ```
     The program incorrectly outputs:
     ```
     13 0
     ```
     This is incorrect because the maximum sum can be achieved by setting all elements to 100, resulting in a sum of 400.

4. **General Case Handling:**
   - The function `func_1(c)` does not handle the general case where the length of the array is not 2 or 1. It always prints "13 0" for lengths other than 2, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. It hardcodes the output for specific lengths of the array without actually processing the input. This means it will not work for general cases where the input array length is different from 2 or 1. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
