### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its behavior based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements of the array `a` by performing up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
   - Each operation involves setting all elements in a subarray from index `l` to `r` to the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of that subarray.
   - The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the set.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself from the input.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the length of the array `n`.
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle different cases based on the length of the array `c` (which is passed as an argument).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - If the length of the array `c` is 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`.
   - If the length of the array `c` is not 2, it prints `13 0`.

4. **Behavior and Correctness**:
   - The function `func_1` does not actually compute the MEX or modify the array `a` in any way.
   - It simply prints hardcoded values based on the length of the array `c`, which is not dependent on the actual contents of the array `a`.
   - For example, for an array of length 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`, which implies that the MEX operation results in all elements being set to 2. However, this does not necessarily maximize the sum of the array.
   - For arrays of other lengths, it prints `13 0`, implying that no operations are needed, which is also not necessarily true.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - In the first example, the input is `[0, 1]`. The program prints `4 1` and `1 2`, which means it sets the entire array to 2. This is incorrect because the MEX of `{0, 1}` is 2, but the optimal solution would be to set the array to `{2, 2}` directly, resulting in a sum of 4.
   - In the second example, the input is `[1, 3, 9]`. The program prints `13 0`, which is correct because the MEX of `{1, 3, 9}` is 0, and setting the array to `{0, 0, 0}` results in a sum of 0, which is the maximum possible sum for this specific input.
   - In the third example, the input is `[1, 100, 2, 1]`. The program prints `105 2` and performs the operations `3 3` and `3 4`, which is incorrect because the optimal solution would be to set the entire array to 100, resulting in a sum of 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 = 400.

Based on the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the MEX and update the array to maximize the sum. The hardcoded outputs do not account for the actual input array and thus cannot be considered correct for arbitrary inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
