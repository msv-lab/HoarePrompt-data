Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000.
2. It then iterates through each test case, reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.
3. The program checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`).
4. If the conditions for a stair are met, it prints 'STAIR'.
5. If the conditions for a peak are met, it prints 'PEAK'.
6. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.
7. The logic implemented matches the problem statement exactly.

Given the provided example and the logical flow of the code, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
