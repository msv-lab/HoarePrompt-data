Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50. The list `k` contains `N` integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20.**

Explanation: The code `N = int(input().strip())` reads an integer from the input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace (though `.strip()` is often unnecessary for integer inputs), and assigns it to the variable `N`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and was not referenced or modified in the given code snippet. The list `k` is not affected by this code.
