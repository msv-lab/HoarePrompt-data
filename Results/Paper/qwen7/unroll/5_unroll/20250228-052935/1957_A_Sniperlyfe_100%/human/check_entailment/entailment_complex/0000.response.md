Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from the given sticks, where each polygon's sides must be formed by exactly one stick and no stick can be reused.
2. A regular polygon with \( k \) sides requires \( k \) sticks of the same length.
3. The provided solution attempts to solve this by counting the frequency of each stick length and then determining how many complete sets of three (since a triangle is the smallest regular polygon) can be formed from these frequencies.
4. However, the logic in the function `func_1` is flawed because it does not correctly account for the possibility of forming polygons with more than three sides. For example, it should consider squares (4 sides), pentagons (5 sides), etc., but the current implementation only considers triangles.
5. The function should calculate the minimum number of complete sets of the smallest polygon (triangle) that can be formed from each unique stick length, and then sum these values to get the total number of polygons.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution is incorrect because it only considers triangles and does not account for other possible polygons.

Correctness: **False**
