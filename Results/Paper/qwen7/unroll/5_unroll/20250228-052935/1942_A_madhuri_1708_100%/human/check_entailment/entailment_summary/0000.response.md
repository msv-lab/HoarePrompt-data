Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the case when \( k \geq 2 \) and \( n = k \). It prints a line with the integer \( k \) repeated \( k \) times, which ensures that all cyclic shifts are sorted.
2. The program correctly handles the case when \( k \geq 2 \) and \( n \neq k \). It prints `-1`, indicating that no such array exists.
3. The program handles the case when \( k < 2 \) by printing a sequence of integers from 1 to \( n \). This approach is valid because:
   - For \( k = 1 \), it guarantees exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the original array).
   - For \( k = 0 \), it ensures no sorted cyclic shifts, which is also valid since the program outputs `-1` in this scenario.
4. The program reads input from standard input, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
