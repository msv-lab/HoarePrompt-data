The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it checks the relationship between \( n \) and \( k \):
- If \( k \geq 2 \) and \( n = k \), it prints a line containing the integer \( k \) repeated \( k \) times.
- If \( k \geq 2 \) and \( n \neq k \), it prints `-1`.
- If \( k < 2 \), it prints a line containing the integers from 1 to \( n \).

After processing all test cases, the function outputs multiple lines of text, each corresponding to a test case according to the specified conditions.
