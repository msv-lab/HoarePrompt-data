Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template that matches the conditions for strings `a` and `b` but not for string `c`. Specifically, the program checks if for each position `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, this check alone is not sufficient to determine if a valid template exists.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
2
aa
bb
ab
```

- String `a` is "aa".
- String `b` is "bb".
- String `c` is "ab".

The program will output "YES" because for each position `i`, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, there is no template that can satisfy the conditions for both `a` and `b` while failing for `c`. The correct template would be "AA" or "BB", which would make both `a` and `b` match but `c` would not match either.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to check if there exists a consistent pattern that can explain why `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. This involves checking if there is a way to assign lowercase and uppercase letters to the template such that the conditions are met.
