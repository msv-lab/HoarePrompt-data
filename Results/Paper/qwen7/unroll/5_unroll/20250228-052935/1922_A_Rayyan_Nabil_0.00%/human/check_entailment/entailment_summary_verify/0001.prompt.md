You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 1000), an integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 20), and three strings \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), each of length \( n \) containing lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it checks if for every position \( i \) (0 ≤ \( i \) < \( n \)), either \( a[i] \neq c[i] \) or \( b[i] \neq c[i] \). If this condition holds true for all positions, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, but string `c` does not.
   - A template `t` can consist of both lowercase and uppercase letters.
   - If a letter in the template is lowercase, the corresponding letter in the string must be exactly the same.
   - If a letter in the template is uppercase, the corresponding letter in the string must be different from the lowercase version of that letter.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It initializes `l` to `'YES'`.
   - It iterates over each character in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - If for any index `i`, `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, it sets `l` to `'YES'`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `l` to `'NO'`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` is incorrect.
   - This condition checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]`. However, we need to ensure that at least one of them matches `c[i]` while the other does not.
   - The correct condition should be `if a[i] == c[i] and b[i] != c[i] or a[i] != c[i] and b[i] == c[i]`.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The correct implementation should check if either `a[i]` matches `c[i]` and `b[i]` does not, or vice versa.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        valid = True
        for i in range(n):
            if (a[i] == c[i] and b[i] != c[i]) or (a[i] != c[i] and b[i] == c[i]):
                continue
            else:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a valid template. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
