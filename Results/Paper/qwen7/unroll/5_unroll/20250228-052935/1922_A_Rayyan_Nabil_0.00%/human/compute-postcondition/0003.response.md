Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `l` is 'NO'

Explanation: The variable `l` is initially set to 'YES'. Inside the loop, `l` is only changed to 'NO' if the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` is never met for any `i` in the range of `n`. Since the loop iterates `t` times and `l` is reset to 'NO' at the end of each iteration unless the condition is met, `l` will be 'NO' after all iterations unless the condition is met in every single iteration across all `t` inputs, which is not guaranteed based on the given code.
