You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `l` is 'NO'
    #
    #Explanation: The variable `l` is initialized to 'YES' at the start of each iteration of the outer loop. Inside the inner loop, the condition `if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:` is checked. If this condition is never met for any `i` within the inner loop, then `l` remains 'YES'. However, if the condition is met for any `i`, `l` is set to 'NO' and remains 'NO' for the rest of the outer loop iteration. Since the problem does not provide specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, we cannot guarantee that the condition will never be met. Therefore, the final value of `l` after all iterations is 'NO', assuming there is at least one `i` where the condition is met.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template that matches the conditions for strings `a` and `b` but not for string `c`. Specifically, the program checks if for each position `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, this check alone is not sufficient to determine if a valid template exists.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
2
aa
bb
ab
```

- String `a` is "aa".
- String `b` is "bb".
- String `c` is "ab".

The program will output "YES" because for each position `i`, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, there is no template that can satisfy the conditions for both `a` and `b` while failing for `c`. The correct template would be "AA" or "BB", which would make both `a` and `b` match but `c` would not match either.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to check if there exists a consistent pattern that can explain why `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. This involves checking if there is a way to assign lowercase and uppercase letters to the template such that the conditions are met.
