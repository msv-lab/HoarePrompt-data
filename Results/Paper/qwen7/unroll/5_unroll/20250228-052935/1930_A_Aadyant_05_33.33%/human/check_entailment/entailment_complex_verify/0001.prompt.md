You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers on the whiteboard are 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.

    #State: Output State: `out` is a list of sums, where each sum is calculated from the first element of every pair in the sorted lists provided by the user for each iteration. The length of `out` is equal to the value of `num`, and each element in `out` is an integer representing the sum of the first elements of the pairs from the sorted lists provided in each iteration.
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)
        
    #State: The output state will be a list of integers, where each integer is the sum of the first elements of the pairs from the sorted lists provided in each iteration. The length of the list is equal to the value of `num`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `num`, followed by `2*num` integers. It then sorts these integers and calculates the sum of the first elements of each pair in the sorted list. This sum is stored in a list `out`. After processing all test cases, the function prints each sum in `out`. The final state of the program is a list of integers, where each integer represents the sum of the first elements of the pairs from the sorted lists provided for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the score by selecting pairs of numbers from the list and adding the minimum of the pair to the score.
   - The goal is to perform this operation `n` times, where `2n` is the total number of integers.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `a` which is the number of pairs (i.e., `2n`).
   - It then reads a string of space-separated integers and splits them into a list `list1`.
   - The list `list1` is sorted.
   - A new list `list2` is created containing every other element from the sorted list `list1`, starting from the first element.
   - The sum of elements in `list2` is appended to the output list `out`.
   - Finally, it prints each element of `out`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The code assumes that the input is always correctly formatted and does not handle invalid inputs gracefully.
   - The logic for selecting pairs is flawed. Instead of selecting the minimum of each pair, it selects every other element from the sorted list.
   - The approach does not ensure that the minimum of each pair is selected, which is required to maximize the score.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To maximize the score, we should sort the list and then pair the smallest and largest remaining elements, ensuring the minimum of each pair is added to the score.
   - This can be achieved by iterating through the sorted list and pairing elements from both ends towards the center.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
