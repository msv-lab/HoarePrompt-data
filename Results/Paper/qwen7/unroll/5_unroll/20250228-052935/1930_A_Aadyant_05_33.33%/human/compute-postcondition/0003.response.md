Output State: `out` is a list containing `num` elements, where each element is the sum of the smallest `a` integers from the input list `list1` for each iteration of the loop. The values of `t` and `num` are unchanged, and the numbers on the whiteboard remain 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} with 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
