Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case `i` (1 <= i <= t), it takes three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` where 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and a list `a` of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100 for all i. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the given inputs.**

This means the function `func` accepts an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes additional integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of integers. The function then performs some unspecified operation based on these inputs and returns the result accordingly.
