You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the input values provided within each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, the variables `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` are updated based on user input, and the loop prints either 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' based on the conditions specified. The final state will consist of these printed outputs for each iteration, with no specific numerical values since the exact inputs are not provided.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k` (number of cubes, index of favorite cube, and number of removed cubes).
   - It then reads the values of the cubes into the list `a`.

2. **Identifying Favorite Value:**
   - The program extracts the value of the favorite cube using `a[f - 1]`. This is correct because the index `f` is 1-based.

3. **Counting Same Values:**
   - The program counts how many cubes have the same value as the favorite cube (`same_value_count`). This is necessary to understand how many cubes are in the same value group as the favorite cube.

4. **Counting Greater Values:**
   - The program counts how many cubes have a value greater than the favorite cube (`greater_count`). This helps determine if the favorite cube can be among the first `k` cubes after sorting.

5. **Decision Logic:**
   - If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means the favorite cube cannot be among the first `k` cubes after sorting, so it will definitely be removed.
   - If `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, it means there are not enough cubes with a greater or equal value to occupy the first `k` positions, so the favorite cube will not be removed.
   - Otherwise, it is possible for the favorite cube to be among the first `k` cubes after sorting, so the result is "MAYBE".

### Verification

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - `n = 5`, `f = 2`, `k = 2`, `a = [4, 3, 3, 2, 3]`
   - Favorite value: `3`
   - `same_value_count = 3`
   - `greater_count = 1`
   - Since `greater_count < k`, but `greater_count + same_value_count > k`, the output should be "MAYBE".

2. **Example 2:**
   - `n = 5`, `f = 5`, `k = 3`, `a = [5, 2, 1, 3, 4]`
   - Favorite value: `4`
   - `same_value_count = 0`
   - `greater_count = 1`
   - Since `greater_count < k`, the output should be "NO".

3. **Example 3:**
   - `n = 5`, `f = 5`, `k = 2`, `a = [5, 2, 4, 1, 3]`
   - Favorite value: `3`
   - `same_value_count = 1`
   - `greater_count = 1`
   - Since `greater_count + same_value_count > k`, the output should be "YES".
