Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed based on the given conditions. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
2. **Extracting Values**: For each test case, it extracts the number of cubes `n`, the index of the favorite cube `f`, and the number of removed cubes `k`.
3. **Favorite Cube Value**: It finds the value of the favorite cube using the index `f-1` since indexing starts at 0.
4. **Counting Same Values**: It counts how many cubes show the same value as the favorite cube.
5. **Counting Greater Values**: It counts how many cubes show a value greater than the favorite cube.
6. **Decision Making**:
   - If there are at least `k` cubes with values greater than the favorite cube, the favorite cube will definitely be removed (`print('YES')`).
   - If the sum of the count of cubes with values greater than the favorite cube and the count of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube is less than or equal to `k`, the favorite cube will never be removed (`print('NO')`).
   - Otherwise, the outcome is uncertain (`print('MAYBE')`).

Given this analysis, the program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
