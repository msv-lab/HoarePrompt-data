The function accepts a list of integers and an integer n. It modifies the list according to specific rules within a loop. For each element `list[i]` where `1 <= i <= n-2`, if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`, then `list[i]` is decreased by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i+1]` is decreased by the value of `list[i-1]`, and `list[i-1]` is decreased by itself (effectively setting it to 0). If at any point during these operations `list[i-1]` is not zero, the function prints 'no' and returns immediately. If the loop completes without printing 'no', the function calls `func_1(list, n)`. Based on the result of `func_1`, the function prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. The final state of the list is the result of all these operations.
