### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero and `False` otherwise.
   - The function is correct and straightforward. It simply iterates through the list and checks if any element is non-zero.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function iterates through the list from index 1 to n-2 (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `list[i]` can be reduced to zero using the allowed operations.
   - If `list[i]` is greater than 1, and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0, it performs the operation:
     - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
   - If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero after performing the operation, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements in the list are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is designed to ensure that if the operations can make all elements zero, it will do so.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the operations. Specifically, the operation `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]` effectively sets `list[i-1]` to 0, but the subsequent operations might not always be valid or might lead to incorrect results.
   - Consider the following scenario: suppose `list = [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`. In the first iteration of the loop with `i = 1`:
     - `list[1] = 3`, `list[0] = 1`, and `list[2] = 5`.
     - The operation would be:
       - `list[2] -= 1 * list[0]` → `list[2] = 5 - 1 = 4`
       - `list[1] -= 2 * list[0]` → `list[1] = 3 - 2 = 1`
       - `list[0] -= 1 * list[0]` → `list[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`
     - Now, `list = [0, 1, 4, 5, 2]`.
     - In the next iteration with `i = 2`:
       - `list[2] = 4`, `list[1] = 1`, and `list[3] = 5`.
       - The operation would be:
         - `list[3] -= 1 * list[1]` → `list[3] = 5 - 1 = 4`
         - `list[2] -= 2 * list[1]` → `list[2] = 4 - 2 = 2`
         - `list[1] -= 1 * list[1]` → `list[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`
     - Now, `list = [0, 0, 2, 4, 2]`.
     - In the next iteration with `i = 3`:
       - `list[3] = 4`, `list[2] = 2`, and `list[4] = 2`.
       - The operation would be:
         - `list[4] -= 1 * list[2]` → `list[4] = 2 - 2 = 0`
         - `list[3] -= 2 * list[2]` → `list[3] = 4 - 4 = 0`
         - `list[2] -= 1 * list[2]` → `list[2] = 2 - 2 = 0`
     - Now, `list = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
   - The operations seem to work in this specific case, but the issue lies in the general validity of the operations and their sequence. The operations might not always be valid or might lead to incorrect results in other scenarios.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_2` does not correctly handle all edge cases and might produce incorrect results in certain scenarios.
