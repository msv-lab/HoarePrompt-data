Based on the initial state and the operations described, let's break down the problem:

1. The list has been modified according to specific rules inside a loop.
2. For each element `list[i]` where `1 <= i <= n-2`, if certain conditions are met, the following operations are performed:
   - `list[i]` is decreased by twice the value of `list[i-1]`.
   - `list[i+1]` is decreased by the value of `list[i-1]`.
   - `list[i-1]` is set to 0.
3. If at any point during these operations `list[i-1]` is not zero, the program prints 'no' and returns immediately.
4. If the loop completes without printing 'no', the function `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`.

Given that the function `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`, it means that the loop completed without printing 'no'. This implies that for every element `list[i]` where `1 <= i <= n-2`, the conditions were not met to print 'no'.

Therefore, the print statement `print('NO')` will execute after the loop and will print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
