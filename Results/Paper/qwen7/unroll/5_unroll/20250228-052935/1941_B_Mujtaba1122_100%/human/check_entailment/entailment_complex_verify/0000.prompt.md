You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

Otherwise, it completes its execution and returns True, indicating that all elements in the list are non-zero.

#Function 2:

    #State: Output State: The list has been modified according to the rules inside the loop. For each element `list[i]` where `1 <= i <= n-2`, if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`, then `list[i]` is decreased by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i+1]` is decreased by the value of `list[i-1]`, and `list[i-1]` is decreased by itself (effectively setting it to 0). If at any point during these operations `list[i-1]` is not zero, the program prints 'no' and returns immediately. If the loop completes without printing 'no', the final state of the list is the result of all these operations.

If at any point during these operations `list[i-1]` is not zero, the program prints 'no' and returns immediately. If the loop completes without printing 'no', the final state of the list is the result of all these operations. This outcome is the same regardless of whether `func_1(list, n)` returns `True` or `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and an integer n. It modifies the list according to specific rules within a loop. For each element `list[i]` where `1 <= i <= n-2`, if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`, then `list[i]` is decreased by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i+1]` is decreased by the value of `list[i-1]`, and `list[i-1]` is decreased by itself (effectively setting it to 0). If at any point during these operations `list[i-1]` is not zero, the function prints 'no' and returns immediately. If the loop completes without printing 'no', the function calls `func_1(list, n)`. Based on the result of `func_1`, the function prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. The final state of the list is the result of all these operations.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
3
5
2 4 4 5 1
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

However, the current implementation might incorrectly output "YES" for this case. Here's why:

- In the given array `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`, the middle element `4` cannot be reduced to zero because it requires reducing both `2` and `5` to zero, which is not possible without violating the constraints of the operations.

The current implementation does not check if the sum of the array elements is even, which is a necessary condition for making all elements zero. Additionally, it does not properly handle cases where the array elements are not reducible to zero due to the constraints of the operations.

To fix this, the program should check if the sum of the array elements is even and also ensure that no element prevents the reduction process. A corrected approach would involve checking these conditions and ensuring that the operations are applied correctly to reduce the array to all zeros.
