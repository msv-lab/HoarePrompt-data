Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly parses the input and organizes the test cases.
2. The `func_1` function iterates through each column of the grid to determine if the robot can reach the last column in the second row.
3. The logic within `func_1` checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row and continue moving right until the end of the grid.
4. The function correctly updates the `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` flags based on the direction of the arrows.
5. The final output is generated correctly based on whether the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the logic appears to be sound and should work as intended for the problem statement. There are no apparent errors in the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
