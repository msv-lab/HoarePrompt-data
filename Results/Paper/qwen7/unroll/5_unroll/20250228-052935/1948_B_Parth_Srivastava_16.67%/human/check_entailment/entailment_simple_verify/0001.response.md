### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Assessment Analysis**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program:
     - The `func_1` function does not correctly split the elements into digits as per the problem statement.
     - The program does not handle the case where the array might already be sorted after splitting.
     - The program does not check if the resulting array is sorted after performing the operations.
     - The program initializes an empty list `b` but never appends any values to it within the loop that reads test cases, leading to incorrect output.

2. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code provides a clear step-by-step breakdown of the program's state, which helps in understanding its behavior.
   - The `func_1` function attempts to split the elements into digits only when the element is greater than 10 and not at the beginning of the array. However, this implementation is flawed because it does not consider the full problem requirements.
   - The function sorts the resulting list `c` and checks if it matches the original list `c`. If they match, it appends 1 to `b`; otherwise, it appends 0. This logic is flawed because it does not account for the correct digit-splitting process and sorting requirement.

3. **Detailed Issues**:
   - **Incorrect Digit-Splitting**: The function only splits elements greater than 10 and not at the beginning of the array, which is not comprehensive enough.
   - **Sorting Logic**: The function checks if the sorted list `d` (which is the same as `c`) is equal to `c`. This does not reflect the actual problem requirement of making the array sorted through the allowed operations.
   - **List Initialization**: The list `b` is initialized but never updated within the loop that reads test cases, leading to incorrect output.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It fails to properly split the elements into digits and does not correctly check if the array can be sorted through the allowed operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The digit-splitting and sorting logic are flawed, and the program does not handle the problem requirements accurately.
