Reasoning:
- The program is designed to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `a`.
- It then processes the list `a` by breaking down numbers greater than 10 into their individual digits and appending them to a new list `c`. This is done through the function `func_1()`.
- After constructing the list `c`, it checks if `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- Based on this check, it appends either 1 (if the list is sorted) or 0 (if the list is not sorted) to the list `b`.
- Finally, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the value in `b`.

However, there are some issues with the program:
1. The variable `b` is initialized outside the loop, but it should be cleared or reinitialized for each test case.
2. The function `func_1()` is called without parameters in the loop, which is incorrect since it requires `k` and `a` as inputs.
3. The logic inside `func_1()` seems to be flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the splitting of digits and appending them to `c`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
