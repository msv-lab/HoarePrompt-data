### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotated version to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find a sequence \( a \) of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
  1. No subsequence of \( a \) has a sum equal to \( k \).
  2. For all \( 1 \le v \le n \) where \( v \ne k \), there is a subsequence of \( a \) with a sum of \( v \).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
   ```
   This initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \( 2^{23} \).

2. **Finding `idx`**:
   ```python
   idx = 0
   while k >= 1 << idx:
       idx += 1
   idx -= 1
   ```
   This finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \).

3. **Modifying `nums`**:
   ```python
   nums.append(k - nums[idx])
   nums.append(k + 1)
   nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
   nums.remove(1 << idx)
   ```
   - `nums.append(k - nums[idx])`: Adds \( k - 2^{\text{idx}} \) to `nums`.
   - `nums.append(k + 1)`: Adds \( k + 1 \) to `nums`.
   - `nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)`: Adds \( k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1 \) to `nums`.
   - `nums.remove(1 << idx)`: Removes \( 2^{\text{idx}} \) from `nums`.

4. **Output**:
   ```python
   print(len(nums))
   print(*nums)
   ```

#### Detailed Analysis:
- **No Subsequence Summing to \( k \)**:
  - The sequence includes \( k - 2^{\text{idx}} \), \( k + 1 \), and \( k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1 \).
  - Any subsequence containing \( k - 2^{\text{idx}} \) and \( 2^{\text{idx}} \) would sum to \( k \), but \( 2^{\text{idx}} \) is removed, ensuring no such subsequence exists.
  - Similarly, \( k + 1 \) and \( k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1 \) do not form a subsequence summing to \( k \).

- **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to \( n \) Except \( k \)**:
  - The sequence includes \( 1, 2, 4, \ldots, 2^{23} \), covering all powers of 2.
  - By combining these powers of 2 in various ways, we can form any sum from 1 to \( 2^{24} - 1 \).
  - Since \( k - 2^{\text{idx}} \) and \( k + 1 \) are included, we can form any sum from 1 to \( n \) except \( k \).

Given the above analysis, the program correctly constructs a sequence that meets both conditions specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct as it generates a sequence that satisfies both conditions for all potential cases.
