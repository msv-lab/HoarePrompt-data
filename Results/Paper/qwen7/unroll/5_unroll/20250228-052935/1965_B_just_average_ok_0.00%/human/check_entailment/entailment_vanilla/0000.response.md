Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - It correctly reads `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Generating Sequence**:
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with values `[1 << i for i in range(24)]`. This creates a list of powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\).
   - It then finds the index `idx` such that \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
   - It removes this value from `nums` and appends `k - 2^{\text{idx}}`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1` to `nums`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of `nums`, which is at most 25.
   - It then prints the elements of `nums`.

### Checking Against Requirements

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**:
   - The sequence includes `k - 2^{\text{idx}}` and `2^{\text{idx}} + 1`, ensuring that no subsequence sums to `k`. This is because any subsequence involving `k - 2^{\text{idx}}` and `2^{\text{idx}} + 1` would include `k`.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values Except `k`**:
   - The sequence includes all powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\), plus additional values to ensure all sums from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed.
   - The sequence `nums` is designed to cover all possible sums from 1 to `n` except `k` using the properties of binary representation and the inclusion of specific values.

### Edge Cases and Constraints

- The constraints ensure that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^7\).
- The sequence generation logic ensures that the maximum length of the sequence is 25, meeting the requirement.

### Conclusion

The program correctly generates a sequence that meets the problem requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` and that all other sums from 1 to `n` can be formed.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
