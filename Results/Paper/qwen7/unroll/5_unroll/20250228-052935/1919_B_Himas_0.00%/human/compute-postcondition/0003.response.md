Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000), and a string `s` consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `n`. For each test case, it processes the string `s` and returns different outputs based on specific conditions related to `t`, `n`, and the content of `s`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and a string `s` of '+' and '-' characters. The function processes these inputs and returns results based on the given constraints and relationships between the parameters.
