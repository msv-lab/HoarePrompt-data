Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Here's why:

1. The program reads an integer `t` which is the number of test cases, but it does not handle multiple test cases as required.
2. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s`, but it only processes one character at a time to count the number of '+' and '-' characters.
3. The logic for calculating the minimum possible penalty is missing. The program simply calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters and prints this difference, which does not necessarily give the minimum penalty as per the problem statement.

Given the problem description, the program should:
- Read the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, read the length `n` and the string `s`.
- Split the string `s` into optimal parts to minimize the penalty.
- Calculate the penalty based on the optimal split and print the result.

Since the provided program does not follow these steps and does not correctly compute the minimum penalty, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
