Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and s is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length n. After the loop executes all the iterations, for each test case, P - M is printed, where P is the count of '+' characters and M is the count of '-' characters in the string e.
