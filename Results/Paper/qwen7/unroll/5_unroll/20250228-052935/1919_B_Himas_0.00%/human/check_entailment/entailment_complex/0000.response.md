Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` and outputs the difference between these counts. However, the problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty based on the optimal way to split the array `a` derived from `s`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Penalty**: The program does not account for the optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the total penalty. Instead, it just counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and outputs their difference, which is not relevant to the penalty calculation.

2. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of elements in each subarray multiplied by the length of that subarray. The program does not perform any operations to achieve the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty.

3. **Optimal Splitting**: The program should consider different ways to split the array `a` and compute the penalty for each possible split to find the minimum penalty. This involves dynamic programming or a similar approach to explore all possible splits and their penalties.

Given these points, the provided program does not solve the problem as stated and thus is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
