You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        m = 1
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)

    #- Two integers `n` and `k` were read from input.
    #- A variable `s` was initialized to 0.
    #- A variable `m` was initialized to 1.
    #- A while loop was executed where `x` was set to `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` was halved, and if `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, the loop was exited; otherwise, `s` was incremented by `x` and `m` was doubled.
    #- The result `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m` was printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `s` is initialized to 0.
   - `m` is initialized to 1.

3. **Loop to Determine the Position:**
   - The loop runs while `n` is greater than 0.
   - In each iteration:
     - `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of odd multiples of `m` (current multiplier).
     - `n` is halved (`n //= 2`), reducing the number of remaining cards.
     - If `s` (cumulative count of cards laid down) is less than `k` and `k` is within the current range `[s, s + x]`, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `s` is updated by adding `x`, and `m` is doubled (`m *= 2`).

4. **Calculating the k-th Card:**
   - After exiting the loop, the k-th card is calculated using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.

### Verification of Logic

1. **Correctness of Loop Condition:**
   - The loop correctly identifies the range of cards laid down at each step.
   - The condition `s < k and k <= s + x` ensures that the k-th card falls within the current range.

2. **Correctness of Formula:**
   - The formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m` correctly computes the k-th card based on the current multiplier `m` and the offset `(k - s)`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is exactly at the boundary of the current range correctly.
   - The program correctly handles the case when `k` is outside the current range and moves to the next multiplier.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the k-th card laid down according to the specified rules.
