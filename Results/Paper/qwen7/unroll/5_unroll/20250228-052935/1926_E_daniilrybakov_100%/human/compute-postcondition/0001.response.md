Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), the loop will always execute as long as `t` is within this range.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop**: The initial state is given as `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\). This means `t` could be any integer within this range.

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure `t` is within the specified range. Since the input is taken from user input, we need to ensure that the input value falls within the valid range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\)**
