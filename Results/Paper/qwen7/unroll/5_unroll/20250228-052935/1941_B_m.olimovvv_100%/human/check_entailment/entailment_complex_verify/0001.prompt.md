You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a consists of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a consists of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9. After executing the loop, if for every test case, the conditions `b[-1] == 0` and `b[-2] == 0` are met without encountering any negative value in the array before the loop's end, then the output will be 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it will be 'NO'. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (length of the array), and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. It then checks if all elements in the array are non-negative and if certain conditions are met after performing specific arithmetic operations on the array elements. If all conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the array from index `0` to `a-3` (since we need indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2`).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `b[i]` is negative.
     - If `b[i]` is negative, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop, indicating that it's impossible to make all elements zero.
   - It then updates the array elements according to the operation:
     - `b[i+1] -= b[i] * 2`
     - `b[i+2] -= b[i]`
     - `b[i] -= b[i]` (which effectively sets `b[i]` to 0)
   - After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the array are non-zero. If either `b[-1]` or `b[-2]` is non-zero, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Operation Application:**
   - The program incorrectly applies the operation `b[i+1] -= b[i] * 2` and `b[i+2] -= b[i]`. According to the problem statement, the correct operation should be:
     - `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`
     - `a_i = a_i - 2`
     - `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`
   - The current implementation does not follow these rules.

2. **Logic Flaw:**
   - The logic for checking if the array can be made zero is flawed. The program only checks the last two elements after the loop, but it should check if all elements are zero.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Apply the operation until no more operations can be applied
        while True:
            changed = False
            for i in range(1, a - 1):
                if b[i] >= 2:
                    b[i-1] -= 1
                    b[i] -= 2
                    b[i+1] -= 1
                    changed = True
            if not changed:
                break
        
        # Check if all elements are zero
        if all(x == 0 for x in b):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the specified operation and does not properly check if all elements can be made zero. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
