Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a consists of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9. After executing the loop, if for every test case, the conditions `b[-1] == 0` and `b[-2] == 0` are met without encountering any negative value in the array `b`, then the output will be 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it will be 'NO'. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
