Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each test case, if the first row and last row are identical and consist of the same character throughout, or if the entire first and last rows are uniform but different from each other, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The number of 'YES' and 'NO' will depend on the input provided for each test case.
