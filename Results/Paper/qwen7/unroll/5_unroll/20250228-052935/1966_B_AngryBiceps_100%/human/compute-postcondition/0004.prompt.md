You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of n and m, both positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and a grid of size n × m filled with characters 'W' and 'B'. The sum of n·m over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
            ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed based on the conditions evaluated within the loop for each test case. For each test case, if the first row and last row are identical and filled with the same character, or if the entire grid's first and last rows meet specific conditions where they are different but their characters are uniform across the respective rows, it will print 'NO'. Otherwise, it will print 'YES'. This process repeats for each test case provided by the input.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of size n x m, where n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and each cell in the grid contains either 'W' or 'B'. The function also receives a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it returns information about the grid based on certain conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
