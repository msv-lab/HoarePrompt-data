### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the game logic and the optimal strategies for both players.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Anna reverses the digits of a chosen number.
   - Sasha concatenates two chosen numbers.
   - The game ends when Sasha can no longer make a move (i.e., only one number remains).
   - Sasha wins if the remaining number is at least \(10^m\); otherwise, Anna wins.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program calculates the total number of digits (`total_digits`) in the list.
   - It counts the number of trailing zeros in the reversed form of each number using `func_1`.
   - It sorts the counts of trailing zeros in descending order.
   - It then sums every second count of trailing zeros starting from the highest.
   - Finally, it compares the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` with \(m+1\) to determine the winner.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Digits**:
   - The program splits the input string and uses the length of each split part, which is incorrect. It should consider the actual integer values directly.

2. **Handling Trailing Zeros**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts trailing zeros in the reversed form of each number.
   - However, the program incorrectly uses this information to determine the winner without considering the actual game mechanics.

3. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The program attempts to determine the winner based on the difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero`, but this does not align with the game rules.
   - The game involves strategic moves of reversing digits and concatenating numbers, which are not accurately reflected in the current logic.

4. **Missing Game Strategy**:
   - The program lacks the necessary logic to simulate the game and determine the optimal moves for both players.
   - It does not consider the possibility of Sasha winning if he can concatenate numbers to form a number greater than \(10^m\).

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the game logic and the optimal strategies for both players. It incorrectly calculates the total digits and uses the wrong criteria to determine the winner. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
