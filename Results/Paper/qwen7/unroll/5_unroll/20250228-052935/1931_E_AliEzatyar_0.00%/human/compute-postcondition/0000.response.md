Output State: **`counter` is 0**.

The initial state includes that `num` is a list of integers between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, and its length `n` satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\). Additionally, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\), and for each test case, an integer `m` is given such that \(0 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).

The code snippet `counter = 0` initializes the variable `counter` to 0. No other changes are made to the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only updated variable is `counter`, which is now 0. All other conditions and values of `num` remain unchanged.
