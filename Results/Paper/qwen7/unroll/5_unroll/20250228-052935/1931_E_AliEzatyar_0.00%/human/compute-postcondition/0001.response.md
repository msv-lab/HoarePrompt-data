Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1)`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs through the range from `len(num) - 1` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. This means the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `num`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: 
   - The variable `i` will take on values starting from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`.
   - The list `num` must have at least one element for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the initial state**:
   - Since `i` starts from `len(num) - 1`, `num` must have at least one element.
   - `counter` is not directly involved in the loop condition, but its initial value is given as 0.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `num` must have at least one element.
- `i` will start from `len(num) - 1`.
- `counter` remains 0 as it is not directly involved in the loop condition.

State: **`counter` is 0, `num` must have at least one element, `i` will start from `len(num) - 1`**
