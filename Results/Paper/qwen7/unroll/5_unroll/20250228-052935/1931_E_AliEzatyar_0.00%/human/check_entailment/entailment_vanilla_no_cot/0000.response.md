Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining the winner of the game:

1. **Incorrect Functionality of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to count trailing zeros in a string representation of a number. However, it should convert the string to an integer before counting trailing zeros. The current implementation just counts trailing zeros in the string without converting it to an integer, which can lead to incorrect results for numbers with leading zeros after reversing.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The logic for determining the winner is flawed. The solution attempts to count trailing zeros and uses this count to decide the winner, but this does not accurately reflect the game rules. The game involves strategic moves of reversing digits and concatenating numbers, and the solution should account for these moves.

3. **Handling of Test Cases:**
   - The solution processes each test case but does not correctly simulate the game or use the optimal strategy to determine the winner. It simply counts trailing zeros and makes a decision based on this count, which is not aligned with the game rules.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to simulate the game and consider the optimal moves for both players. Here is a more accurate approach:

```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test

def reverse_number(num):
    return int(str(num)[::-1])

def can_sasha_win(n, m, nums):
    # Convert all numbers to their reversed form
    reversed_nums = [reverse_number(num) for num in nums]
    
    # Sort the numbers in descending order
    reversed_nums.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Check if Sasha can win by concatenating two numbers
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            new_num = int(f"{reversed_nums[i]}{reversed_nums[j]}")
            if new_num >= 10**m:
                return True
    return False

for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_sasha_win(n, m, array):
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'

for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

This solution correctly simulates the game by reversing the numbers and checking if Sasha can concatenate two numbers to win.
