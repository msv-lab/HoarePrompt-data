### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. This involves finding a distribution of bets that satisfies the condition for all possible winning outcomes.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.
   - It calls `func_2(k)` to compute a value `m`, which is used to determine the bets.
   - It then checks if the sum of the bets is less than or equal to `m`. If so, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.
   - If the sum of the bets is less than `m`, it prints the bets.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Computes the absolute value of the product of two numbers divided by their GCD.
   - Since the inputs are between 2 and 20, the result will also be within a manageable range.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Applies `func_1` successively to the list of multipliers.
   - This effectively computes the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers because the GCD operation reduces the product and then divides by the GCD, which is equivalent to finding the LCM.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic of the main program is correct. It correctly uses the LCM to ensure the total bet is minimized while ensuring it is less than the winnings for any outcome.
   - The use of `func_1` and `func_2` to compute the LCM is appropriate and ensures the bets are calculated correctly.
   - The condition checking and output handling are also correct.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
