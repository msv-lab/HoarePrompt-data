### Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect because it misinterprets the problem and the solution provided by the given program. Let's break down the problem and the given solution step by step:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - Each outcome has a multiplier \( k_i \).
   - The goal is to find a distribution \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \) for all \( i \).

2. **Given Functions:**
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{|a \cdot b|}{\gcd(a, b)} \).
   - `func_2(numbers)`: This function computes the LCM of a list of numbers using the `func_1` function.

3. **Key Observation:**
   - For each outcome \( i \), we need \( \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j < k_i \cdot x_i \).
   - This implies that \( x_i \) should be chosen such that the sum of all \( x_j \) (for \( j \neq i \)) plus \( x_i \) is less than \( k_i \cdot x_i \).

4. **Approach:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It uses LCM calculations, which are not necessary for the problem at hand.
   - The correct solution involves finding a common value \( m \) such that \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < m \) and \( m < k_i \cdot x_i \) for all \( i \).

5. **Implementation:**
   - The program calculates the LCM of all multipliers using `func_2`.
   - It then distributes the coins such that each \( x_i = \frac{m}{k_i} \).
   - If the sum of all \( x_i \) is less than \( m \), it prints the distribution; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - If no such distribution exists, the output should be `-1`.

### Correctness Check:

- The program correctly calculates the LCM of all multipliers and then distributes the coins such that the sum of all \( x_i \) is less than \( m \).
- The program checks if the sum of all \( x_i \) is less than \( m \) and prints the appropriate output.

### Conclusion:

The given program is correct because it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program was incorrect.

**Correctness: True**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
