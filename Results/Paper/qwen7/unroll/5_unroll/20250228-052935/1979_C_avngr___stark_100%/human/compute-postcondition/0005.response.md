Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter numbers, which is a list of integers. Each integer in the list represents a multiplier \(k_i\) for the i-th outcome, and the length of the list is between 1 and 50, inclusive, with each \(k_i\) ranging from 2 to 20. The function returns the final value of result after applying another function (not specified here) successively to the elements of numbers starting from the second element.**
