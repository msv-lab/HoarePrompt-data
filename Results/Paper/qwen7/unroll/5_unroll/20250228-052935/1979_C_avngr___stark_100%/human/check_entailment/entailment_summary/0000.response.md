Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to distribute coins across different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This requires finding a distribution \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) where the sum of \(x_i\) is less than \(k_i \cdot x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Key Insight**: The key to solving this problem lies in the `func_2` function, which calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\). The LCM of these multipliers will give us the smallest number that is a multiple of all \(k_i\). By distributing the coins in multiples of this LCM, we ensure that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: Computes the absolute value of the product of two numbers divided by their GCD. This is essentially calculating the LCM of two numbers.
   - **func_2**: Iteratively applies `func_1` to compute the LCM of a list of numbers. Given the constraints, this approach is valid and efficient.

4. **Program Logic**:
   - For each test case, it calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`.
   - It then divides this LCM by each \(k_i\) to get the number of coins to bet on each outcome.
   - If the sum of these bets is less than or equal to the LCM, it prints -1 (indicating no valid distribution). Otherwise, it prints the distribution of bets.

5. **Verification**:
   - The examples provided in the problem statement align with the logic of the program.
   - The output matches the expected results, confirming the correctness of the approach.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
