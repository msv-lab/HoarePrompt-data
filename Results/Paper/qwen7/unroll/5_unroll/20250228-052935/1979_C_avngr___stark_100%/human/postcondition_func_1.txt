The function accepts a list of integers, where each integer represents a multiplier \(k_i\) for the i-th outcome. The length of the list ranges from 1 to 50, and each integer is between 2 and 20. It then applies another function `func_1` successively to these multipliers, starting from the second element of the list, and returns the final result.
