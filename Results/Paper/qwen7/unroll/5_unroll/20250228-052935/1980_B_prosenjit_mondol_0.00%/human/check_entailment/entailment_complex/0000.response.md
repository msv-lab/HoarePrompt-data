Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cubes `n`, the index of the favorite cube `f`, and the number of removed cubes `k`.
3. It adjusts the index of the favorite cube `f` and the number of removed cubes `k` to be zero-based.
4. It then reads the values of the cubes into a list `a`.
5. The list `a` is sorted in descending order.
6. It compares the value of the `k`-th largest cube with the value of the `f`-th cube:
   - If the `k`-th largest cube is greater than the `f`-th cube, it prints 'NO'.
   - If the `k`-th largest cube is less than the `f`-th cube, it prints 'YES'.
   - If they are equal, it prints 'YES' unless the `k`-th cube is the second largest cube in the list, in which case it prints 'MAYBE'.

Given the logic and the steps outlined in the problem statement, the function appears to handle all the conditions correctly.

Correctness: **True**
