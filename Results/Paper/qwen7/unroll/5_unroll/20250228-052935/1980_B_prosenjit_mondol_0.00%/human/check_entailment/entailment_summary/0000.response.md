Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( f \), and \( k \), and adjusts \( f \) and \( k \) to be zero-indexed.
3. It then reads the list of integers \( a \) and sorts it in descending order.
4. The program compares the \( k \)-th largest element with the original value of the \( f \)-th element.
5. The logic for determining the output is as follows:
   - If the \( k \)-th largest element is greater than the \( f \)-th element, the favorite cube was not removed, so it prints 'NO'.
   - If the \( k \)-th largest element is less than the \( f \)-th element, the favorite cube was removed, so it prints 'YES'.
   - If they are equal, it checks if the \( k \)-th element is the second largest element. If it is, it prints 'MAYBE' because the favorite cube might or might not have been removed depending on the exact positions of the elements. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

Given the detailed execution summary and the provided examples, the program appears to handle all edge cases correctly as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
