The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( k \). For each test case, it generates a string based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \). If \( k = 1 \), the string consists of \( n \) repetitions of the character 'a'. Otherwise, the string contains characters from 'a' to the character corresponding to \( k \) (inclusive), repeated \( (2 - (n == 1)) \) times. The function outputs these strings for all test cases.
