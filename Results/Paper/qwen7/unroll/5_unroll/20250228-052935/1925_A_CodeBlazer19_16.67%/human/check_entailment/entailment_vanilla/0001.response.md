Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating the String `s`:**
   - The program initializes an empty string `s`.
   - It then iterates over the ASCII values from 97 (which corresponds to 'a') to `k + 97 - 1`, converting these values to their corresponding characters and appending them to `s`.

3. **Handling Special Cases:**
   - If `k == 1`, the program prints `n * s`. This means it repeats the character 'a' `n` times.
   - Otherwise, it prints `(2 - (n == 1)) * s`. This means:
     - If `n == 1`, it prints `s` once.
     - Otherwise, it prints `s` twice.

### Checking Correctness:

1. **Single Character Case (`k == 1`):**
   - When `k == 1`, the string `s` will contain only the character 'a'.
   - The output should be `n * 'a'`, which correctly forms all possible strings of length `n` using only 'a'.

2. **Multiple Characters Case (`k > 1`):**
   - The string `s` will contain the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - The output is either `s` (if `n == 1`) or `s + s` (if `n > 1`).
   - We need to check if this string `s` or `s + s` contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

### Verification:

- For `n == 1` and `k > 1`:
  - The string `s` contains `k` characters.
  - All possible strings of length 1 using the first `k` characters are already present in `s`.

- For `n > 1` and `k > 1`:
  - The string `s + s` will have `2k` characters.
  - By repeating `s`, we ensure that every possible combination of length `n` using the first `k` characters appears as a subsequence at least twice, which covers all possible subsequences of length `n`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles both cases and ensures that all required subsequences are present. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
