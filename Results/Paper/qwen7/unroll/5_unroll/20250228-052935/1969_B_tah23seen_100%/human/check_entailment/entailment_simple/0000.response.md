Reasoning:
The provided solution seems to be attempting to solve the problem by counting the cost associated with moving all '1's to the left of each '0'. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the minimum cost required to sort the binary string through cyclic shifts. The logic in the function `func_1` does not account for the actual minimum cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

To properly solve the problem, we need to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to sort the string. A correct approach would involve identifying the longest prefix that is already sorted and calculating the cost based on the positions of '0's and '1's.

Here's an explanation of why the provided solution is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The current implementation calculates a cost based on the number of '1's before each '0', which does not reflect the actual cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

2. **Lack of Cyclic Shift Logic**: The solution does not implement the logic to perform cyclic shifts or determine the minimum number of shifts required to sort the string.

Given these points, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
