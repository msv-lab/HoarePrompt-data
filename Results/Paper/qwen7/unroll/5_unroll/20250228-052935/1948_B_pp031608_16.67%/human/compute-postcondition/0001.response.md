Output State: **The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list 'lst' is sorted in ascending order, which is the same as 'sorted_lst'.**

This means the program checks if the list `lst` is already sorted in the same order as `sorted_lst`. If `lst` is sorted in ascending order, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
