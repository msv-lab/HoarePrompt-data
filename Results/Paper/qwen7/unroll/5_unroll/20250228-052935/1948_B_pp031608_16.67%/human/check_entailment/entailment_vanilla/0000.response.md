Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic is encapsulated in a loop that iterates through the elements of the array starting from the second element (`p`).
   - The function `func_1` is called to check if the array is already sorted.
   - If the array is not sorted, it checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if the previous element is at least 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its individual digits and rearranges the array accordingly.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the array is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as arrays with repeated elements or arrays that become invalid after splitting (e.g., resulting in negative numbers or leading zeros).

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Elements:**
   - The program attempts to split elements only when the previous element is greater than the current element and is at least 10.
   - This logic is incomplete because it does not consider all possible operations that could be performed (e.g., splitting any element that is at least 10, regardless of the order).

2. **Infinite Loop Potential:**
   - The program does not guarantee termination. If the array cannot be sorted through the allowed operations, it may enter an infinite loop due to repeated calls to `func_1` without making progress.

3. **Missing Handling of Digits Greater Than 10:**
   - The program only considers splitting elements into their digits if they are at least 10. However, the problem statement allows splitting any element that is at least 10, regardless of its position.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The output should be "YES" or "NO" in uppercase or lowercase. The program prints "Yes" or "No", which is acceptable but not strictly correct according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
