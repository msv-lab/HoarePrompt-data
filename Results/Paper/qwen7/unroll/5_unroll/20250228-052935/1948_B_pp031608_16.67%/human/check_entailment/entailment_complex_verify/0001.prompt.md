You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list 'lst' is sorted in ascending order, which is the same as 'sorted_lst'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers (`lst`) where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50. After sorting the list in ascending order, it checks if the original list is equal to the sorted list. If they are equal, it returns `True`, indicating the list was already sorted; otherwise, it returns `False`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic is encapsulated in a loop that iterates through the elements of the array starting from the second element (`p`).
   - The function `func_1` is called to check if the array is already sorted.
   - If the array is not sorted, it checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if the previous element is at least 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its individual digits and rearranges the array accordingly.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the array is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as arrays with repeated elements or arrays that become invalid after splitting (e.g., resulting in negative numbers or leading zeros).

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Elements:**
   - The program attempts to split elements only when the previous element is greater than the current element and is at least 10.
   - This logic is incomplete because it does not consider all possible operations that could be performed (e.g., splitting any element that is at least 10, regardless of the order).

2. **Infinite Loop Potential:**
   - The program does not guarantee termination. If the array cannot be sorted through the allowed operations, it may enter an infinite loop due to repeated calls to `func_1` without making progress.

3. **Missing Handling of Digits Greater Than 10:**
   - The program only considers splitting elements into their digits if they are at least 10. However, the problem statement allows splitting any element that is at least 10, regardless of its position.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The output should be "YES" or "NO" in uppercase or lowercase. The program prints "Yes" or "No", which is acceptable but not strictly correct according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
