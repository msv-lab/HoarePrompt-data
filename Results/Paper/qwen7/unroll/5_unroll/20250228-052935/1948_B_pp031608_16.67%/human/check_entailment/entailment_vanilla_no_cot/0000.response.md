Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Function `func_1` is never defined**: The function `func_1` is called but never defined in the code. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Incorrect logic for the main loop**: The main loop does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not handle the splitting and reinsertion of digits properly. The current implementation simply checks if the list is sorted without performing the necessary operations.

3. **Incorrect condition for sorting check**: The condition `if not func_1(list1):` is incorrect because `func_1` is not defined. Even if it were defined, the condition should be checking if the list is not sorted, and then attempting to sort it by splitting and reinserting digits.

4. **Splitting and reinserting digits**: The logic for splitting and reinserting digits is missing. The program should iterate through the list and check if any element is greater than or equal to 10, then split it into its digits and reinsert them.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    def func_1(lst):
        sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
        return lst == sorted_lst
    
    while True:
        sorted_list = sorted(list1)
        if list1 == sorted_list:
            print('Yes')
            break
        for p in range(len(list1)):
            if list1[p] >= 10:
                a = list1[p]
                list1.pop(p)
                list1.insert(p, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p + 1, a % 10)
                break
        else:
            print('No')
            break
```

This corrected version includes the definition of `func_1`, iterates until the list is sorted, and correctly handles the splitting and reinsertion of digits when an element is greater than or equal to 10.
