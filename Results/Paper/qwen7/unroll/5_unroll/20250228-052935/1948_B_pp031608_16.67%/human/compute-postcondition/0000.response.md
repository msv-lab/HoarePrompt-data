Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50; `sorted_lst` is a sorted version of `lst`**.

The code sorts the list `lst` and assigns the sorted list to `sorted_lst`. The original properties of `lst` regarding the range of its elements and the length of the list remain unchanged. The new variable `sorted_lst` contains the sorted version of the original list `lst`.
