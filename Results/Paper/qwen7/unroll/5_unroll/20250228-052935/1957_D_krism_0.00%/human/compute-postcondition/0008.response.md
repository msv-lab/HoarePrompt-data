Output State: **`pre` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two zeros; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers; `prefix` is a list where each element at index i (starting from 0) is the XOR of all elements in `arr` from index 0 to i.**

The code initializes a list `pre` with 32 inner lists, each containing two zeros. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `prefix` remain unchanged from their initial state.
