Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the value of n is inputted by the user; `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user, splits the line into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then creates a list of these integers. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
