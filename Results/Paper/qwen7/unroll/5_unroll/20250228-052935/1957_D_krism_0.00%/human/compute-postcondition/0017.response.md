Based on the initial state provided:

- `suf[j][0]` contains the count of positions in `prefix` where the `j`-th bit is 0.
- `suf[j][1]` contains the count of positions in `prefix` where the `j`-th bit is 1.

For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j]` will be a list with two elements: `[suf[j][0], suf[j][1]]`.

To describe the output precisely, we need to consider the structure of `suf`:

- There are 32 entries in `suf` (one for each bit position from 0 to 31).
- Each entry `suf[j]` is a list with two elements: the count of 0s and the count of 1s at the `j`-th bit position in `prefix`.

Given this, the output will be a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements representing the counts of 0s and 1s for each bit position.

Output: **[[suf[0][0], suf[0][1]], [suf[1][0], suf[1][1]], ..., [suf[31][0], suf[31][1]]]**
