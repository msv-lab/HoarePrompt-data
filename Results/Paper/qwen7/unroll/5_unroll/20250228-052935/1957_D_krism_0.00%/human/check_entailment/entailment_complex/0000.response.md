Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It constructs the prefix XOR array, which is crucial for calculating the required condition.
3. The `pre` and `suf` arrays are used to store the counts of zeros and ones for each bit position, which helps in efficiently calculating the number of valid tuples.
4. The logic inside the function seems to correctly update the `pre` and `suf` arrays as it iterates through the prefix XOR values.
5. The final answer is calculated by iterating through each position and using the counts stored in `pre` and `suf`.

Given the detailed annotations and the steps involved, the program appears to follow the correct logic to solve the problem as described. However, without the actual implementation of `func_1`, we cannot verify the exact correctness of the logic. Based on the provided information and the logical flow, the program should be correct.

Correctness: **True**
