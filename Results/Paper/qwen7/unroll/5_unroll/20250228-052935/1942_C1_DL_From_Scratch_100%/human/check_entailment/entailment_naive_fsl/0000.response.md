Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program attempts to count the number of gaps between consecutive chosen vertices, which is not a valid approach to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

To maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces, we need to ensure that the chosen vertices and the additional vertices (if any) allow us to form as many triangles as possible without any intersections. The current implementation does not consider the geometric properties of the polygon and the placement of vertices to form triangles.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
4 2 0
1 3
```
The correct answer should be 2, as we can form two non-intersecting triangles by connecting the vertices (1, 2, 3) and (3, 4, 1). However, the program will incorrectly count the gaps and return 0, as there are no gaps of length greater than 1.

Thus, the program does not handle the problem correctly and fails to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
