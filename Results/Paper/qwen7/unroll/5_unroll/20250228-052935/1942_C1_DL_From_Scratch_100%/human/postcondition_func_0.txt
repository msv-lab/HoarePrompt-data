The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it calculates a specific value based on a given list of integers. It sorts the list and counts the number of gaps of exactly 1 between consecutive elements, and additionally counts one more gap if the gap between the smallest element in the list and 1, or between the largest element and n, is exactly 1. Finally, it prints the result for each test case, which is the count plus \(x - 2\), where \(x\) is the number of elements in the list.
