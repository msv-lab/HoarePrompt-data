Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to consider scenarios where no two consecutive friends form a pair where both friends' best friends are the same and thus require separate invitations. Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

Consider the input:
```
4
2 3 4 1
```
According to the problem description, the output should be `3` because Monocarp needs to send invitations to friends 1, 2, and 3 to ensure that at least two friends come to the party. However, the current implementation only checks for a specific pattern (`l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1`) and prints `2` if this condition is met, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should consider all possible pairs and ensure that the minimum number of invitations is sent to satisfy the condition.
