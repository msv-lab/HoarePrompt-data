Reasoning:
The given solution does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Here's why:

1. **Operation Description**: The problem allows selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring all squares within the subrectangle defined by those two squares. However, the provided solution only checks if the first row is uniform and different from the last row, or if any row is uniform and different from its corresponding first or last row. This does not cover all possible operations and configurations.

2. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - **First Test Case**: `2 1\nW\nB`
     - The first row is uniform but different from the last row, so the solution prints 'NO', which is correct.
   - **Second Test Case**: `6 6\nWWWWBW\nWBWWWW\nBBBBWW\nBWWWBB\nWWBWBB\nBBBBWB`
     - The solution should check if it's possible to make all squares the same color through the allowed operations. The provided solution incorrectly prints 'NO' because the first row is not uniform and different from the last row, even though it is possible to make all squares white with the given operations.
   - **Third Test Case**: `1 1\nW`
     - The solution prints 'YES', which is correct since the entire grid is already uniform.
   - **Fourth Test Case**: `2 2\nBB\nBB`
     - The solution prints 'YES', which is correct since the entire grid is already uniform.
   - **Fifth Test Case**: `3 4\nBWBW\nWBWB\nBWBW`
     - The solution prints 'YES', which is correct since the entire grid is already uniform.
   - **Sixth Test Case**: `4 2\nBB\nBB\nWW\nWW`
     - The solution prints 'YES', which is correct since the entire grid is already uniform.
   - **Seventh Test Case**: `4 4\nWWBW\nBBWB\nWWBB\nBBBB`
     - The solution prints 'NO', which is incorrect because it is possible to make all squares the same color with the given operations.
   - **Eighth Test Case**: `1 5\nWBBWB`
     - The solution prints 'YES', which is correct since the entire grid is already uniform.

Given the analysis, the solution fails to correctly determine if it is possible to make all squares the same color using the allowed operations. It only checks specific conditions that do not cover all possible scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
