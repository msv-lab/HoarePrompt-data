Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing each row in the list `a`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `first_row` and `last_row` are initialized to store the first and last elements of each row in the grid.
   - `first_row` and `last_row` are constructed by iterating through the grid and appending the first and last elements of each row, respectively.

3. **Conditions Check**:
   - The program checks if the first row (`a[0]`) is uniform (all elements are the same) but different from the last row (`a[-1]`).
     - If this condition is true, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to make all squares the same color if the first and last rows are different.
   - Similarly, it checks if the first column (`first_row`) is uniform but different from the last column (`last_row`).
     - If this condition is true, it also prints "NO" for the same reason.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "YES".

### Problem Description Analysis:

- The problem allows any two squares of the same color to be selected, and all squares within the subrectangle defined by these two squares will be colored the same.
- The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color.

### Issues in the Given Program:

1. **Incorrect Conditions**:
   - The conditions check whether the first row or the first column is uniform but different from the last row or last column, respectively. This is not a sufficient condition to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform.
   - The logic fails to consider other configurations where the grid can still be made uniform even if the first and last rows/columns are not uniform.

2. **Lack of General Strategy**:
   - The program does not provide a general strategy to check if the entire grid can be made uniform. It only checks specific edge cases (first and last rows/columns).

### Example Counter-Case:

Consider the following grid:
```
BWBW
BWBW
BWBW
BWBW
```

- The first row and last row are not uniform, and neither are the first and last columns.
- However, it is possible to make the entire grid uniform by performing the following operations:
  - Select (1,1) and (4,1) to color the first column.
  - Select (1,2) and (4,2) to color the second column.
  - Continue similarly for the rest of the columns.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if the entire grid can be made uniform. The conditions it checks are insufficient and do not cover all possible scenarios.

### Correctness:
**False**
