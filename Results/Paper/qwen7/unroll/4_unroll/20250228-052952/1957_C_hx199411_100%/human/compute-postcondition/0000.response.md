Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), after executing the code, `t` retains this property, being an integer within the specified range. All other variables remain unchanged and retain their initial state, which is unspecified but implied to be consistent with the precondition.
