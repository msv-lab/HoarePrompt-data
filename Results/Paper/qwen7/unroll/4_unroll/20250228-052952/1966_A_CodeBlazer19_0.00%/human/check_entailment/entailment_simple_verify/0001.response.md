### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of cards left after performing an operation any number of times. The operation involves choosing `k` cards with the same number and exchanging them for `k-1` new cards.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and a list of card numbers.
   - It then prints `k - 1` without considering the actual distribution of card numbers.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in the code does not account for the actual distribution of card numbers. It simply prints `k - 1` for every test case, regardless of the card numbers.
   - This means the code will always output `k - 1` as the result, which is incorrect because the actual minimum number of cards left depends on the distribution of card numbers.

4. **Examples**:
   - For the first example (`5 3` and `[4, 1, 1, 4, 4]`), the expected output is `2`, but the code outputs `2 - 1 = 1`.
   - For the second example (`1 10` and `[7]`), the expected output is `1`, but the code outputs `10 - 1 = 9`.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly states that the code prints `k - 1` for each test case, but it does not mention that this is incorrect. The annotation confirms that the code does not consider the actual distribution of card numbers, which is indeed the issue.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem because it does not consider the actual distribution of card numbers. It always outputs `k - 1`, which is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
