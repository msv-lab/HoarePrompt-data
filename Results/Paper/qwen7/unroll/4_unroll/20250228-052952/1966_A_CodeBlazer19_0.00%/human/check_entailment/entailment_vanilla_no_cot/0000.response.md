Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program simply prints `k - 1` for every test case, which is not the correct approach. According to the problem statement, the goal is to minimize the number of cards left after performing the specified operations any number of times. The program should count how many unique card values there are, as this will determine the minimum number of cards that can remain. If there are multiple cards with the same value, they can be grouped and reduced according to the rules provided. The current implementation does not account for this logic.
