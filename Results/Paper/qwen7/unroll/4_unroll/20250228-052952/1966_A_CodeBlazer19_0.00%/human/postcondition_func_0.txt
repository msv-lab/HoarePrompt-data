The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \), followed by a list of \( n \) integers \( c \). It then prints the value \( k - 1 \) for each test case. The final state of the variable \( t \) remains unchanged, but the function outputs \( k - 1 \) for each test case.
