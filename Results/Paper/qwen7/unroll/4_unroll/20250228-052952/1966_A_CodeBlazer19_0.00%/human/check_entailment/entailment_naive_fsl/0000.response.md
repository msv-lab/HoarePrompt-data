Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem description, we need to minimize the number of cards by exchanging groups of `k` identical cards for `k-1` new cards. However, the given program simply prints `k - 1` regardless of the input, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```

The correct solution should analyze the frequency of each card and determine the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further. In this case, the output should be `2`, as we can exchange the three `4`s for two new cards, leaving us with two `1`s and two new cards, resulting in a total of 2 cards.

The provided program fails to account for the actual distribution and reduction of cards, hence it is incorrect.
