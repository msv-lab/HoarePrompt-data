You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: extroverts is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, and universals is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals.
def func_1(extroverts, universals):
    if (extroverts % 3 != 0) :
        if (extroverts % 3 + universals < 3) :
            return None
            #The program returns None
        #State: extroverts is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, and universals is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals. The current value of extroverts is not divisible by 3, and (extroverts % 3 + universals) is greater than or equal to 3
    #State: `extroverts` is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, and `universals` is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals. If `extroverts` modulo 3 is not equal to 0 and `(extroverts % 3 + universals)` is greater than or equal to 3, then the condition holds true. Otherwise, no change is made to the values of `extroverts` and `universals`.
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    #The program returns the ceiling value of (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, given that extroverts modulo 3 is not equal to 0 and (extroverts % 3 + universals) is greater than or equal to 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, both non-negative integers. It checks if `extroverts` modulo 3 is not equal to 0 and if `(extroverts % 3 + universals)` is greater than or equal to 3. If these conditions are met, it returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals)` divided by 3. Otherwise, it returns None.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: introverts, extroverts, and universals are non-negative integers such that 0 <= introverts, extroverts, universals <= 10^9.
def func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals):
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
    #The program returns -1 if `ret` is None, otherwise it returns the value of `introverts` plus the value of `ret`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters (`introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`) and calls another function `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments. If the result of `func_1` is `None`, the function returns `-1`; otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the result of `func_1`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals and another extrovert. Specifically, consider the test case `1 4 1` (1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 1 universal):

- According to `func_1`, for 4 extroverts and 1 universal, the function returns `ceil((4 + 1) / 3) = 2`. This means 2 tents are allocated for these 5 people.
- However, this leaves 2 extroverts without a tent, as they cannot form a group of 3 with the remaining universal.

Thus, the program incorrectly outputs `2` instead of `-1` for this case. Therefore, the program is not correct.
