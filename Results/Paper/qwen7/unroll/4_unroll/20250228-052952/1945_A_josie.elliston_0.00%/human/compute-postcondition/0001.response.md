Output State: **The program returns -1 if `ret` is None, otherwise it returns the value of `introverts` plus the value of `ret`.**

Given the initial state:
- `extroverts` is decreased by the value returned by `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.
- `universals` is unchanged.
- `ret` is the value returned by `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.

The code checks if `ret` is `None`. If `ret` is `None`, the program returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and `ret`.

Since the exact values of `introverts` and `ret` are not provided, the output state is described as above.
