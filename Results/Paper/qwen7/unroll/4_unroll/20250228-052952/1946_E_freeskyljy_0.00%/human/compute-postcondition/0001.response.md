Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, L is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list called `L`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. The values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are not mentioned in the initial state and are not used or modified by the given code, so they are not included in the output state.
