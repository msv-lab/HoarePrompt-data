Reasoning:
- The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it correctly checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`, which is correct because an odd sum cannot be achieved by the given scoring rules (each game results in an even score distribution).
- If the sum is even, it calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents half of the total points scored by the three players combined.
- It then calculates `y` as `a + b`, which represents the points scored by the first two players combined.
- The function prints the minimum value between `x` and `y`. This is the correct approach because the maximum number of draws can be calculated by considering the points distributed between the first two players and the remaining points that must be distributed as wins/losses.
- Given the constraints and the problem statement, the function logic appears to be sound and should produce the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
