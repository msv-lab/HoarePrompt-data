State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 500**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t` from the expression `range(t)`.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` requires `t` to be a non-negative integer.
- Additionally, since `t` is constrained to be between 1 and 500 inclusive, it must satisfy this condition.
- Therefore, the state before the loop starts should reflect that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 500.
