The function processes multiple test cases, each involving three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within specified ranges. It checks if the sum of these integers is even. If the sum is even, it calculates the minimum value between half of the sum (rounded down) and the sum of \(a\) and \(b\). If the sum is odd, it outputs \(-1\). The function reads the number of test cases from the input, processes each case according to the described logic, and prints the result for each case.
