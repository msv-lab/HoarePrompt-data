Output State: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. After executing the loop, the variable ans contains the value calculated based on the conditions inside the loop for each test case, and is printed for each test case. The variables l, r, st, and end are reset to their initial values at the start of each iteration of the loop.
