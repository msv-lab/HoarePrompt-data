Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on specific conditions involving the lengths of consecutive identical elements at the beginning and end of the list \( a \). Specifically, it determines the maximum length of consecutive identical elements at the start and end of the list, subtracts this maximum from the total length of the list, and adjusts the result if the first and last elements of the list are identical.**
