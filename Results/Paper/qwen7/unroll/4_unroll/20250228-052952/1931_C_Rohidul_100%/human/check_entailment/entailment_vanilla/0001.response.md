Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Initialization**:
   - `le` is initialized to `n`, which is the length of the array.
   - `(l, r)` are initialized to `(0, n - 1)`, representing the leftmost and rightmost indices of the array.
   - `(st, end)` are initialized to `(1, 1)`, which will be used to count the lengths of segments where the array elements are the same.

3. **Left Segment Calculation**:
   - A while loop runs until `l < r` and checks if the current element at index `l` is the same as the next element (`a[l] == a[l + 1]`).
   - If true, it increments `l` and increases `st` by 1. This counts the length of the segment where the elements are the same starting from the beginning of the array.

4. **Right Segment Calculation**:
   - Another while loop runs until `r > l` and checks if the current element at index `r` is the same as the previous element (`a[r] == a[r - 1]`).
   - If true, it decrements `r` and increases `end` by 1. This counts the length of the segment where the elements are the same ending at the end of the array.

5. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost is calculated as `le - max(st, end)`. This formula tries to minimize the cost by considering either the left or right segment where the elements are the same.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same (`a[0] == a[-1]`), it recalculates the cost as `max(0, le - (st + end))`.

6. **Output**:
   - The result is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Check:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If the array is already uniform, the cost should be 0.
  - If the array has a uniform segment at the start or end, the cost should be calculated correctly.
  - If the array has a uniform segment in the middle, the cost should be calculated correctly.

- **Logic Verification**:
  - The logic for counting the uniform segments seems correct.
  - The cost calculation considers both the left and right segments and chooses the minimum cost.
  - The special case where the first and last elements are the same is handled correctly.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is correct and handles the problem as described. The program correctly calculates the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using the allowed operations.

**Correctness: True**
