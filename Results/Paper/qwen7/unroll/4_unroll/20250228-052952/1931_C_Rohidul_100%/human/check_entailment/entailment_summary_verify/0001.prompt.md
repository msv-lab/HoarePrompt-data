You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        le = len(a)
        (l, r) = (0, n - 1)
        (st, end) = (1, 1)
        while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
            l += 1
            st += 1
        while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
            r -= 1
            end += 1
        ans = le - max(st, end)
        if a[0] == a[-1]:
            ans = max(0, le - (st + end))
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on specific conditions involving the lengths of consecutive identical elements at the beginning and end of the list \( a \). Specifically, it determines the maximum length of consecutive identical elements at the start and end of the list, subtracts this maximum from the total length of the list, and adjusts the result if the first and last elements of the list are identical.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Initialization**:
   - `le` is initialized to `n`, which is the length of the array.
   - `(l, r)` are initialized to `(0, n - 1)`, representing the leftmost and rightmost indices of the array.
   - `(st, end)` are initialized to `(1, 1)`, which will be used to count the lengths of segments where the array elements are the same.

3. **Left Segment Calculation**:
   - A while loop runs until `l < r` and checks if the current element at index `l` is the same as the next element (`a[l] == a[l + 1]`).
   - If true, it increments `l` and increases `st` by 1. This counts the length of the segment where the elements are the same starting from the beginning of the array.

4. **Right Segment Calculation**:
   - Another while loop runs until `r > l` and checks if the current element at index `r` is the same as the previous element (`a[r] == a[r - 1]`).
   - If true, it decrements `r` and increases `end` by 1. This counts the length of the segment where the elements are the same ending at the end of the array.

5. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost is calculated as `le - max(st, end)`. This formula tries to minimize the cost by considering either the left or right segment where the elements are the same.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same (`a[0] == a[-1]`), it recalculates the cost as `max(0, le - (st + end))`.

6. **Output**:
   - The result is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Check:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If the array is already uniform, the cost should be 0.
  - If the array has a uniform segment at the start or end, the cost should be calculated correctly.
  - If the array has a uniform segment in the middle, the cost should be calculated correctly.

- **Logic Verification**:
  - The logic for counting the uniform segments seems correct.
  - The cost calculation considers both the left and right segments and chooses the minimum cost.
  - The special case where the first and last elements are the same is handled correctly.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is correct and handles the problem as described. The program correctly calculates the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using the allowed operations.
