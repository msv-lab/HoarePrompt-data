You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Program:
from collections import deque
import math

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if k >= sum(nums):
        return n
    (a, b) = (math.ceil(k / 2), k // 2)
    ans = 0
    s_a = 0
    s_b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s_a += nums[i]
        s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
        if s_a <= a:
            ans += 1
        if s_b <= b:
            ans += 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts three parameters: `n`, a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5; `k`, a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^15; and `nums`, a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. It returns either the value of `n` or the count of indices `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) such that the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` or the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b`, where `a` is the ceiling value of `k / 2`, and `b` is the floor value of `k // 2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships. Specifically, the program incorrectly counts the number of ships sunk by the Kraken. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Attack Simulation**: The program attempts to simulate the Kraken's attacks by checking the sum of the durability values from the start and end of the list. However, this approach does not accurately reflect the Kraken's behavior. The Kraken repeatedly attacks the first and last ships until their durability reaches zero, and then moves on to the next available ship.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `4 5 1 2 4 3`, the expected output is `2` because the first and last ships are sunk after the first two attacks, and the remaining ships are not attacked further.
   - The program, however, incorrectly calculates the number of ships sunk. It sums up the durability values from both ends and checks if they are less than or equal to the number of attacks, which does not simulate the actual sequence of attacks.

To illustrate, let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement:
- Initial state: `[1, 2, 4, 3]`
- After 1st attack: `[0, 2, 4, 3]` (first ship sunk)
- After 2nd attack: `[0, 2, 4, 2]` (last ship sunk)
- After 3rd attack: `[0, 1, 4, 2]` (first ship sunk again)
- After 4th attack: `[0, 1, 3, 2]` (last ship sunk again)
- After 5th attack: `[0, 0, 3, 2]` (first ship sunk again)

The correct number of ships sunk is 2, but the program incorrectly counts more ships.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the Kraken's attack sequence and thus is incorrect.
