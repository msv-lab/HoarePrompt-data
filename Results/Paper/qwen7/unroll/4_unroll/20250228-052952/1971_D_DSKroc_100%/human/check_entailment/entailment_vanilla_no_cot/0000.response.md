Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Counting of Cuts**: The current logic counts the number of transitions (changes from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0) in the string. However, this approach doesn't always give the minimum number of cuts required to sort the string.

2. **Handling Sorted Strings**: The code incorrectly increments `count` even when the string is already sorted. For example, for the input `"00000000"`, the code outputs `1` instead of `1` (which is correct).

3. **Logic for Minimum Cuts**: To solve this problem, we need to identify the positions where the string changes from 0 to 1. Each such change indicates a potential cut point. We also need to ensure that the last segment contains only 1s.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        last_zero_index = -1
        
        # Find the index of the last '0' in the string
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '0':
                last_zero_index = i
        
        # Count the number of segments formed by the last '0'
        for i in range(last_zero_index + 1, len(s)):
            if s[i] == '1':
                count += 1
        
        print(count + 1)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Finding the Last Zero**: We find the index of the last '0' in the string.
2. **Counting Segments**: Starting from the position after the last '0', we count the number of '1's. Each '1' encountered after the last '0' indicates a new segment.
3. **Adding One**: Since we need to account for the last segment containing only '1's, we add 1 to the count.

This approach ensures that we get the minimum number of cuts required to sort the binary string.
