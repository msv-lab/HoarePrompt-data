Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9, where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` is now an input integer. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged, specifically, the description of the test cases for `n`, `a`, and `b` remains valid.
