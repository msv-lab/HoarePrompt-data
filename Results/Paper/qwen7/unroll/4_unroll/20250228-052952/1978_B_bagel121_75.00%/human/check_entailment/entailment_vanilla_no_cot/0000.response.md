Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns under the given promotion rules. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Case When Usual Price is Greater Than or Equal to Modified Price**:
   - If `a >= b`, then the best strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This is handled correctly by the program with `print(n * a)`.

2. **Case When Modified Price is Greater Than Usual Price**:
   - If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price `(b - i + 1)` for `i` from `1` to `k`.
   - It uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to compute the total revenue from the first `k` buns: `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - It then calculates the revenue from the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`: `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
   - Finally, it sums these two values to get the total profit and prints it.

The program handles all edge cases and examples provided in the problem statement accurately. Therefore, the given program is correct.
