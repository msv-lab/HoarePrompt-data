Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The program checks if the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`. If so, it calculates the profit as `n * a`, which is correct because there would be no benefit in applying the promotion.
4. If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal value of `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns available or the difference between `b` and `a`.
5. It then calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`. The formula used for the first part of the profit calculation is correct, as it sums up an arithmetic series.
6. Finally, the program prints the total profit for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps taken by the program, it appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
