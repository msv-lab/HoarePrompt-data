Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; `a` is a sorted list where each element is (num - 1) for each num in the original list `a`; `present` is a set containing all elements from the list `a` minus one; `ans` is x - 2 + number of iterations where `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `present` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `present`; `gaps` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a` plus `n` if it's the last element, modulo `n`; `gaps` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `gaps.sort()` sorts the list `gaps`. This operation does not affect any other variables or their ranges. It only changes the order of elements within the `gaps` list to be in ascending order.
