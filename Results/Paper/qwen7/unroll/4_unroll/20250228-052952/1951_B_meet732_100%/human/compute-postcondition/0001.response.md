Output State: **`ind` is an empty list, `a` is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and 1 <= k <= n where k is the index of the cow you own; x is the k-th element of list a.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `ind`. The values of `a`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged from the initial state.
