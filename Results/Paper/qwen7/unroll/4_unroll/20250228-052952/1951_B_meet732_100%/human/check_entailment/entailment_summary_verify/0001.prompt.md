You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k -= 1
    print(func_1(l))

def func_1(a):
    x = a[k]
    ind = []
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:
            ind.append(i)
            c += 1
        if c == 2:
            break
    if ind == []:
        return n - 1
    if len(ind) == 1:
        if ind[0] == 0:
            return k - 1
        if ind[0] > k:
            return ind[0] - 1
        return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
    if ind[0] == 0:
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
    if k > ind[1]:
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list `a` of distinct integers representing cow ratings and an index `k` (1 <= k <= n). It searches for indices of at most two cows with ratings greater than the k-th cow's rating. Based on the number of such cows found and their positions, it returns a specific value. If no such cows are found, it returns a value related to the last cow's index. If only one such cow is found, it returns a value based on the position of this cow relative to `k`. If two such cows are found, it returns a value based on their positions relative to each other and `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
       l = list(map(int, input().split()))
       k -= 1
       print(func_1(l))
   ```
   - This part correctly reads the number of test cases, the number of cows `n` and the cow's index `k`, and the ratings of the cows.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the list of ratings.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(a):
       x = a[k]
       ind = []
       c = 0
       for i in range(n):
           if a[i] > x:
               ind.append(i)
               c += 1
           if c == 2:
               break
       if ind == []:
           return n - 1
       if len(ind) == 1:
           if ind[0] == 0:
               return k - 1
           if ind[0] > k:
               return ind[0] - 1
           return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
       if ind[0] == 0:
           return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
       if k > ind[1]:
           return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
       return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])
   ```

   - **Finding Positions Greater than `x`:**
     - The loop iterates through the list `a` and collects indices where the rating is greater than `x` (the rating of the cow at position `k`).
     - If there are more than 2 such positions, it breaks early, but this condition is never checked in the rest of the function, so it's effectively ignored.
   
   - **Handling Different Cases:**
     - **Case 1:** If no positions have a rating greater than `x`, the function returns `n - 1`. This is incorrect because the cow would lose all matches if no other cow has a higher rating.
     - **Case 2:** If there is exactly one position with a rating greater than `x`:
       - If this position is at index 0, the function returns `k - 1`. This is incorrect because the cow could potentially win the first match.
       - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`. This logic seems flawed because it doesn't consider the possibility of swapping.
     - **Case 3:** If the first position with a rating greater than `x` is at index 0, the function returns `min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)`. This is also incorrect because it doesn't fully consider the optimal strategy.
     - **Case 4:** Other cases are handled similarly, but the logic is still flawed and incomplete.

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the number of wins for the cow at position `k`. It fails to consider the optimal strategy for swapping positions and handling various edge cases properly.
