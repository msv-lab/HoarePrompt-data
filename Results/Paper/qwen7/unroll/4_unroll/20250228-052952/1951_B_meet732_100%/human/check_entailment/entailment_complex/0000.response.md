Reasoning:
The function `func_1` aims to find the maximum number of matches the k-th cow can win by considering the positions and ratings of the cows. The logic in the function is designed to handle different scenarios based on the number of cows with higher ratings than the k-th cow and their positions.

1. **Case with No Higher-Rated Cows**: If there are no cows with a higher rating than the k-th cow, the function returns `n - 1`, which is incorrect according to the problem statement. The correct value should be `0` because the k-th cow cannot win any matches if no other cow has a higher rating.

2. **Case with One Higher-Rated Cow**: If there is exactly one cow with a higher rating than the k-th cow:
   - If this cow is in position 0, the function returns `k - 1`, which is correct.
   - If this cow is in a position greater than k, the function returns `ind[0] - 1`, which is also correct.
   - If this cow is in position 0 and k is greater than 0, the function returns `max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)`, which simplifies to `k` and is correct.

3. **Case with Two Higher-Rated Cows**: If there are two cows with higher ratings:
   - If the first higher-rated cow is in position 0, the function returns `min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)`, which is correct.
   - If k is greater than the second higher-rated cow, the function returns `max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])`, which is correct.
   - Otherwise, the function returns `max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])`, which is correct.

Given these observations, the function does not correctly handle the case when there are no higher-rated cows, leading to an incorrect output.

Correctness: **False**
