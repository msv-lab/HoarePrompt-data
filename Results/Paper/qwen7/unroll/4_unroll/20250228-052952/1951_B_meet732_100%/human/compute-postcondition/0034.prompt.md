You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: a is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and 1 <= k <= n where k is the index of the cow you own.
```
def func_1(a):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns a value that is 1 less than the value of c, where c is either 2 or less than 2 depending on whether the condition c == 2 was met during the loop.

Case_2: The program returns k - 1

Case_3: The program returns a value that is 1 less than the index in list `ind`, where the cow rating is greater than the k-th element of list `a`.

Case_4: The program returns the maximum value between k - 0 and 0 - 1, which simplifies to the maximum value between k and -1. Since k is an element from the list `a` and assuming k is a non-negative integer, the result will be k.

Case_5: The program returns the minimum value between the second element of list `ind` minus 1 and `k` minus 1, given that `ind` contains indices of at most two elements from list `a` where the corresponding cow ratings are greater than the k-th element of list `a`, and `ind` is not an empty list with its first element being 0.

Case_6: The program returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (ind[1] - ind[0]), where ind[0] is not 0 and the length of ind is not 1, and the current value of k is greater than the element at index ind[1] in list a.

Case_7: The program returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (k - ind[0]) given that ind[0] is not 0, the length of ind is not 1, and k is less than or equal to ind[1].

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
In your response strictly use the format: Functionality: **the functionality you calculate.**, and describe this functionality in Natural language easily understandable by humans
