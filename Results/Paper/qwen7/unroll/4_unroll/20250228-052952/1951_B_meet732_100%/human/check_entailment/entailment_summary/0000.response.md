Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum number of matches that cow \( k \) can win by potentially swapping its position with another cow.
2. The provided solution attempts to find up to two cows with ratings greater than the \( k \)-th cow's rating and uses these to determine the maximum number of wins.
3. However, the logic in the `func_1` function does not correctly handle all scenarios, particularly when there are more than two cows with ratings greater than the \( k \)-th cow's rating.
4. The function only considers up to two such cows and does not account for the possibility of swapping the \( k \)-th cow with a cow that has a higher rating than the first two cows found.
5. Additionally, the function does not consider the case where the \( k \)-th cow can win all matches if it is the highest-rated cow.

Given these points, the current implementation is incomplete and does not cover all necessary scenarios to solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
