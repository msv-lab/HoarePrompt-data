Reasoning:

The given program aims to calculate the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') appears at least \(m\) times across all rounds. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of problems \(n\), the number of rounds \(m\), and the string \(s\) representing the difficulties of the existing problems.
   
2. **Counting Existing Problems**: Using `Counter`, the program counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string \(s\).

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed**:
   - For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', the program checks if the current count is less than \(m\).
   - If the count is less than \(m\), it adds the difference (\(m - \text{current count}\)) to the answer.
   - Since the program considers the requirement for each difficulty level independently, it ensures that the total number of additional problems needed is calculated correctly.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program logic matches the requirements. It correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
