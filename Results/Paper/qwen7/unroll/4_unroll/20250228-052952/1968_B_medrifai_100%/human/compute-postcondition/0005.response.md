Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two integers `i` and `j`. It returns the value of `j` plus the index of the starting position of `a[i]` in the substring of `b` starting from index `j`. If `a[i]` is not found in the substring of `b` starting from index `j`, it returns -1.**
