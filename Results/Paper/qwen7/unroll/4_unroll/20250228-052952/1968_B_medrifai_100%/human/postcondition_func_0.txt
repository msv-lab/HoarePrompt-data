The function accepts two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two integers `i` and `j`. It searches for the character `a[i]` in the substring of `b` starting from index `j`. If the character is found, it returns the value of `j` plus the starting index of `a[i]` within the substring of `b`. If the character is not found, it returns `-1`.
