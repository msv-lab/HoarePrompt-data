Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where `n` is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, `a` is the price for one yogurt, and `b` is the price for two yogurts on promotion. The function returns the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts considering the promotional price for two yogurts.**
