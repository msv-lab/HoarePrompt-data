Let's reason through the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculation for Single Yogurt Purchase**:
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `a`, which is the price of one yogurt. This is correct because if only one yogurt is needed, there's no benefit from the promotion.

3. **Calculation for Multiple Yogurts Purchase**:
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: This represents the cost if each yogurt is bought at the regular price.
     - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`: This represents the cost if the maximum number of pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotional price, and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two values, which is the optimal cost for buying `n` yogurts.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly by printing just `a`.
   - The logic for calculating `ans2` ensures that the promotion is used optimally, considering both full pairs and any leftover single yogurt.

5. **Output**:
   - The output matches the expected format and values as shown in the example.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, considering both the regular and promotional prices. It handles all given test cases accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
