### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step using the provided annotations and the original assessment.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculation for Single Yogurt Purchase**:
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `a`, which is the price of one yogurt. This is correct because if only one yogurt is needed, there's no benefit from the promotion.

3. **Calculation for Multiple Yogurts Purchase**:
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: This represents the cost if each yogurt is bought at the regular price.
     - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`: This represents the cost if the maximum number of pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotional price, and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two values, which is the optimal cost for buying `n` yogurts.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly by printing just `a`.
   - The logic for calculating `ans2` ensures that the promotion is used optimally, considering both full pairs and any leftover single yogurt.

5. **Output**:
   - The output matches the expected format and values as shown in the example.

### Detailed Analysis Using Annotations:

- **Initial State**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).
- **First Test Case**:
  - Input: `2 5 9`
  - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
  - `ans2 = 9 * 2 // 2 + 5 * 2 % 2 = 9 + 5 = 14`
  - Output: `min(10, 14) = 9` (Correct)

- **Second Test Case**:
  - Input: `3 5 9`
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 9 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 13 + 5 = 18`
  - Output: `min(15, 18) = 15` (Correct)

- **Third Test Case**:
  - Input: `3 5 11`
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 16 + 5 = 21`
  - Output: `min(15, 21) = 15` (Correct)

- **Fourth Test Case**:
  - Input: `4 5 11`
  - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
  - `ans2 = 11 * 4 // 2 + 5 * 4 % 2 = 22 + 5 = 27`
  - Output: `min(20, 27) = 20` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, considering both the regular and promotional prices. It handles all given test cases accurately.
