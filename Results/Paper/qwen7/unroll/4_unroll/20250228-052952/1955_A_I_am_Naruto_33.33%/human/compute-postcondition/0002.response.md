Output State: The output state will consist of a series of minimum costs for purchasing different numbers of yogurts based on the given conditions. For each test case, if buying more than one yogurt, the program calculates the cost of buying each yogurt individually (ans1) or buying them in pairs with a promotion (ans2), then prints the lower of the two costs. If buying just one yogurt, it simply prints the cost of one yogurt. The process repeats for each test case provided by the input.
