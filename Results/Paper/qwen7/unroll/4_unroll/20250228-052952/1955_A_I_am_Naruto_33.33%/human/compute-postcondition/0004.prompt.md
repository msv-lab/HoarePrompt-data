You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30, where n is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, a is the price for one yogurt, and b is the price for two yogurts on promotion.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of minimum costs for purchasing different numbers of yogurts based on the given conditions. For each test case, if buying more than one yogurt, the program calculates the cost of buying each yogurt individually (ans1) or buying them in pairs with a promotion (ans2), then prints the lower of the two costs. If buying just one yogurt, it simply prints the cost of one yogurt. The process repeats for each test case provided by the input.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where `n` is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, `a` is the price for one yogurt, and `b` is the price for two yogurts on promotion. The function returns the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts considering the promotional price for two yogurts.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
