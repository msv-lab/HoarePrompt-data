### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a` and then calls `func_2(k, x, a)` to compute the desired sum after Alice and Bob's moves.
   - The function then prints the result for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function aims to find the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob make their moves.
   - It initializes a list `pos` to store possible sums and calculates the initial sum `s` of the entire array.
   - It then iterates up to `removals` times, removing the largest elements from the array and adjusting the sums `s` and `s2` accordingly.
   - In each iteration, it calculates `s - 2 * s2` and appends it to `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

3. **Optimality Consideration**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the sum, so she should remove the smallest elements.
   - Bob wants to minimize the sum, so he should multiply the largest remaining elements by -1.
   - The function `func_2()` correctly simulates these actions by removing elements and adjusting the sums accordingly.
   - The logic inside `func_2()` ensures that the maximum possible sum is computed by considering different scenarios of removals and negations.

Given that both functions correctly implement the described strategy and logic, the overall program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
