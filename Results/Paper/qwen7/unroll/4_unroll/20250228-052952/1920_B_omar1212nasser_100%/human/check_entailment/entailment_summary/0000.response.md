Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**: This function correctly processes each test case by reading the necessary inputs and sorting the array. It then calls `func_2(k, x, a)` which is designed to handle the logic for Alice and Bob's moves optimally.
2. **Function `func_2()`**: This function correctly implements the logic to find the optimal sum after Alice and Bob make their moves. It considers all possible ways Alice can remove up to `k` elements and Bob can negate up to `x` elements. The function calculates the sum of the array in different scenarios and returns the maximum possible sum.

Given the execution summaries and the problem description, both functions work together to solve the problem correctly. The `func_1()` function handles the input and output format, while `func_2()` computes the optimal sum based on the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
