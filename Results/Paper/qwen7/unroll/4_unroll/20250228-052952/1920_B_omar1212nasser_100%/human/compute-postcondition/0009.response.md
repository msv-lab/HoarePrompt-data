Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` represents the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` represents the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and `elements` is a list of integers. The function calculates a series of values based on the sum of the elements and their subsets, removing elements in each iteration and adjusting sums accordingly. It then returns the maximum value from this series of calculated values.**
