Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a` before calling `func_2()`. Sorting the array helps in determining the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob.
   - It then calls `func_2(k, x, a)` and prints the result, which is the optimal sum of the array after both players make their moves.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function takes the maximum number of elements Alice can remove (`removals`), the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1 (`negatives`), and the array `elements`.
   - It initializes `pos` to store possible sums after different strategies.
   - It calculates the initial sum `s` of the array and appends `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` to `pos`. This represents the scenario where Bob multiplies the smallest `negatives` elements by -1.
   - It then iterates up to `removals` times, updating `s` and `s2` by removing the largest elements and adjusting for Bob's potential moves.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from `pos`, which represents the best possible sum after both players make their optimal moves.

Given the logic and the steps taken by the functions, the program correctly implements the described game rules and computes the optimal sum for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
