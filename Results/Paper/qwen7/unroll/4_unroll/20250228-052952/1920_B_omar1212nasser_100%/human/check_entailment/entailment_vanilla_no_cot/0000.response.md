Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting the Array**: In `func_1`, the array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This helps in determining the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob.
3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It initializes an empty list `pos` to store possible sums after Alice removes elements and Bob multiplies some by -1.
   - It calculates the initial sum `s` of the array.
   - It iterates through the possible number of elements Alice can remove (`i` from 1 to `k`), and for each removal, it calculates the new sum considering the optimal strategy for Bob (multiplying up to `x` elements by -1).
   - For each iteration, it updates the sum `s` and the sum of the last `x` elements `s2`.
   - It appends the calculated sum to the list `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

This approach ensures that both players play optimally:
- Alice removes the smallest elements to minimize the negative impact on the sum.
- Bob multiplies the largest remaining elements by -1 to minimize the sum further.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly computes the desired sum for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
