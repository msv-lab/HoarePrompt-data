### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the logic and the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob. Let's break down the analysis step by step to ensure the correctness of the program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and sorts it.
   - Finally, it calls `func_2` with the sorted array and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Takes three parameters: `removals` (number of elements Alice can remove), `negatives` (number of elements Bob can negate), and `elements` (the sorted array).
   - Initializes a list `pos` to store possible sums.
   - Calculates the initial sum `s` of the entire array.
   - Appends the sum after removing the last `negatives` elements and negating them twice (since they are already counted in the sum).
   - Iterates up to `removals` times, updating the sum `s` and the sum `s2` of the last `negatives + i` elements.
   - In each iteration, it updates `pos` with the new sum after removing `i` elements and negating `negatives` elements.
   - Returns the maximum value in `pos`.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that Alice can remove the smallest elements first, and Bob can negate the largest elements first, which aligns with their optimal strategies.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly calculates the sum after Alice removes up to `removals` elements and Bob negates up to `negatives` elements.
   - The variable `s` keeps track of the current sum of the array.
   - The variable `s2` keeps track of the sum of the last `negatives + i` elements, which helps in calculating the effect of negating those elements.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where Alice might remove all elements or Bob might negate all elements.
   - The program correctly considers the scenario where Alice removes some elements and Bob negates some elements.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice's strategy is to remove the smallest elements to minimize the impact on the sum.
   - Bob's strategy is to negate the largest elements to minimize the sum further.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob. The logic in both functions is sound and follows the problem description accurately.

### Final Answer:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
