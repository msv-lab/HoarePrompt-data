The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), followed by a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It sorts the list \( a \) and then calls another function `func_2(k, x, a)` to compute a product based on the sorted list. Finally, it prints the result of `func_2(k, x, a)` for each test case.
