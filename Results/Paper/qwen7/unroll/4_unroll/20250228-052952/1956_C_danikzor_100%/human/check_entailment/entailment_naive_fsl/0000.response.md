Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix as described in the problem statement. According to the problem, the goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the \(n \times n\) matrix using no more than \(2n\) operations. The program attempts to achieve this by performing two operations of type 1 and 2 for each row, setting each element in the row to the value of its position in reverse order (i.e., \(n, n-1, \ldots, 1\)).

However, this approach does not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix. For example, consider a \(2 \times 2\) matrix. The program will set the matrix as follows:
```
1 2
1 2
```
This results in a sum of \(1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6\). However, the optimal configuration for a \(2 \times 2\) matrix would be:
```
2 1
1 2
```
which gives a sum of \(2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6\), but the arrangement is different. The program's approach does not guarantee that the maximum possible sum is achieved, especially for larger matrices.

To illustrate, let's consider a \(3 \times 3\) matrix. The program will set the matrix as:
```
3 2 1
3 2 1
3 2 1
```
This results in a sum of \(3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 18\). However, the optimal configuration for a \(3 \times 3\) matrix would be:
```
3 1 2
2 3 1
1 2 3
```
which gives a sum of \(3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 18\), but again, the arrangement is different. The program's approach does not ensure the maximum sum is achieved.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases, making it incorrect.
