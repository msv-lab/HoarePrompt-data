Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \(n \times n\) matrix using at most \(2n\) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case, which calculates the maximum possible sum and the required number of operations.
   - The formula \(n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4n - 1) / 6\) is used to calculate the maximum sum, which is incorrect. The correct maximum sum for an \(n \times n\) matrix where each element is set to its position in the permutation (i.e., \(a_{i,j} = \min(i, j)\)) is \(n^2\).
   - The solution prints \(2n\) operations, each of which permutes the elements of a row or column in descending order. This approach does not necessarily achieve the maximum sum, as setting each element to its position in the permutation (i.e., \(a_{i,j} = \min(i, j)\)) would achieve the maximum sum.
3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The formula \(n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4n - 1) / 6\) is incorrect and does not represent the maximum sum achievable.
   - The operations performed (permuting rows and columns in descending order) do not achieve the maximum sum. Instead, setting each element to its position in the permutation (i.e., \(a_{i,j} = \min(i, j)\)) would achieve the maximum sum.
4. **Conclusion**:
   - The given solution does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix elements. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

However, upon closer inspection, the original assessment might have overlooked the fact that the provided solution, while incorrect in terms of the formula used, still achieves the maximum sum by permuting rows and columns in a way that sets each element to \(\min(i, j)\). Although the formula is incorrect, the operations themselves are correct in achieving the desired result.

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the use of an incorrect formula to calculate the maximum sum, but the operations themselves are correct in achieving the maximum sum.
