Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case has an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. For each test case, it processes t and n and returns a result based on these values.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing two integers t and n within specified ranges, and it processes these values according to some unspecified logic, returning a result for each test case.
