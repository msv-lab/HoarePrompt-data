Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
2. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
3. The provided program does not actually perform any permutations on the matrix as described in the problem statement. Instead, it calculates a value and prints it along with \( 2n \) operations, which do not modify the matrix.
4. The calculated value \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1) // 6 \) does not correspond to the maximum possible sum of the matrix.
5. The operations printed (both starting with `1` and `2`, followed by the same permutation) do not change the values in the matrix since they are applied to the same sequence of numbers repeatedly.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
