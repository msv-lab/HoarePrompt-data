Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` and then counts the number of zeros remaining in the list, which is not the correct approach to solving the problem.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the process of moving chips to the left until they form a single block. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the first chip
        first_chip_index = next(i for i, x in enumerate(a) if x == 1)
        
        # Count the number of operations needed
        operations = 0
        for i in range(first_chip_index + 1, n):
            if a[i] == 1:
                # Move the chip to the leftmost possible position
                moves_to_left = i - first_chip_index - 1
                operations += moves_to_left
                first_chip_index = i - moves_to_left
        
        print(operations)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program finds the first chip and then simulates moving subsequent chips to the left until all chips are in a single block. It counts the number of operations required to achieve this configuration.
