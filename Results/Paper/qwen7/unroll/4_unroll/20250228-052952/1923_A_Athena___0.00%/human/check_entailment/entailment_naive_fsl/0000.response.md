Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. The logic in the program does not account for moving chips to the closest free cell to the left. Instead, it removes leading and trailing zeros from the list and counts the number of zeros remaining, which does not reflect the actual minimum number of operations needed.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
The expected output is `1`, because moving the chip in the 7th position to the 5th position achieves the goal. However, the program will incorrectly output the length of the list after removing leading and trailing zeros, which is `6` in this case.

Another example:
```
5
9
0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
```
The expected output is `3`, but the program will output `6` because it simply counts the remaining zeros after removing leading and trailing zeros.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
