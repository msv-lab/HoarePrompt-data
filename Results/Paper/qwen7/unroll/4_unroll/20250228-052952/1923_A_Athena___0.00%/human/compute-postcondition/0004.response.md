Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n`, and a list of `n` binary values indicating whether cells contain chips. It removes any leading and trailing zeros from the list, counts the number of zeros remaining in the list, and prints both the modified list and the count. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
