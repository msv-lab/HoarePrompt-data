You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

    0

Output

    2
    2

    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of all m values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a string obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input, `b` is a string obtained from the next input, `k` is an integer representing the number of times `a[i]` matched `b[j]` before `j` reached `m` or the end of the loop, `j` is an integer representing the position in string `b` where the loop last attempted to find a match for `a[i]`.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (the number of times `a[i]` matched `b[j]` before `j` reached `m` or the end of the loop)
    return
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), followed by two binary strings \( a \) and \( b \). It then compares each character of \( a \) with \( b \) up to the length of \( b \), counting the number of matches. Finally, it prints the count of matches and returns None.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to process one test case at a time. It correctly reads the lengths `n` and `m`, and the binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Variable Initialization**: 
   - `k` is initialized to 0, which will store the length of the prefix of `a` that forms a subsequence of `b`.
   - `j` is initialized to 0, which will be used to traverse through string `b`.

3. **Loop Through String `a`**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in string `a`.
   - For each character `a[i]`, it uses a `while` loop to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in string `b`.
   - If `b[j]` matches `a[i]`, it increments both `k` and `j` to move to the next character in `a` and the next potential match in `b`.
   - If no match is found (`j >= m`), the loop breaks, indicating that the remaining part of `a` cannot form a subsequence of `b`.

4. **Output**: After processing all characters in `a`, it prints the value of `k`.

5. **Test Case Handling**: The main block of the script processes each test case using a loop that calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Analysis:

- The logic inside `func_1()` correctly implements the requirement to find the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
- The implementation handles all edge cases, including when `a` is longer than `b`, and when there are no matching subsequences.
- The code adheres to the problem constraints and correctly outputs the expected results for the provided examples.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
