Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is a string obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input, `b` is a string obtained from the next input.**

The code `b = input()` reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
