### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum prefix length `k` of string `a` that forms a subsequence of string `b`. The solution iterates through each character of `a` and checks if it appears in `b` in order.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function correctly reads the lengths `n` and `m` of strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It initializes counters `k` and `j` to 0, where `k` will store the length of the prefix of `a` that matches a subsequence of `b`, and `j` will track the current position in `b`.
   - It then iterates through each character of `a` using a for loop.
   - Inside the loop, it uses a while loop to find the corresponding character in `b` and increments `j` until it finds a match or reaches the end of `b`.
   - If a match is found, it increments `k` and continues to the next character in `a`.
   - If no match is found within the bounds of `b`, it breaks out of the loop.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `k`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles cases where the characters of `a` do not appear in `b` in order.
   - It correctly identifies when the end of `b` is reached without finding a match.
   - The logic ensures that the function outputs the maximum possible `k` for each test case.

4. **Overall Functionality**:
   - The function correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.
   - It adheres to the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement.
