Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has an issue with how it processes the test cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` is defined but never called within the main loop where the test cases are processed. This means that the program will not execute the logic inside `func_1` for any test case, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, you should call `func_1()` inside the main loop. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
    return
```

With this correction, the program will correctly process each test case and compute the desired value of `k`.
