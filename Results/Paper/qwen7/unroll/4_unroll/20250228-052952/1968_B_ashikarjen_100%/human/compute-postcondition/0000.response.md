Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, n is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input, m is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the input using `input().split()`, which splits the input into a list of strings, and then `map(int, ...)` converts these strings into integers. The values of `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
