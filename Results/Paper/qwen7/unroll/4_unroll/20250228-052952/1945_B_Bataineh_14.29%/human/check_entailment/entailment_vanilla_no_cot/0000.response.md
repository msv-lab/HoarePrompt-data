Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. The logic `m // a + m // b + 2` is incorrect because it does not account for the overlaps between the intervals where fireworks from both installations are visible. 

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the interval where both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. The formula should consider the LCM to accurately count the overlaps and then calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        # Calculate the number of fireworks from each installation
        fireworks_a = (m + a - 1) // a
        fireworks_b = (m + b - 1) // b
        # Calculate the number of simultaneous fireworks from both installations
        simultaneous_fireworks = (m + lcm_ab - 1) // lcm_ab
        # The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time
        max_visible_fireworks = fireworks_a + fireworks_b - simultaneous_fireworks
        print(max_visible_fireworks)

func()
```

This corrected function properly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time by considering the overlaps using the LCM of `a` and `b`.
