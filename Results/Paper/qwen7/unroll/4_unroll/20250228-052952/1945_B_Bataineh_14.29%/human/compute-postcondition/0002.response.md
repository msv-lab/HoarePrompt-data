Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either "2" or the result of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2`. The number of lines will be equal to the value of `t`, which was initially input by the user. Each line corresponds to one iteration of the loop, where `a`, `b`, and `m` are read from the input for that iteration.
