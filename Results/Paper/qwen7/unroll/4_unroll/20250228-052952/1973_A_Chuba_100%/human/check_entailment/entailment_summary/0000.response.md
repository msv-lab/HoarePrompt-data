Reasoning:
1. The program correctly identifies if the sum of the scores \(p_1 + p_2 + p_3\) is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints \(-1\), which is correct because an odd sum cannot be achieved through the scoring rules (each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points distributed between two players).
2. For even sums, the program attempts to calculate the maximum number of draws. However, the formula used in the program is incorrect. Specifically, the expression `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` does not accurately represent the maximum number of draws. 
3. The correct approach to find the maximum number of draws involves calculating the total number of games played and then determining how many of those games could have resulted in draws. This requires a more detailed analysis of the scores and the possible game outcomes.

Given the above reasoning, the program is not correct because it uses an incorrect formula to calculate the maximum number of draws.

Correctness: **False**
