Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed based on the input provided for each iteration of the loop. For each input triplet (v[0], v[1], v[2]), if the sum of the triplet is odd, "-1" will be printed; otherwise, the result calculated as \((v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2\) will be printed. This process will repeat for `t` iterations, where `t` is the initial value of the input integer.
