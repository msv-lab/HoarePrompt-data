### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to determine its correctness, focusing on the edge cases and the overall logic.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Parity:**
   - The program checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even using `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1`.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points to the winning player or 2 points in total if it's a draw).

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws.
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
     \]

#### Detailed Explanation of the Formula

- **Total Points Calculation:**
  - The total points scored by all players is `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`.
  - Each game can contribute up to 2 points (if there is a winner) or 2 points (if it's a draw).

- **Adjustment for Minimum Possible Points:**
  - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that we do not subtract more than the minimum points that `p3` should have to be consistent with `p1` and `p2`.
  - If `v[2] - v[0] - v[1]` is negative, it means `p3` already has more points than what `p1` and `p2` can give, so we do not subtract anything.

- **Dividing by 2:**
  - Since each draw contributes 2 points in total, we divide the adjusted total points by 2 to get the number of draws.

#### Edge Cases

1. **All Zeros:**
   - For `0 0 0`, the sum is even, and the result is correctly calculated as 0.

2. **Single Draw:**
   - For `0 1 1`, the sum is even, and the result is correctly calculated as 1.

3. **Invalid Case:**
   - For `1 1 2`, the sum is even, but the result is incorrectly calculated as 2. The correct answer should be 1 because the only way to achieve these scores is with one draw between the first and second player, and one win for the third player.

4. **Another Invalid Case:**
   - For `1 1 10`, the sum is even, but the result is incorrectly calculated as 2. The correct answer should be 2 because the only way to achieve these scores is with two draws between the first and second players, and one win for the third player.

#### Correct Logic

To correctly calculate the maximum number of draws, we need to ensure that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game. Here is a corrected approach:

1. **Check Parity:**
   - Ensure the sum of the scores is even.

2. **Calculate Maximum Draws:**
   - Use the formula to calculate the maximum number of draws, ensuring that the scores are consistent with the rules.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 != 0:
            print('-1')
        else:
            # Calculate the maximum number of draws
            max_draws = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(v[2] - v[0] - v[1], 0)) // 2
            
            # Check if the calculated draws are consistent with the scores
            if max_draws * 2 <= v[2] - v[0] - v[1]:
                print(max_draws)
            else:
                print('-1')

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program had issues with calculating the maximum number of draws correctly. The corrected program ensures that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game and handles edge cases properly.
