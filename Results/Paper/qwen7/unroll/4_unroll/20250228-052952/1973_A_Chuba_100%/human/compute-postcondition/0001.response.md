State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 to 500, and t must be at least 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` requires that `t` is a non-negative integer.
2. The loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1 (since `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`, meaning the loop will run `t` times).
3. Given that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 500, we need to ensure that `t` is indeed a valid integer in this range and is at least 1 to guarantee the loop's execution.

Therefore, the state must be adjusted to reflect that `t` must be an integer within the specified range and must be at least 1.
