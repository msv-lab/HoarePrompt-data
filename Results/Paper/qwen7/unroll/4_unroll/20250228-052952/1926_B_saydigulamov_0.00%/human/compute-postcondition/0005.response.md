Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid represented as a list of strings containing '0's and '1's. For each test case, it counts the number of '1's in the first two strings provided. If these counts are equal, it prints the counts. If no such pair of strings has equal counts, nothing is printed.**
