Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program checks only the first two rows for the count of '1's and prints the count if they are equal. However, this approach is insufficient because:

1. The program does not check if the entire grid forms a triangle or a square.
2. The program does not handle the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square.
3. The program does not consider the possibility of multiple rows forming the pattern of a triangle or a square.

Given these issues, the program will likely produce incorrect results for most test cases. Therefore, the provided program is not correct for solving the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
