### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and verify the corrected implementation:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Shapes:**
   - The original program only checks if the first two elements of `k` are equal, which is insufficient for identifying either a square or a triangle. For a square, all rows must have the same number of '1's, and for a triangle, the counts must follow the pattern \(1, 3, 5, \ldots\).

2. **No Handling for Triangles:**
   - The original program does not handle the case where the grid forms a triangle. It only checks for squares.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The original program prints the list of counts instead of the required shape names ("SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE").

The corrected implementation addresses these issues:
- It checks if the counts of '1's in each row match the pattern of a square or a triangle.
- It prints the appropriate shape name ("SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE").
- It handles both squares and triangles correctly.

Given the corrected implementation, the program now accurately identifies the shapes based on the provided problem description and the function summary.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The corrected program is now correct according to the problem description and the function summary.
