You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid represented as a list of strings containing '0's and '1's. For each test case, it counts the number of '1's in the first two strings provided. If these counts are equal, it prints the counts. If no such pair of strings has equal counts, nothing is printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly identifies whether the given grid contains a square or a triangle.

### Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines of input.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - For each test case, it stores the count of '1's in each row in the list `k`.
   - If there is at least one '1' in a row, the program counts the number of '1's in that row.
   - After processing all rows, it checks if the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`.

3. **Output:**
   - If the condition `k[0] == k[1]` is met, the program prints `k`, which is a list of counts of '1's in each row.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Shapes:**
   - The program only checks if the first two elements of `k` are equal, which does not guarantee that the entire grid forms a square or a triangle.
   - For a square, the counts of '1's should be equal across all rows, but the program only checks the first two rows.
   - For a triangle, the counts of '1's should follow a specific pattern (e.g., 1, 3, 5, ...), but the program does not check this pattern.

2. **No Handling for Triangles:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the grid forms a triangle. It only checks for squares.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints `k` instead of printing "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly identify the shapes, we need to:
1. Check if the counts of '1's in each row match the pattern of a square or a triangle.
2. Print the appropriate shape name ("SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE").

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        k = []
        for _ in range(n):
            b = input().strip()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        # Check for square
        if len(set(k)) == 1 and min(k) > 1:
            print("SQUARE")
        # Check for triangle
        elif all(k[i] == 2 * i + 1 for i in range(len(k))):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        else:
            print("NEITHER")

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect because it does not properly identify the shapes and does not handle the logic for both squares and triangles correctly. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
