Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a grid represented as a list of n strings, where each string contains n characters ('0' or '1'), and determines whether the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's. Based on this determination, it returns either "triangle" or "square". If the grid does not meet the criteria, it returns an appropriate message indicating the issue.**
