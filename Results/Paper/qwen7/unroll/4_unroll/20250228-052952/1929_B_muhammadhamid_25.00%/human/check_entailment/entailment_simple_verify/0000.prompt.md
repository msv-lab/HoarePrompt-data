You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

        if k == 1:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either `1`, `math.ceil(k / 2)`, or `k // 2 + 1`. The specific value on each line depends on the values of `n` and `k` provided for each test case within the range specified. For each test case, if `k` equals 1, the output will be `1`. If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, the output will be `math.ceil(k / 2)`. Otherwise, the output will be `k // 2 + 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to account for the requirement that at least \(k\) diagonals must have at least one colored cell. Let's analyze a specific case to illustrate this:

For the test case \(n = 3\) and \(k = 10\), the program should output 6 because we need to color 6 cells to ensure that all 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell. However, the current implementation does not guarantee this. 

The program logic is as follows:
- If \(k == 1\), it prints 1.
- If \(k \leq 2n\), it prints \(\lceil k / 2 \rceil\).
- Otherwise, it prints \(k // 2 + 1\).

This logic does not always ensure that the minimum number of cells required to satisfy the condition is printed. For instance, in the case of \(n = 3\) and \(k = 10\), the program will print 5 instead of 6, which is incorrect.

To fix this, a more detailed approach is needed to ensure that the minimum number of cells required to meet the condition is calculated accurately. This would involve a more complex algorithm to determine the exact number of cells needed based on the value of \(k\) relative to the total number of diagonals.
