Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: t (a positive integer between 1 and 10^4), n and k (integers where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), P_B and P_S (integers within the range specified), and p (a permutation of length n) and a (an array of n positive integers). It does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information.**

This means the function `func` takes in a positive integer `t`, two integers `n` and `k` with specific constraints, two more integers `P_B` and `P_S`, a permutation list `p` of length `n`, and an array `a` of `n` positive integers. The function does not return any value based on the provided output cases.
