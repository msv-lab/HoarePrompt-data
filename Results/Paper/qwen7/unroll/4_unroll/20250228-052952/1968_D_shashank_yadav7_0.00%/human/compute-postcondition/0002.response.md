Output State: The output state depends on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop. For each input set, the loop calculates whether 'Bodya' or 'Sasha' has a higher score based on the given conditions and prints the result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw'). After all iterations, the final printed result for each input set will be part of the output state.
