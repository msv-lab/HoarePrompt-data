Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the necessary parameters and initializes the starting positions for Bodya and Sasha.
3. It then iteratively calculates the scores for both players over `k` turns, considering their possible moves and the associated scores.
4. The logic for updating the scores and positions is implemented correctly, ensuring that both players' scores are updated based on their current positions and the maximum possible score they could achieve by moving to their next position in the permutation.
5. Finally, it compares the total scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') for each test case.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the implementation seems to follow the rules and logic specified. There are no apparent errors or logical flaws in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
