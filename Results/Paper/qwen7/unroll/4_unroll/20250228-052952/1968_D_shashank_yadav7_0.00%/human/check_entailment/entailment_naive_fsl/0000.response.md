Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for updating the scores and positions of Bodya and Sasha is flawed. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Score Calculation**: The program incorrectly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. It uses `bm` and `sm` to store the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively, but it does not correctly update these values during each turn. The current implementation only updates the scores once per turn, which is insufficient.

2. **Position Update**: The program updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha correctly using the permutation array `p`, but it does not handle the scenario where a player might stay at their current position instead of moving to `p[x]`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  4 2 3 2
  4 1 2 3
  7 2 5 6
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  - Bodya starts at position 3.
  - Sasha starts at position 2.
  - After the first turn:
    - Bodya's score: \(a_3 + a_{p_3} = 5 + 2 = 7\).
    - Sasha's score: \(a_2 + a_{p_2} = 2 + 5 = 7\).
  - After the second turn:
    - Bodya's score: \(7 + a_3 = 7 + 5 = 12\).
    - Sasha's score: \(7 + a_2 = 7 + 2 = 9\).

- **Actual Output**:
  - The program incorrectly calculates the scores and does not handle the possibility of staying at the current position.

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly simulate the game for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
