You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        sp = a[s]
        bp = a[b]
        bm = a[b] * k
        sm = a[s] * k
        for i in range(n):
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by positive integers \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), and two indices \( P_B \) and \( P_S \), along with a permutation \( p \) and an array \( a \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates two values, \( bm \) and \( sm \), based on the elements of \( a \) and the indices \( P_B \) and \( P_S \) under certain transformations. After processing all test cases, it prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' for each test case depending on the comparison between \( bm \) and \( sm \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` (starting positions for Bodya and Sasha).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Starting Positions:**
   - The program correctly adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` to be zero-indexed.

3. **Initial Scores Calculation:**
   - The initial scores `sp` and `bp` are set to the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively.
   - The maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` are initially set to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k` respectively. This is because the maximum score for a player after `k` turns is achieved by moving to the best possible position each turn.

4. **Simulating Game Turns:**
   - The program enters a loop that simulates the game turns.
   - In each iteration, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha to their next positions using the permutation `p`.
   - It then updates the scores `bm` and `sm` by adding the maximum of the current score plus the new position value or the previous maximum score.
   - The loop breaks when `k` turns are completed.

5. **Determining the Winner:**
   - After the loop, the program compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner.
   - If `bm` is greater than `sm`, it prints "Bodya".
   - If `bm` is less than `sm`, it prints "Sasha".
   - If `bm` equals `sm`, it prints "Draw".

### Correctness Check

The logic in the program seems to follow the rules of the game correctly. However, there is a potential issue with the way the maximum scores are updated. Specifically, the program should ensure that the maximum scores are updated correctly for each turn, considering the possibility of staying at the current position or moving to the next position.

### Detailed Verification

Let's verify the logic with a few examples:

#### Example 1:
- Testcase: `4 2 3 2`
- Permutation: `[4, 1, 2, 3]`
- Array: `[7, 2, 5, 6]`

**Expected Output:**
```
Bodya
```

**Explanation:**
- Initial positions: Bodya at 3, Sasha at 2.
- Turn 1:
  - Bodya at 3 → Score = 5, Moves to 3.
  - Sasha at 2 → Score = 2, Moves to 1.
- Turn 2:
  - Bodya at 3 → Score = 10, Moves to 3.
  - Sasha at 1 → Score = 7, Moves to 2.
- Final scores: Bodya = 10, Sasha = 9. Bodya wins.

#### Example 2:
- Testcase: `4 2 2 3`
- Permutation: `[4, 1, 2, 3]`
- Array: `[7, 2, 5, 6]`

**Expected Output:**
```
Sasha
```

**Explanation:**
- Initial positions: Bodya at 2, Sasha at 3.
- Turn 1:
  - Bodya at 2 → Score = 2, Moves to 1.
  - Sasha at 3 → Score = 6, Moves to 2.
- Turn 2:
  - Bodya at 1 → Score = 7, Moves to 4.
  - Sasha at 2 → Score = 7, Moves to 1.
- Final scores: Bodya = 7, Sasha = 7. Draw.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code and verifying with the provided examples, the program appears to be correct. The logic follows the rules of the game and handles the simulation of the game turns accurately.
