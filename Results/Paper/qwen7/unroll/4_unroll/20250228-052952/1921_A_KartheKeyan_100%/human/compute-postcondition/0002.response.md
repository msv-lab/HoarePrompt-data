Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `while n:`. The only variable here is `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `n` must be true (non-zero).

3. **Current State Before the Loop:**
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is calculated as `(n // 4) + (n - (4 * (n // 4))) // 2` and printed for each iteration of the while loop.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   Since the loop condition depends solely on `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is non-zero for the loop to execute at least once.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`. It must be non-zero for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be non-zero**
