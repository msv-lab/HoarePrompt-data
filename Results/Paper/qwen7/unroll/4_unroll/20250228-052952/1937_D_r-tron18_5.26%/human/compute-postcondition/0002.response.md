Output State: **`preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all elements in `pre` up to that index, including 0 as the initial element; `pre` is a list of integers where each integer is (i + 1) for every index `i` where `s1[i]` is '>'; `s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s1`; `t` is the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5 and for each test case 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^5; `totalOne` is the length of the list `pre`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `preOne` using the `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module, which generates a running total of the elements in the list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0. This means that each element in `preOne` is the sum of all elements in `pre` up to that index, including the initial 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
