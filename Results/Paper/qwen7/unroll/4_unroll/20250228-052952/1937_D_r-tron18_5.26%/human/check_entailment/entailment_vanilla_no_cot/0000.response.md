Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution seems to have several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is not correctly implemented and its logic doesn't align with the requirements of the problem. It uses variables `n` and `times` which are not defined in the context of the function, leading to potential errors.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` attempts to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. However, the logic inside the function is overly complex and does not correctly simulate the pinball movement.
   - The use of `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, and `suffZero` arrays is not clearly explained and does not seem to follow the expected behavior of the pinball movement.
   - The conditions and calculations inside the loop do not accurately reflect the movement and inversion rules of the pinball.

3. **Missing Simulation of Pinball Movement**: The solution does not properly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the given rules. Instead, it tries to calculate the time using some derived formulas which are not correctly implemented.

4. **Output Format**: The solution prints the results directly without returning them as required by the problem statement. The output should be formatted as specified in the example.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to simulate the movement of the pinball for each starting position and keep track of the time taken until it leaves the grid. This involves iterating through the grid and updating the positions and directions of the pinball accordingly.
