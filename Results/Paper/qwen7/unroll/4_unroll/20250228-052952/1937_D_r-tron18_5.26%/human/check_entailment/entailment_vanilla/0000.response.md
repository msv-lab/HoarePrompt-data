Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid with `n` cells.
   - Each cell contains either `<` or `>`.
   - A pinball starts at a specific cell and moves according to the direction of the cell it is currently on.
   - The direction of the cell is toggled after each move.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

2. **Code Structure:**
   - The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is not directly relevant to solving the main problem but seems to be part of a larger logic.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes the input and calculates the time for each pinball starting position.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `pre` is a list of indices where the direction is `>` (right).
     - `totalOne` counts the number of `>` directions.
     - `preOne` is a cumulative sum of the positions of `>` directions.
     - `suffZero` is a list to store suffix sums of positions where the direction is `<` (left).
     - `ans` is initialized to store the result for each starting position.

   - **Main Logic:**
     - The loop iterates backward through the string `s1` (from the last cell to the first).
     - For each cell, it checks the direction (`el`).
     - Depending on the direction, it calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using different formulas.
     - It updates the `preOne` and `suffZero` lists accordingly.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_2` appears to correctly handle the toggling of directions and the calculation of the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The use of cumulative sums and suffix sums helps in efficiently calculating the required values.
   - The backward iteration ensures that the pinball's path is correctly traced.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided code seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions and their logic align with the problem statement and the expected behavior of the pinball.

**Correctness: **True**
