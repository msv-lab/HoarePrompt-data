Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities.
2. The program attempts to solve this by precomputing distances and using prefix sums.
3. `func_1` is supposed to generate a list where each element represents the cost to move to the closest city from the current city. However, there are issues with how `func_1` is implemented:
   - It incorrectly sets the first element of `prog_cities` to 1 without considering the actual closest city.
   - It does not correctly handle the case when the closest city is the next city in the list.
4. The main part of the program uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate the minimum cost for each query. This part seems correct given the proper `prog_cities` list.
5. Based on the execution summary, the logic in `func_1` does not accurately represent the closest city distances as required by the problem.

Given these points, the implementation of `func_1` is incorrect, leading to wrong results for the queries.

Correctness: **False**
