Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line. The cost of traveling depends on whether you choose to move directly to another city or to the closest city first.

2. **Key Components of the Solution**:
   - `func_1` is supposed to compute an array where each element represents the cost to move to the next closest city.
   - `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` are computed using `func_1`.
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are prefix sums of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`, respectively.
   - Queries are processed using these prefix sums to find the minimum cost.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly identifies the closest city for each city by comparing distances to the previous and next city.
   - It returns an array where each element is either 1 (indicating moving to the next closest city) or the distance to the next city.

4. **Processing Queries**:
   - The solution uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate the cost of moving from one city to another.
   - If the destination city index is greater than the source city index, it uses `pref_sum_f`. Otherwise, it uses `pref_sum_b`.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The code assumes that the closest city is always unique, which is stated in the problem constraints.
   - The logic for determining the closest city seems correct based on the problem statement.
   - The use of prefix sums is appropriate for efficient query processing.

6. **Verification**:
   - The provided example in the problem statement is correctly handled by the code.
   - The constraints and additional constraints are respected.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
