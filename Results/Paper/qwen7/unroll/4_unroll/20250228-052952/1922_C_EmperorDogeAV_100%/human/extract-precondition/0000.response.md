Precondition: **cities is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line in strictly increasing order (i.e., 0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and the function also receives a list of m queries, where each query is a pair of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the indices of two cities for which the minimum number of coins needed to travel from city x_i to city y_i must be calculated (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n, x_i != y_i, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5).**
