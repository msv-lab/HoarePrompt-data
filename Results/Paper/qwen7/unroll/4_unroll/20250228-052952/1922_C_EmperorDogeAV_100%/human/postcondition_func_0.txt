The function `func_1` takes a list of city coordinates `cities` and generates a new list `prog_cities` of length `n-1`. Each element in `prog_cities` is either 1 or the absolute difference between the coordinate of the city at position `i+1` and the city at position `i` in the `cities` list. Specifically, the first element is 1 if the second city is closer than the first city; otherwise, it is the absolute difference between the first and second city. Each subsequent element in `prog_cities` is determined by comparing the current city with the next city in the `cities` list.
