Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `cities`, which is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line in strictly increasing order. It also returns a list `prog_cities` of length n-1. Each element in `prog_cities` is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at position i+1 and the city at position i in the list `cities`. The first element is 1 if the second city is closer than the first city, otherwise it is the absolute difference between the first and second city. Each subsequent element follows the same rule comparing the current city with the next city.**
