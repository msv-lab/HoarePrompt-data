Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities on a number line, considering the unique closest city rule.
2. The annotated program correctly implements the logic to find the closest city for each city and then uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate the minimum cost for each query.
3. The `func_1` function correctly identifies the closest city for each city by comparing the distances to the previous and next city.
4. The main part of the program calculates the prefix sums for both forward and backward directions and uses these sums to answer the queries efficiently.
5. The logic for handling queries is correct, using the prefix sums to determine the minimum cost based on whether the destination city is before or after the starting city.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
