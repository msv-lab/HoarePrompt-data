You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line in strictly increasing order (i.e., 0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and the function also receives a list of m queries, where each query is a pair of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the indices of two cities for which the minimum number of coins needed to travel from city x_i to city y_i must be calculated (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n, x_i != y_i, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5).
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line in strictly increasing order, and `prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at position i+1 and the city at position i. If the next city is closer than the previous city, the corresponding element in `prog_cities` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference between the next and current city.
    return prog_cities
    #`prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at position i+1 and the city at position i in the list `cities`. The first element is 1 if the second city is closer than the first city, otherwise it is the absolute difference between the first and second city. Each subsequent element follows the same rule comparing the current city with the next city.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `cities`, which is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line in strictly increasing order. It also returns a list `prog_cities` of length n-1. Each element in `prog_cities` is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at position i+1 and the city at position i in the list `cities`. The first element is 1 if the second city is closer than the first city, otherwise it is the absolute difference between the first and second city. Each subsequent element follows the same rule comparing the current city with the next city.

```

Return Postconditions: `prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at position i+1 and the city at position i in the list `cities`. The first element is 1 if the second city is closer than the first city, otherwise it is the absolute difference between the first and second city. Each subsequent element follows the same rule comparing the current city with the next city.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
