Output State: **`prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at position i+1 and the city at position i in the list `cities`. The first element is 1 if the second city is closer than the first city, otherwise it is the absolute difference between the first and second city. Each subsequent element follows the same rule comparing the current city with the next city.**

This means that `prog_cities` will contain elements that are either 1 (if the next city is closer) or the actual distance between consecutive cities in the `cities` list.
