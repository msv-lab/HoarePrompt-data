Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 in the `range(n)` function.
   - `n` is given as a positive integer.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 (since `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and if `n` is 0, the range will be empty).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider the other given variables**:
   - `pos` is -1, but this variable is not used in the loop head, so no adjustment is needed for `pos`.
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), but this information is not directly relevant to the loop head.
   - `arr` is the return value of `func_2()`, but this variable is not used in the loop head, so no adjustment is needed for `arr`.

Based on the above analysis, the only adjustments needed are for the variables `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
