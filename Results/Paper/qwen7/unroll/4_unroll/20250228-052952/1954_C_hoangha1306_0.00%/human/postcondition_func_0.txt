The function processes multiple pairs of integer strings (x and y) of the same length. For each pair, it generates two new strings (kq1 and kq2) where, for each character position, if the characters are the same, they are copied directly; otherwise, the smaller digit is placed in kq1 and the larger digit in kq2. After processing all pairs, it prints kq1 and kq2 for each pair.
