Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns whether two strings representing integers of the same length (x and y) are equal.**

Given that the parameters `x` and `y` are not actually passed to the function as defined, the function should compare two strings representing integers of the same length and return a boolean value indicating whether they are equal. However, since the function definition does not include any parameters, the description focuses on the expected behavior based on the provided constraints.
