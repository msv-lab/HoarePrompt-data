Output State: **The output is the smallest missing integer in the array `arr` for each test case. If there are no duplicates and the array is complete (i.e., it contains all integers from 0 to n-1), then the output is n. If the smallest missing integer is found before completing the loop, that integer is printed.**

This output state describes the result of running the given loop for each test case, where the loop prints the smallest missing integer in the input array `arr`.
