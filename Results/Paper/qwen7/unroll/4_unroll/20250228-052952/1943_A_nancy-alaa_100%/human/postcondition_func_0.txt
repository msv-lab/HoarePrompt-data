For each test case, the function reads a positive integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` non-negative integers. It then finds and prints the smallest missing integer in the list `arr`. If there are no duplicates and the list contains all integers from 0 to n-1, it prints `n`. If the smallest missing integer is found during the iteration, it is printed immediately.
