Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described in the problem statement. The program simply finds the smallest missing integer in the list `arr` without considering the turns of Alice and Bob or their strategic choices to maximize or minimize the MEX of the array `c`.

According to the problem, Alice and Bob take turns to modify the arrays `a` and `c`, and the goal is to determine the optimal MEX value at the end of the game. However, the provided code does not account for these dynamics. Instead, it only checks for the presence of integers in the array `arr` and prints the smallest missing integer, which is not the same as the MEX of the array `c` formed through the game process.

Therefore, the given program does not solve the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
