Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in Python to indicate that the value is not needed. It is typically used for iterating over the range of input values.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as there are more test cases to process. The number of test cases is determined by the input, which is read using `int(input())`.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state given is:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of \(n\) non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i < n\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop is driven by the input from `int(input())`, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is the one that represents the number of iterations, which is derived from the input.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input itself, specifically the number of test cases.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, and the input must provide at least one test case**.

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once, as required.
