Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing a game on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice picks elements from `a` and appends them to her array `c`, while Bob only removes elements from `a`. The goal is to determine the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of `c` at the end of the game, assuming both players play optimally.

2. **Game Dynamics**:
   - Alice can strategically pick elements to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob will try to minimize the MEX by picking elements that could potentially reduce the MEX value.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should aim to create gaps in the sequence of numbers in `c` to increase the MEX.
   - Bob should try to fill these gaps by picking the smallest available numbers.

4. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - To find the MEX, we need to identify the smallest integer that is not in the array `arr`.

5. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code attempts to find the smallest missing integer in the array `arr` using a counter (`mpp`) to count occurrences of each integer.
   - The logic inside the loop checks for the smallest integer that is not in `arr` or has been picked by Alice (indicated by `first` being `True`).

6. **Issues with the Given Code**:
   - The code does not correctly simulate the game dynamics where Alice and Bob take turns.
   - The code assumes that the smallest missing integer is the MEX without considering the optimal moves of both players.
   - The code does not handle the alternating turns between Alice and Bob.

7. **Correct Approach**:
   - Alice should pick the smallest available number to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should pick the smallest available number to minimize the MEX.
   - The MEX can be determined by finding the smallest integer that is not present in the array after both players have made their optimal moves.

Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly simulate the game or compute the MEX based on optimal play. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
