Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program does not accurately calculate the maximum score based on the rules given. Specifically, the program attempts to balance the counts of each card type to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`, but it does not fully account for the dynamic nature of the problem and the ability to buy additional cards to achieve this goal.

The solution needs to consider more complex scenarios, such as strategically buying additional cards to fill gaps and ensure that the maximum number of valid subarrays can be formed. The current implementation does not handle these aspects correctly.
