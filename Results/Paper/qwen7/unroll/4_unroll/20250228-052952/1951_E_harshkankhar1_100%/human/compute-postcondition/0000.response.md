Output State: **s is an input string, n is the length of the input string s**.

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The variable `n`, which was initially the length of the string `s`, is no longer directly accessible or updated by this code. Therefore, `n` remains as the length of the input string `s`.
