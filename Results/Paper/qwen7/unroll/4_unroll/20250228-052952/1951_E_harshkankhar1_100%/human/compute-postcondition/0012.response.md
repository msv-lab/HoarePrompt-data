Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is an input string.
- `n` is the integer value calculated from `len(s)`, which means `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `x` is `-1`.
- `func_1(s)` returns `True`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` without any dependence on the variables `s`, `n`, `x`, or the result of `func_1(s)`.

Output: **NO**
