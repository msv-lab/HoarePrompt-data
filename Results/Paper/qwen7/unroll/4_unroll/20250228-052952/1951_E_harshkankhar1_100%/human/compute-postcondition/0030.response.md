Functionality: **The function processes an input string `s` and checks certain conditions related to the string. It does not return any value. Depending on the conditions met, it prints one of two messages ('YES' or 'NO') along with some indices or substrings of the input string. The function also calls another function `func_1` which is not detailed here but assumed to return a boolean value.**
