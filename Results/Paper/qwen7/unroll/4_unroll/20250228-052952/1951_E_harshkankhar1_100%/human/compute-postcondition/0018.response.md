Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `n` is the integer value calculated from `len(s)`, meaning `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character of the string.
   - `func_1(s)` returns `True`, indicating that the entire string `s` satisfies the condition specified by `func_1`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
   ```

Given these details, let's analyze what will be printed:

- Since `func_1(s)` returns `True`, it means that the entire string `s` satisfies the condition specified by `func_1`.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character. This implies that the first character of `s` is repeated until the first position where a different character appears.
- Therefore, the substring `s[:x + 1]` will include the first character of `s` and all characters up to and including the first differing character.
- The substring `s[x + 1:]` will include all characters after the first differing character.

Since `s` starts with a repeating character and then changes, `s[:x + 1]` will be the prefix of `s` up to the first differing character, and `s[x + 1:]` will be the rest of the string starting from the first differing character.

Thus, the print statement will output the prefix up to the first differing character followed by a space and the rest of the string starting from the first differing character.

Output: **s[:x + 1] s[x + 1:]**
