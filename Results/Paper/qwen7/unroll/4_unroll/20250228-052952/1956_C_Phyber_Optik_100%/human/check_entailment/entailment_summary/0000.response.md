Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using up to \( 2n \) operations.
2. The operations allowed are either permuting the elements of a row or a column.
3. The provided code does not actually perform any of the required operations to maximize the sum of the matrix. Instead, it calculates a sum based on \( n \) using a formula and prints it along with \( 2n \).
4. The printed permutations do not correspond to any meaningful operation that would change the values in the matrix to maximize its sum.
5. The formula used to calculate the sum \( \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i \) simplifies to \( \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i \), which is not related to the problem's requirements.
6. The printed permutations are simply ranges from 1 to \( n \) repeated in both rows and columns, which does not reflect any meaningful permutation of the matrix elements to maximize the sum.

Given these observations, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
