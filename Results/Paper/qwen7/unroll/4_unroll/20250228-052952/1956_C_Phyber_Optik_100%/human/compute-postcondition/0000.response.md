Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, the value of `t` is updated to the input integer, while the precondition for `t` remains valid (it is still within the range 1 to 500). The variable `n` is not defined or assigned a value in this code snippet, so its initial state (not defined) remains unchanged. However, since the problem statement mentions that for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, this precondition is noted but not explicitly updated in the output state.
