Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. The program attempts to calculate a sum using a formula and prints `n + n` operations, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

According to the problem description, Nene needs to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using up to \( 2n \) operations, where each operation involves either permuting rows or columns. The program instead calculates a sum using a formula that does not relate to the problem's objective of maximizing the matrix sum through permutations.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following example:

- For \( n = 2 \):
  - The initial matrix is:
    ```
    0 0
    0 0
    ```
  - The program outputs:
    ```
    7 4
    1 2 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 2 1 2
    2 2 1 2
    ```

However, the correct approach would involve permuting the rows and columns to fill the matrix with the highest possible values. For \( n = 2 \), the optimal solution would be:
- Permute the first row to `[1, 2]`.
- Permute the second row to `[2, 1]`.

This results in the matrix:
```
1 2
2 1
```
The sum of this matrix is \( 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 \), which is higher than the sum calculated by the program (7).

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
