### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates a sum and prints \( n + n \) (or \( 2n \)) operations.
   - The operations are defined as setting each element \( a_{i, j} \) to a specific value using permutations.

3. **Checking the Calculation:**
   - The sum calculation in the given solution is incorrect. The formula \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i \) does not relate to the problem's requirements.
   - Instead, we need to maximize the sum by filling the matrix such that each element \( a_{i, j} \) is set to \( i + j - 1 \).

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To maximize the sum, we can fill the matrix such that each element \( a_{i, j} \) is set to \( i + j - 1 \).
   - This can be achieved by performing \( n \) row operations and \( n \) column operations.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - For each row \( i \), perform a row operation to set \( a_{i, j} = i + j - 1 \).
   - For each column \( j \), perform a column operation to set \( a_{i, j} = i + j - 1 \).

6. **Evaluating the Given Code:**
   - The code incorrectly calculates the sum and does not correctly implement the required operations.
   - The operations printed do not correspond to the correct values needed to maximize the sum.

7. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code shows that the program initializes `sum` to 1 and then incorrectly calculates a sum using a nested loop.
   - The operations printed are of the form:
     - `1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1)` which sets the entire row to a permutation.
     - `2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1)` which sets the entire column to a permutation.
   - These operations do not achieve the goal of maximizing the sum as they simply repeat the same permutation for each row and column.

### Conclusion:

The given solution is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and does not perform the necessary operations to achieve the maximum sum. The provided operations do not align with the requirement to maximize the sum of the matrix elements.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
