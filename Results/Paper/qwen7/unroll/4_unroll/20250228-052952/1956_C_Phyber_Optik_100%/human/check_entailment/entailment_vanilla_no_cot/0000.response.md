Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Sum**: The program calculates the sum using a formula that does not relate to the operations allowed in the problem. Specifically, the sum `sum` is calculated as:
   ```python
   sum = 1
   for i in range(2, n + 1):
       sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
   ```
   This formula does not reflect the operations that can be performed to maximize the sum of the matrix. The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the \(n \times n\) matrix by performing up to \(2n\) operations of two types (row-wise and column-wise permutations).

2. **Incorrect Number of Operations**: The program prints `n + n` operations, which is not necessarily the optimal number of operations required to achieve the maximum sum. The problem specifies that the solution should use no more than \(2n\) operations, but the program does not ensure that the operations are optimal or even correct.

3. **Incorrect Operation Descriptions**: The program prints the same permutation for both row and column operations, which does not align with the problem statement where different permutations can be used for different rows and columns. Additionally, the operations do not reflect the actual permutations needed to maximize the sum of the matrix.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to strategically apply the allowed operations to fill the matrix with the highest possible values. The provided solution does not achieve this and thus is incorrect.
