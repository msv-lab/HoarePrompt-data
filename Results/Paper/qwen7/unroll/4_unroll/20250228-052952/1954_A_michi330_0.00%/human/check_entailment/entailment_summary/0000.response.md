Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking two conditions to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Let's analyze these conditions:

1. The first condition `n <= k` checks if Bob can repaint all parts of the ribbon. If this is true, then Bob can always make all parts have the same color, so Alice cannot achieve her goal. Therefore, the program correctly prints 'NO'.

2. The second condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` checks if Bob can still make all parts have the same color after Alice paints the ribbon. This condition is derived from the idea that if the number of distinct colors used by Alice is more than what Bob can repaint, then Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Specifically, `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of distinct colors needed to ensure that even if Bob repaints up to `k` parts, not all parts can be made the same color.

However, the program prints 'Yes' when this condition is true, which is incorrect. The correct logic should be to print 'NO' if this condition is true because it means Bob can still make all parts have the same color.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it prints 'Yes' instead of 'No' when the second condition is true.

Correctness: **False**
