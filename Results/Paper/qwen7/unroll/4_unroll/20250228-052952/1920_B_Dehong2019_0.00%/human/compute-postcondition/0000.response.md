Output State: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n, and there is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**

The given code is just a comment block and does not affect any variables or perform any operations. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
