The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (number of piles), and a list of \( n \) integers representing the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it determines whether Alice or Bob wins based on the distribution of stones in the piles. Specifically, it sorts the unique stone counts and checks if there is any gap greater than 1 between consecutive unique stone counts. If such a gap exists, it prints "Alice". Otherwise, it toggles a boolean value `ans` based on the presence of gaps and finally prints "Alice" if `ans` is true, otherwise "Bob".
