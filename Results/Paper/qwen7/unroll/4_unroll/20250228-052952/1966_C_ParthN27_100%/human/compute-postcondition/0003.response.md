Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns information about the distribution of stones across the piles.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a specific number of test cases (t), the number of piles (n), and the number of stones in each pile (a_i). The function processes these inputs and returns information based on the distribution of stones across the piles for each test case.
