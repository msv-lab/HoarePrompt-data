Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling**:
   - `func_1()` reads a line from standard input and returns it stripped of trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()` calls `func_1()` and returns an integer value.
   - `func_3()` calls `func_1()`, splits the result into a list of integers.
   - These functions correctly handle the input for each test case.

2. **Main Logic in `func_4()`**:
   - The function initializes the set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - It iterates `m` times, each time reading a throw distance `r` and direction `c`.
   - Depending on the direction (`c`), it calculates the new possible positions for the ball.
   - If `c` is `'?'`, both clockwise and counterclockwise possibilities are considered.
   - After processing all throws, it ensures that `0` is replaced by `n` if `0` is in the set `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the number of possible positions and the positions themselves.

3. **Edge Cases and Correctness**:
   - The logic correctly handles the case where the direction is unknown (`'?'`) by considering both possible directions.
   - The modulo operation `% n` ensures that the positions wrap around correctly within the circle of players.
   - The final check for `0` being replaced by `n` ensures that the logic correctly handles the circular nature of the problem.

Given the provided code and the problem statement, the logic implemented in `func_4()` matches the requirements and correctly computes the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws.

Correctness: **True**
