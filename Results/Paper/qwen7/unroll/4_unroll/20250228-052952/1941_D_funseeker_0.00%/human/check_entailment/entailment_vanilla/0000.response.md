Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves tracking the position of a ball thrown among `n` players in a circle. The ball can be thrown a certain distance either clockwise or counterclockwise, and we need to determine the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws.

2. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()`: Converts the result of `func_1()` to an integer.
   - `func_3()`: Converts the result of `func_1()` to a list of integers.
   - `func_4()`: This function handles the main logic of the problem.

3. **Function 4 Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: It initializes a set `ans` with the starting position `x`.
   - **Loop through Throws**: It iterates `m` times, where each iteration processes one throw.
     - **Reading Input**: It reads the distance `r` and direction `c` of the throw.
     - **Updating Possible Positions**:
       - If the direction is known (`'0'` for clockwise or `'1'` for counterclockwise), it updates the set `ans` accordingly.
       - If the direction is unknown (`'?'`), it updates the set `ans` for both possible directions.
   - **Adjustment for Zero Index**: After processing all throws, it adjusts the set `ans` to ensure that `0` is replaced with `n` if present.
   - **Output**: It prints the number of possible positions and the positions themselves in increasing order.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly handles both known and unknown directions.
   - The modulo operation ensures that positions wrap around correctly.
   - The final adjustment for `0` to `n` is correctly implemented.
   - The output format matches the required format.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
