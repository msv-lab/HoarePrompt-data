Postcondition: **`ans` is a set of integers representing the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws, calculated based on the operations performed in each iteration of the loop. The set `ans` includes 0, and the set starts with the player `x` and updates in each iteration by adding new positions derived from the current set using the values of `r` and the condition specified by `c`.**
