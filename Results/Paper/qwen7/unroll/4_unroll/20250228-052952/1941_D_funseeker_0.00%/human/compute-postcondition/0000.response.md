Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` is an integer representing the number of throws (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`. The function `func_3()` has been called and it has updated the values of `n`, `m`, and `x`.**

This means that the function `func_3()` has been executed, and it has modified the values of `n`, `m`, and `x`. However, the exact new values of these variables are not specified, so we only know that they are within their respective ranges. The variable `ans` remains unchanged as it was initialized with the player `x`.
