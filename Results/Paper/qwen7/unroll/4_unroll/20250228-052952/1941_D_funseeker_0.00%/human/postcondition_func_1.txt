The function does not accept any direct parameters but relies on the execution of `func_1()`. It processes test case parameters including an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), integers `n`, `m`, and `x` (2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, 1 <= x <= n), and a list of `m` tuples, each containing an integer `r_i` (1 <= r_i <= n - 1) and a character `c_i` ('0', '1', or '?'). The function ultimately returns an integer value calculated by `func_1()` based on these parameters.
