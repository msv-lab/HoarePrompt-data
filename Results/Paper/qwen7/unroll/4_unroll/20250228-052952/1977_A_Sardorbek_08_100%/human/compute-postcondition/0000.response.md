Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, a is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of the integer input, while the variable `t` remains unchanged as the code only affects `a`. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 is still valid.
