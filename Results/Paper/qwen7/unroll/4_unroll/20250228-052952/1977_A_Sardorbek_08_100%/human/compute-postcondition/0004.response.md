Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( b \) and \( c \) (where \( 1 \leq b, c \leq 100 \)). For each test case, it prints one of four possible responses: 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No'. The decision on which response to print is based on the values of \( b \) and \( c \) according to specified conditions. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.**
