State: **`tests` must be an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` starts at 0 when the loop begins.
2. The loop condition `range(tests)` means that the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i < tests`.
3. For the loop to execute, `tests` must be a positive integer (since `range(0)` would result in no iterations).
4. Given that `tests` is an integer input value between 1 and 1000, inclusive, we need to ensure that this condition is met.
5. Therefore, before entering the loop, `tests` must be within the specified range, and `i` must be initialized to 0.

Thus, the required state adjustments are:
- `tests` must be an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
- `i` must be 0.
