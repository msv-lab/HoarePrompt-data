Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Specifically, we want to maximize the expression:
\[ \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

### Given Program
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(' '.join(ar))
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The program sorts the array `ar` in ascending order using `sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))`.
   - It then converts the sorted list of integers to a list of strings using `map(str, ...)`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the sorted array as a string of space-separated values using `' '.join(ar)`.

### Issues with the Program
1. **Incorrect Approach**:
   - The program sorts the array in ascending order and prints it. However, sorting does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array.
   - To maximize the beauty, we should aim to maximize the positive differences \(a_i - a_{i-1}\). This means we should place the largest element at one end and the smallest at the other end, alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the example input `[2, 1, 3]`, the program would sort it to `[1, 2, 3]` and output `1 2 3`. The beauty would be calculated as \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2\), which is correct.
   - However, for the input `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, the program would sort it to `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]` and output `43 54 80 90 100`. The beauty would be calculated as \((54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 114\), but the optimal arrangement would be `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]` to get \((43 - 100) + (90 - 43) + (54 - 90) + (80 - 54) = -57 + 47 - 36 + 26 = -20\).

### Conclusion
The given program does not solve the problem correctly because it simply sorts the array, which does not guarantee the maximum beauty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
