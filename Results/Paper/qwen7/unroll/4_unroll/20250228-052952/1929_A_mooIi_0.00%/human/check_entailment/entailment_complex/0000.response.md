Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \). However, the function simply sorts the array and prints it, which does not maximize the beauty of the array.

To maximize the beauty, we should place the largest element at the beginning and the smallest at the end, and then alternate between the largest remaining elements and the smallest remaining elements. This ensures that the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) are maximized.

The current function does not implement this logic; instead, it sorts the array and prints it, which results in a non-optimal solution for maximizing the beauty.

Correctness: **False**
