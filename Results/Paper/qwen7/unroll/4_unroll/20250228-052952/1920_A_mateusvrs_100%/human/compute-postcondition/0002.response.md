Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(t):` statement. This means the loop variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the value `t` are relevant to the loop's execution.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute, the value of `t` must be at least 1. Since the initial state is given as `t` being an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), we know that `t` is already within the valid range. However, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to confirm that `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Consider the loop body**: The loop body is omitted, but the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning its specific value within the loop is not important for the loop's execution. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `_`.

4. **Other states**: The state of `n` and `r` (the empty list) do not affect the loop's execution and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `t` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
