Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `r` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `r`. This does not change the values of `t` or `n`, but it adds a new variable `r` which is an empty list. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of `t` and `n`, while adding the new variable `r` with its current state being an empty list.
