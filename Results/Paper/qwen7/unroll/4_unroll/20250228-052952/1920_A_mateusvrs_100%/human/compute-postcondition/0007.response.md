Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and `n` integers representing constraints. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the constraints and stores these values in a list `r`. Finally, it prints the elements of `r`, each on a new line. The values in `r` are determined by comparing the maximum value of type 1 constraints (`bx`) with the minimum value of type 2 constraints (`ax`), and counting the number of type 3 constraints within this range. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, the result is 0; otherwise, it calculates the difference between `ax` and `bx` and subtracts the count of type 3 constraints within this range.**
