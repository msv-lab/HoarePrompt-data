Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases.
2. **Parsing Data**: It extracts the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `a` from the split data.
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Total Water Calculation**: It calculates the total amount of water in all containers.
   - **Divisibility Check**: It checks if the total water is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'No'.
   - **Target Amount**: It calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`total_water // n`).
   - **Distribution Check**: It iterates through each container and checks if redistributing the water can achieve the target amount without any container having a negative amount of water. If at any point the remaining water in a container becomes negative, it returns 'No'.
   - **Final Check**: If the loop completes without returning 'No', it means the water can be evenly distributed, so it returns 'Yes'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Correctness: **True**
