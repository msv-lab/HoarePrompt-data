Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `water` which iterates over the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `water` will take on each value from the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.
   - The list `a` itself is not directly modified within the loop, but its values are accessed.

3. **Initial state of the given variables**:
   - `total_water` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`.
   - `container` is initially 0.

4. **Adjusting the state**:
   - Since `water` is the variable being iterated over, it needs to be initialized to the first element of the list `a`.
   - The list `a` itself does not need to be adjusted as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `total_water`, `n`, `target`, and `container` do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head and their values remain unchanged throughout the loop.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `water` should be set to the first element of the list `a`.

**State:**
**`water` is the first element of the list `a`, `total_water` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, and `container` is 0.**
