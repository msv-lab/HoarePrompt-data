Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful.
2. A beautiful array can be modified by replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.
3. The provided solution attempts to find the minimum length of contiguous subarrays where all elements are the same (`same` variable). It then determines the minimum length of such subarrays across the entire array.
4. The logic for finding these contiguous subarrays seems flawed because:
   - The code increments `i` twice when switching to a new subarray, which skips over elements and may miss some valid subarrays.
   - The `minn` variable is updated only when a different element is encountered, but this does not account for the possibility of multiple valid subarrays within the same segment.
5. The solution does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition of the array.
6. The logic fails to handle the requirement of making the array non-beautiful, as it does not properly track the necessary removals.

Given these points, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
