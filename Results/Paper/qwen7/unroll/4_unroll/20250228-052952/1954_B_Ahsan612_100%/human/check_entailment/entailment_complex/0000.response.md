Reasoning:

1. **Function Structure**: The function iterates through each test case, reading the size of the array and the array itself. It then processes the array to find the minimum length of any segment where the elements are the same.

2. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The function initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array.
   - It then iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element matches `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element does not match `num`, it updates `num` to the current element, resets `same` to 1, and updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time to account for the final segment.
   - If `minn` remains infinity (`inf`) or equals the length of the array, it prints `-1`, indicating that no such segment exists or the array is uniform.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the array is uniform (all elements are the same).
   - It correctly identifies the minimum length of any segment where the elements are the same.
   - It correctly outputs `-1` when no such segment exists or the array is uniform.

4. **Input Constraints**:
   - The function correctly handles the constraints on the number of test cases and the size of the arrays.

Given the analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
