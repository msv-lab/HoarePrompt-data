Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list of n integers a where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The function returns information based on the given test case data.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. It processes these inputs and provides some form of output based on the given constraints and data.
