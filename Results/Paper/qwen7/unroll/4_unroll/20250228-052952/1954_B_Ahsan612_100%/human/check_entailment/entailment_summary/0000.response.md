Reasoning:
1. The program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
2. A beautiful array can be reduced to an array of identical elements by repeatedly applying the specified operation.
3. The program iterates through the array to find the minimum length of segments where the elements are the same.
4. If there are no such segments or the entire array is uniform, it outputs -1.
5. The logic to find the minimum length of such segments seems to be flawed because it does not correctly identify the segments where the elements are the same and does not ensure the array stops being beautiful after removals.

Specifically, the program:
- Initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to `ar[0]`.
- Iterates through the array, counting consecutive identical elements.
- Updates `minn` with the minimum count of consecutive identical elements found.
- However, this approach does not guarantee finding the correct segments needed to make the array non-beautiful.

Given the execution summary and the problem statement, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It fails to ensure that the array stops being beautiful after removing the minimum number of elements.

Correctness: **False**
