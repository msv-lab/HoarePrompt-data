### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) when \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func` processes each test case.
   - It reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes variables to track the current sequence length (`same`), the target value (`num`), and the minimum sequence length found (`minn`).
   - It iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are the same.
   - When a different element is encountered, it updates the minimum sequence length and resets the count.
   - Finally, it prints `-1` if no sequence of non-identical elements was found, otherwise, it prints the length of the shortest sequence of identical elements.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for finding the shortest sequence of identical elements is correct. This sequence is crucial because removing any element from this sequence would break the condition for the array to remain beautiful.
   - The code correctly identifies the minimum sequence length and handles the edge cases where the entire array is identical or no such sequence exists.
   - The solution adheres to the constraints and requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
