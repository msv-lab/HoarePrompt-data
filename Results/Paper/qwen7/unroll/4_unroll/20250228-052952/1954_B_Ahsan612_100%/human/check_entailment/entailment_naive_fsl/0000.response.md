Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the array has alternating elements, which can still be considered beautiful according to the problem description. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. According to the problem, this array is beautiful because you can choose `i = 2` and replace `a_2` with `a_1`, making the array `[1, 1, 1, 2, 1]`, and then choose `i = 4` and replace `a_4` with `a_3`, making the array `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.

However, the program incorrectly outputs `1` for this case, suggesting that only one element needs to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. This is incorrect because removing just one element (`1` at index `1` or `3`) would not prevent the array from being beautiful, as you could still perform the necessary operations to make all elements the same.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly identify and handle such alternating patterns in the array.
