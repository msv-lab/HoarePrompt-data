Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function correctly initializes necessary variables and reads the input data for the disks.
   - It then iterates over each disk, performing a DFS if the disk hasn't been visited yet.
   - During the DFS, it updates the coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) for each disk based on the touching condition.
   - After completing the DFS for each unvisited disk, it checks if any of the DFS results in a non-zero coefficient sum (`c1`), which would indicate that the radii can be adjusted to satisfy the problem's requirements.
   - If such a condition is met, it prints "YES" and returns. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

2. **Function `dfs()`**:
   - The DFS function correctly marks the current disk as visited and adds its index to the `nodes` list.
   - It then iterates over all disks to check if they touch the current disk.
   - If a touching disk is found and hasn't been visited, it updates the coefficients and recursively calls itself for the touching disk.
   - This process ensures that all disks that are connected through a chain of touching relationships are visited and their coefficients are updated.

Given the detailed logic and the state transitions described, the functions collectively ensure that the problem's requirements are met. The DFS traversal ensures that all touching relationships are considered, and the coefficient updates ensure that the sum of radii can be reduced while maintaining the touching relationships.

Correctness: **True**
