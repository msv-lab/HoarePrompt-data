Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that both `func_1` and `dfs` behave as expected according to the problem statement and the provided execution summaries.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
1. **Reading Input**: The function correctly reads the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk.
2. **Initialization**: It initializes arrays for `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` and creates an empty list `nodes`.
3. **DFS Traversal**: For each unvisited disk, it initiates a DFS call. The DFS updates the coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) and tracks visited disks.
4. **Coefficient Check**: After completing the DFS for each disk, it checks if any DFS resulted in a non-zero coefficient sum (`c1 != 0`). If so, it prints 'YES', indicating that it's possible to adjust the radii as required. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis of `dfs`:
1. **Marking Visited Disk**: The function marks the current disk as visited and adds its index to the `nodes` list.
2. **Checking Touching Condition**: For each unvisited disk `j` that touches the current disk `i`, it updates the coefficients based on the touching condition.
3. **Recursive Call**: It recursively calls `dfs` on all directly touching unvisited disks.

### Validation Against Problem Description:
- **Touching Disks**: The algorithm correctly identifies which disks are touching by checking the distance between their centers against the sum of their radii.
- **Coefficient Update**: The coefficients are updated correctly to reflect the relationship between touching disks.
- **Non-Zero Coefficient Sum**: The final check for a non-zero coefficient sum ensures that at least one set of touching disks can have their radii adjusted to meet the criteria.

Given that both functions work as intended and follow the logic described in the problem statement, the overall program should correctly determine if it's possible to adjust the radii of the disks as specified.

Correctness: **True**
