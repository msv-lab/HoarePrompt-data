Precondition: **n is an integer representing the number of disks, x is a list of integers where x[i] represents the x-coordinate of the center of the i-th disk, y is a list of integers where y[i] represents the y-coordinate of the center of the i-th disk, r is a list of integers where r[i] represents the radius of the i-th disk, visited is a boolean list of length n indicating whether each disk has been visited, and coef0 and coef1 are lists of length n used to store coefficients during the DFS traversal.**
