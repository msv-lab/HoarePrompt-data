Postcondition: **`visited` is a list of length `n` where each element is `True`, `x` is a list of length `n` containing `int` values, `y` is a list of length `n` containing `int` values, `r` is a list of length `n` containing `int` values, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where each element is `0`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where each element is `1`, `nodes` is an empty list, and `ok` remains unchanged (either `True` or `False`).**
