Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- The initial state provides the values and conditions for various lists and variables.
- `visited` is a list of length `n` where each element is `True`.
- `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` containing integer values.
- `coef0` is a list of length `n` where each element is `0`.
- `coef1` is a list of length `n` where each element is `1`.
- `nodes` is an empty list.
- `ok` is `False`.

The `print('NO')` statement directly prints the string `'NO'`. There are no variables or objects within this statement that need further evaluation or substitution based on the given initial state. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'NO'`.
