Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes necessary variables.
2. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the connections between disks that are tangent to each other.
3. During the DFS, it updates the coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) for each disk based on the tangency condition.
4. After the DFS, it checks if any disk has a non-zero coefficient in `coef1` (indicating a potential reduction in radius while maintaining tangency).
5. If at least one disk has a non-zero coefficient in `coef1`, it prints "YES" indicating that it's possible to reduce the sum of radii while maintaining the tangency and no overlap conditions.
6. If no disk has a non-zero coefficient in `coef1`, it prints "NO".

The logic in the program matches the problem statement and examples provided. The DFS correctly identifies the connections between tangent disks, and the check at the end ensures that the sum of radii can be reduced without violating the tangency and non-overlap conditions.

Correctness: **True**
