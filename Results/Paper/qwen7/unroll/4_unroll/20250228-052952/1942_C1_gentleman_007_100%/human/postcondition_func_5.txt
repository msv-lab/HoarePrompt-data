The function `func_6` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon, and `m` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. The function initializes a 2D list `l` of size (n+1)x(n+1) and sets 8 specific positions within this list to 1, based on the indices returned by `func_1()` for 4 iterations. These positions are symmetric, meaning if `[x][y]` is set to 1, then `[y][x]` is also set to 1. After completing these operations, the function returns the 2D list `l`.
