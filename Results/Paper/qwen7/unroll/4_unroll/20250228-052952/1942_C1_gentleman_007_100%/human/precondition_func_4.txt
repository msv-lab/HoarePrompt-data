n is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, m is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and l is a list of empty lists with indices ranging from 0 to n. The function `func_1()` is called m times to populate the adjacency lists in l, where each call to `func_1()` returns a tuple of two integers (x, y) representing the vertices connected by a diagonal.
