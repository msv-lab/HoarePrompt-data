Precondition: **num is a non-negative integer.** 

However, based on the problem description and the function provided, the variable `num` in the function `func_11` does not seem to be relevant to the problem of maximizing the number of triangular pieces of cake. The function `func_11` appears to be calculating prime numbers up to `num`, but this is not directly related to the cake cutting problem described. The actual parameters that should be considered for the cake cutting problem are `n`, `x`, and `y`, which are not present in the provided function.

Given the context of the problem, the precondition should focus on the parameters `n`, `x`, and `y`:

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y is an integer such that y = 0.**
