The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads three integers (n, x, y) from standard input. It ensures that n is between 4 and 10^9, x is between 2 and the minimum of n or 2 * 10^5, and y is 0. The function returns a tuple containing these integers for each test case.
