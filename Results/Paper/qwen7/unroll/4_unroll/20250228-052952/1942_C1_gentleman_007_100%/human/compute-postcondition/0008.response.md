Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list `l` and returns a 2D list `p` of dimensions (n+1) x (m+1). Each element `p[i][j]` in the returned list is computed as the sum of the top (`p[i-1][j]`), left (`p[i][j-1]`), and the top-left diagonal element (`p[i-1][j-1]`) of the previous step, minus the value of the top-left diagonal element of the previous step (`p[i-1][j-1]`). The first row and first column of the returned list `p` are initialized to zero.**
