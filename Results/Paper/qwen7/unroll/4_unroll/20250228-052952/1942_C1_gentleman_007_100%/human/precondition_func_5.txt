n is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, m is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the function `func_1()` returns two integers x and y which represent the indices of the vertices Bessie has chosen. Additionally, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ m ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and m = 4.
