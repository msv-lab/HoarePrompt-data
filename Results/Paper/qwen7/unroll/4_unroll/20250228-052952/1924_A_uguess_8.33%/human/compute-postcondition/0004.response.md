Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \), and a string \( s \). It then checks if the string \( s \) contains at least \( n \) unique substrings of length \( k \). If so, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" followed by a constructed string based on the remaining characters needed to meet the condition. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
