Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Bitmasking Logic**: The bitmask logic used to track the presence of characters in the string `s` is incorrect. The bitmask should be updated based on the characters present in `s`, but the current implementation does not correctly handle this.

2. **Character Tracking**: The variable `cur` is used to track the bitmask, but it's not correctly updated to reflect the presence of all required characters in the string `s`.

3. **Counting Valid Subsequences**: The count `cnt` is incremented whenever all characters up to `k-1` are found in the string `s`. However, this logic does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are checked.

4. **Generating the Result String**: The generation of the result string `ans` is flawed. It incorrectly constructs the string based on the bitmask, which is not correctly updated.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are checked against the string `s`. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from itertools import product

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        
        # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k lowercase English alphabets
        all_possible_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]
        
        # Check if all possible strings are subsequences of s
        found = True
        for string in all_possible_strings:
            if not is_subsequence(string, s):
                found = False
                break
        
        if found:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            # Find and print one such string that is not a subsequence
            for string in all_possible_strings:
                if not is_subsequence(string, s):
                    print(string)
                    break

def is_subsequence(s, t):
    it = iter(t)
    return all(c in it for c in s)

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution uses `itertools.product` to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It then checks if each generated string is a subsequence of `s`. If any string is not a subsequence, it prints 'NO' and one such string. If all strings are subsequences, it prints 'YES'.
