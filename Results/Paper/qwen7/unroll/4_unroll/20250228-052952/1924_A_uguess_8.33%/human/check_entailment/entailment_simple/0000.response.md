### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`. This part is correct.

2. **Subsequence Check**: The program uses a bitmask (`cur`) to keep track of which characters have been seen so far in the string `s`. It iterates through each character in `s`, updates the bitmask, and checks if all `k` characters have been seen (`cur == (1 << k) - 1`). This logic is correct for determining if a subsequence of length `k` exists.

3. **Counting Valid Subsequences**: The variable `cnt` keeps track of how many valid subsequences of length `k` have been found. This is used to determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences of `s`.

4. **Output Handling**: 
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program prints "YES", indicating that all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences of `s`.
   - If `cnt` is less than `n`, the program prints "NO" and constructs a string `ans` that represents a sequence of length `n` which cannot be formed as a subsequence of `s`. The construction of `ans` is based on the bitmask `cur` and ensures that the string does not contain a subsequence that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases appropriately, such as when `cnt < n`, ensuring that the output string `ans` is constructed correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
