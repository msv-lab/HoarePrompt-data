Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It returns 1 in Case_1, and -1 in Case_2.**

This means the function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, along with two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and another integer `k`. Based on some internal logic (not specified here), the function will either return 1 or -1, with each return value corresponding to a specific condition or case.
