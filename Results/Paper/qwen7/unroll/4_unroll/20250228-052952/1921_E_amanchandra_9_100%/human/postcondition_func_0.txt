The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b). For each test case, it compares the positions x_a and x_b. If x_a is greater than x_b, it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates a range based on the difference between x_a and x_b and checks if the position b (or d) falls within this range. Depending on the result, it prints either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
