Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Position Comparison**: The program compares the initial vertical positions (`a` for Alice and `c` for Bob). If Alice's position is greater than Bob's, the game is a draw because Alice cannot catch up to Bob.
3. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the minimum number of steps required for Alice to potentially catch up to Bob (`x = abs(a - c) // 2`). If the distance between Alice and Bob is odd, it adjusts the possible range of columns where Alice can move.
4. **Win Condition Check**: The program checks if Alice can catch Bob within the possible range of moves. If Alice can catch Bob, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".

The logic handles all edge cases and follows the rules specified in the problem statement accurately. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.
