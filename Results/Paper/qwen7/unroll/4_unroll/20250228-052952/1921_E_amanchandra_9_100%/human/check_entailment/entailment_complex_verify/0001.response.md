### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It correctly maps the input values for each test case into variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` representing the height, width, Alice's position, Bob's position, and the board dimensions.

2. **Base Case Check:**
   - The program checks if Alice's row (`a`) is greater than Bob's row (`c`). If true, it prints 'Draw'. This is correct because if Alice is already in a higher row than Bob, neither can capture the other since Alice can only move down and Bob can only move up.

3. **Relative Position Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the absolute difference between Alice's row (`a`) and Bob's row (`c`) and checks if this difference is odd or even.
   - If the difference is odd, it calculates the range of possible moves for Alice (`l` and `r`) and checks if Bob's column (`b`) falls within this range.
   - If the difference is even, it calculates the range of possible moves for Bob (`l` and `r`) and checks if Alice's column (`a`) falls within this range.

4. **Winning Conditions:**
   - The logic for checking if Bob's or Alice's current column falls within the calculated range is flawed. Specifically, the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` should be checked more carefully.
   - The current implementation assumes that if Bob's or Alice's column is within the calculated range, the player can capture the opponent, which is not always true. For example, if the calculated range is `[3, 5]` and Bob's column is `4`, it does not guarantee that Bob can move to column `4` in one step.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the board dimensions might cause the calculated ranges to be out of bounds. For example, if `l` or `r` exceeds the board width, the logic might fail.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly determine the winning conditions and fails to handle edge cases properly. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution has logical flaws in determining the winning conditions and handling edge cases. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
