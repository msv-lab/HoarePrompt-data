Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes six positive integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. It returns a value based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to take six integers as inputs indirectly through a structure like a list or tuple, process them according to the given constraints, and return a result based on the conditions specified.
