Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. Let's consider a few test cases:

1. **Test Case**: `6 5 2 2 5 3`
   - Alice starts at (2, 2), Bob at (5, 3).
   - Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left.
   - Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left.
   - The program incorrectly prints "Draw" because it does not properly evaluate the optimal moves for both players.

2. **Test Case**: `4 1 2 1 4 1`
   - Alice starts at (2, 1), Bob at (4, 1).
   - Alice can only move down (to (3, 1)).
   - Bob can only move up (to (3, 1)), which would result in a win for Alice.
   - The program incorrectly prints "Draw".

The program fails to correctly simulate the optimal moves for both players and determine the winner based on the rules provided. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
