Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) to each vertex.
   - Edges are added between pairs of vertices \((i, j)\) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the number of cliques needed (`cliques`) using `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess` with zeros.
   - It calls `make_array` to fill these arrays based on the calculated cliques.

3. **Function `make_array`:**
   - This function fills the array `arr` and the corresponding `cliquess` array.
   - It takes parameters `left`, `right`, and `clique`.
   - It splits the range `[left, right]` into two parts and assigns elements to ensure the conditions for forming cliques are met.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Number of Cliques Calculation:**
   - The calculation `cliques = ceil(n / k)` is correct. This ensures that the number of cliques is minimized while satisfying the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

2. **Array Initialization:**
   - `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized correctly with zeros.

3. **Filling the Arrays:**
   - The `make_array` function logic seems to be designed to create a pattern where vertices within the same clique are close to each other in both index and value.
   - However, the implementation of `make_array` is flawed:
     - The indices used in the assignment loop do not match the intended logic.
     - The logic for splitting the range and assigning values does not correctly form the required cliques.

### Example Test Case Analysis:

Given the example test cases:
- For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \):
  - Expected output: `2 1` (one clique), `1 1`
  - Actual output: `2 1` (one clique), `1 1`
  - This seems correct.

- For \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 4 \):
  - Expected output: `3 1 5 2 4` (two cliques), `2`, `1 1 2 1 2`
  - Actual output: `3 1 5 2 4` (two cliques), `2`, `1 1 2 1 2`
  - This seems correct.

- For \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 16 \):
  - Expected output: `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8` (one clique), `1`
  - Actual output: `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8` (one clique), `1`
  - This seems correct.

### Conclusion:

While the logic in the program appears to work for the given examples, the implementation of `make_array` is flawed. The indices used in the assignment loops do not correctly form the required cliques. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
