Output State: `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier for the elements in the specified range, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left - mid + 1`, `arr` is a list where for each `i` in the range `[left + mid - 1, right]` (inclusive), `arr[i] = small_element + (mid - 1 - (i - (left + mid - 1)))` if `i` is less than `left + mid`, otherwise `arr[i] = big_element - (i - (left + mid - 1))`, and `cliquess` is a list where for each `i` in the range `[left, left + mid - 1)` (inclusive), `cliquess[i] = clique`.
