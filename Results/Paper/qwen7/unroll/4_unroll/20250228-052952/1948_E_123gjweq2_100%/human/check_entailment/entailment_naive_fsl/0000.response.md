Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to partition the graph into the minimum possible number of cliques based on the given constraints. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques as described.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 5`, `k = 4`

According to the problem description, the graph should be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques. However, the current implementation assigns all vertices to a single clique, which may not always result in the minimum number of cliques.

For example, if we assign the values `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` to the vertices, the graph will have edges between all pairs of vertices because `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= 4` for all pairs `(i, j)`. This results in a single clique containing all vertices, which is not necessarily the minimum number of cliques.

A correct solution would involve more sophisticated logic to ensure that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The current implementation does not achieve this, hence the program is incorrect.
