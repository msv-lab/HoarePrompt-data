Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)` and then tries to fill the array `arr` and the list `cliquess`. However, the logic inside the function `make_array` is incorrect and does not properly assign values to `arr` and `cliquess`.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - The function `make_array` is supposed to fill the array `arr` and the list `cliquess` based on the given parameters `left`, `right`, and `clique`.
   - The logic within `make_array` is flawed. It incorrectly assigns elements to `arr` and `cliquess` without considering the constraints of the problem.
   - Specifically, the assignment of elements to `arr` and `cliquess` is not done in a way that ensures all conditions of the problem are met, particularly the condition that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of the functions does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The approach taken does not consider the specific constraints and requirements of the problem, such as the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| â‰¤ k`.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to devise a strategy that ensures the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques while satisfying the given constraints. The current implementation does not achieve this.
