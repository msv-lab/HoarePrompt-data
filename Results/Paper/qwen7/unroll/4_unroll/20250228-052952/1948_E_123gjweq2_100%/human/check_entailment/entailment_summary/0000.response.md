Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the provided functions meet the requirements of the problem statement. Specifically, we need to check if the functions generate a valid assignment of integers to vertices, form a graph according to the given condition, and partition the graph into the minimum possible number of cliques.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)` and initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`.
   - It then calls the `make_array` function to fill `arr` with values such that each segment of `arr` is set to the same value, resulting in `arr` being a list of `n` ones.
   - The `cliquess` list is also filled with the same clique value for each segment.

2. **Function `make_array`:**
   - This function fills the array `arr` and the list `cliquess` based on the given `left`, `right`, and `clique` parameters.
   - It ensures that the first half of the range `[left, right-1]` is filled with increasing values starting from `left + 1` and the second half is filled with decreasing values starting from `right + 1`.
   - The corresponding entries in `cliquess` are set to the value of `clique`.

### Verification:
- **Assignment of Integers:** The `make_array` function ensures that each segment of `arr` is filled with unique values from `1` to `n`. Since `n` is between `2` and `40`, and `k` is between `1` and `2*n`, the function will always assign unique values to each vertex.
- **Graph Formation:** The graph is formed by adding edges between pairs `(i, j)` if `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`. Given the way `arr` is filled, the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` will hold true for all pairs within the same segment, making each segment a clique.
- **Partition into Cliques:** The `cliquess` list ensures that each vertex belongs to exactly one clique, and the number of cliques is minimized.

Given the above points, the functions correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
