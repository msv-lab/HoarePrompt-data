Output State: **`left` is an integer, `right` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier for the elements in the specified range, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code calculates the midpoint `mid` between `small_element` and `big_element`. Given that `small_element` is `left + 1` and `big_element` is `right + 1`, the expression simplifies to `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`, which further simplifies to `(right - left) // 2`. Therefore, `mid` is updated to this value while all other variables remain unchanged.
