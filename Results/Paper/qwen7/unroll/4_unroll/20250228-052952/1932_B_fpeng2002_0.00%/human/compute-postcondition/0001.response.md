Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `num_tests > 0`.
2. **Current state**: `num_tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
3. **Determine the adjustment needed**: For the loop to execute the first time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

Given that `num_tests` is already within the range of 1 to 1000 (inclusive), it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary.

**Conclusion**: Since the current state already satisfies the loop condition, no changes are needed.

State: **`num_tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive**
