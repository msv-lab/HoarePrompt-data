Output State: **`index` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `data` is a list of strings representing the split input.**

The code simply initializes the variable `index` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t` or `data`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of these variables while updating `index` to 0.
