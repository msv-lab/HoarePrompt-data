Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t, followed by pairs of integers n and q, and a list of n integers a_1,...,a_n. For each query (l, r) given, it returns information about the subarray from index l to r.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value t, and then process pairs of integers n and q, along with a list of n integers. It then processes queries (l, r) and returns specific information about the subarray defined by these indices.
