Output State: **`index` is 2; `t` is an integer value from the list `data` at position 0.**

Explanation: The variable `index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was assigned the integer value from the list `data` at position 0 and the code snippet does not alter this assignment.
