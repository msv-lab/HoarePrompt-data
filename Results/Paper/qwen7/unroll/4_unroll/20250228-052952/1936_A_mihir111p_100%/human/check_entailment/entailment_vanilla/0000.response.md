Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n`.

2. **First Query and Initialization**:
   - The variable `ans1` is initialized to 0.
   - The program performs a series of queries using `func_1` with different combinations of indices.
   - The function `func_1` prints a query and reads the result ('<', '=', '>').

3. **Finding the Maximum OR Value**:
   - The program iterates through indices from 1 to `n-1`.
   - It compares `(p_0 | p_i)` with `(p_0 | p_j)` for some initial `j` (in this case, `i` itself).
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `ans1` to `i`.

4. **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair**:
   - After identifying a potential candidate for `ans1`, the program initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` to `[0]`.
   - It iterates through indices from 1 to `n-1` again.
   - It compares `(p_mx | p_i)` with `(p_ans1 | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it resets `v` and updates `mx` and `v` accordingly.
   - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `v`.

5. **Selecting the Best Candidate**:
   - From the list `v`, the program selects the first element `mx` and sets `ans` to `mx`.
   - It then iterates through the rest of the elements in `v` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_ans | p_v[i])` with `(p_ans | p_ans)`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `ans` to `v[i]`.

6. **Output the Result**:
   - Finally, the program prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the solution.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is used incorrectly. It should compare `(p_a | p_b)` with `(p_c | p_d)`, but the program uses `(p_ans | p_v[i])` and `(p_ans | p_ans)`, which is not aligned with the problem statement.

2. **Incomplete Logic**:
   - The logic for finding the maximum XOR pair is incomplete. The program does not ensure that the selected pair `(ans, ans1)` indeed maximizes the XOR value.

3. **Query Count**:
   - The program might exceed the allowed 3n queries. The current implementation does not guarantee that the number of queries will be within the limit.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
