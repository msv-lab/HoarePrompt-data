Based on the initial state provided, the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that each is within the range 0 to \(n-1\), where \(n\) is a positive integer between 2 and \(10^4\).

The `print` statement outputs a string followed by the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

Output: **? a b c d (where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers in the range 0 to n-1)**
