Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where multiple groups of `k` cards with the same number exist, but their counts are less than `k`. For example, consider the input:

```
5 3
2 2 2 3 3
```

The program will output `5`, but the correct answer should be `3`. Here's why:

- There are three `2`s and two `3`s.
- We can exchange the three `2`s for two `2`s, leaving us with `2 2 3 3`.
- Now we can exchange the two `3`s for one `3`, leaving us with `2 2 3`.

Thus, the minimum number of cards we can have left is `3`.

The current implementation only checks if `k` exists as a value in the frequency table and prints `k - 1` if it does, which is incorrect for this scenario.
