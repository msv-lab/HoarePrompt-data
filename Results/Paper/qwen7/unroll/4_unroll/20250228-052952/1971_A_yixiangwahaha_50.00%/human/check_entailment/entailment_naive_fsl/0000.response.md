Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. The problem states that the first line contains a single integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y`. However, the program reads `t` from the first line but then attempts to read 10 pairs of integers regardless of the value of `t`. This will lead to incorrect behavior if `t` is not equal to 10. For example, if `t` is 5, the program will still attempt to process 10 pairs of integers, leading to incorrect results.
