Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. The problem states that the first line will contain an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line will contain two space-separated integers `x` and `y`. However, the given program assumes that there will be exactly 10 pairs of integers, regardless of the value of `t`.

To fix this, the program should read the value of `t` first and then process exactly `t` pairs of integers. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x = int(xylist[0])
        y = int(xylist[1])
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)

func()
```

This corrected version reads the number of test cases `t`, then processes exactly `t` pairs of integers as specified in the problem description.
