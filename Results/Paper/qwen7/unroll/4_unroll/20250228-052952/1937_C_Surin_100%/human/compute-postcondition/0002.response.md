Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the objects in the loop head:
   - The loop variable `kp` is used in the loop head.

2. Determine the conditions under which the loop can execute:
   - The loop will execute as long as `kp` is less than `int(input())`.

3. Consider the initial state before the loop starts:
   - A lambda function `R` is defined, but this function is not directly related to the loop condition or the loop itself. Therefore, we do not need to adjust its state.

4. Adjust the necessary states:
   - The loop will start when `kp` is 0 and continue until `kp` is less than `int(input())`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `kp` should be initialized to 0, and `int(input())` should be at least 1.

Based on these steps, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`kp` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
