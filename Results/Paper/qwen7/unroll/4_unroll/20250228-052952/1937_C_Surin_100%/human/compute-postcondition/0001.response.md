Output State: **A lambda function `R` is defined which takes input, splits it by spaces, and maps each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code defines a lambda function `R` that takes input, splits it by spaces, and maps each element to an integer. This changes how the `R` function operates but does not assign any specific values to variables or alter the state of any existing variables. Therefore, the only information that remains valid after the code execution is the definition of the `R` function.
