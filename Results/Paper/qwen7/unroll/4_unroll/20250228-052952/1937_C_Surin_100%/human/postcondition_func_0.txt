The function interacts with an external interactor through standard input and output. It processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it determines the position of a specific element in a permutation based on comparison queries. For each test case, it makes up to 3n queries to the interactor and updates variables `v1` and `prev` based on the responses. After processing all queries for a test case, it outputs the final positions of `prev` and `v1`.
