### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can ask at most \(3n\) queries of the form \(\text{"? } a \, b \, c \, d \text{"}\), where the response is either `<`, `>`, or `=` based on the bitwise OR operation results.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code uses a function `func()` to interact with the judge.
   - It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it initializes variables and starts querying indices.

3. **Query Analysis:**
   - The first loop (`for i in range(1, n)`):
     - It asks \(\text{"? } v1 \, v1 \, i \, i \text{"}\).
     - This seems to be comparing the same index twice, which is redundant and does not provide useful information.
   - The second loop (`for i in range(1, n)`):
     - It asks \(\text{"? } v1 \, i \, v1 \, prev \text{"}\).
     - This also seems to be comparing the same index twice, and the logic for updating `prev` is unclear.
   - The final print statement outputs the indices `prev` and `v1`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The code does not seem to correctly implement the strategy to maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\).
   - The queries are not designed to effectively compare different indices to find the maximum XOR.
   - The logic for determining the indices `prev` and `v1` is flawed and does not ensure that the maximum XOR is found.

5. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function summary indicates that the function processes multiple test cases and determines the position of a specific element in a permutation based on comparison queries.
   - However, the provided implementation does not align with the summary's description, as the queries and logic are incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**

However, upon closer inspection, we realize that the original assessment might have overlooked the core logic of the problem. The provided code indeed makes queries but the logic for determining the indices `prev` and `v1` is flawed. The code does not correctly implement the strategy to find the maximum XOR, but it does make the required number of queries and outputs the indices in a structured manner.

Given the problem constraints and the fact that the code makes the required number of queries, we need to re-evaluate the correctness based on the actual behavior of the code rather than the logical flaw in the implementation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem due to the flawed logic for determining the indices `prev` and `v1`. However, it adheres to the query limit and outputs the indices in a structured manner, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for correctness.
