You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The output state will consist of q lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions evaluated for the input values (a, b, c) in each iteration of the loop. The specific content of each line depends on the input provided during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `q` test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, it determines whether the sequence `a, b, c` represents a 'STAIR' (where `a < b < c`) or a 'PEAK' (where `a < b > c`), and prints the corresponding label. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs `q` lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions evaluated for the input values in each iteration.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the conditions for a stair and a peak. Specifically, the program uses `mn = 100` which is unnecessary and does not affect the logic. However, the main issue is that the program does not properly check for both conditions in a single evaluation. It should evaluate both conditions within the same loop to ensure that only one of "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" is printed per test case. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that for each set of inputs, it checks both conditions and prints the appropriate result.
