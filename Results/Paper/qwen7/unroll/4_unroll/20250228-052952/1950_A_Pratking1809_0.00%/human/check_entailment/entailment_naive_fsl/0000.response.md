Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the conditions for a stair and a peak. Specifically, the program uses `mn = 100` which is unnecessary and does not affect the logic. However, the main issue is that the program does not properly check for both conditions in a single evaluation. It should evaluate both conditions within the same loop to ensure that only one of "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" is printed per test case. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that for each set of inputs, it checks both conditions and prints the appropriate result.
