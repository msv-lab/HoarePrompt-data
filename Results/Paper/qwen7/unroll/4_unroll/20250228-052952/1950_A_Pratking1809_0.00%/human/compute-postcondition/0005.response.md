Functionality: **The function processes `q` test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, it determines whether the sequence `a, b, c` represents a 'STAIR' (where `a < b < c`) or a 'PEAK' (where `a < b > c`), and prints the corresponding label. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs `q` lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions evaluated for the input values in each iteration.**
