Output State: t is an input integer, and for each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n; and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. After executing the loop, ans2 contains the maximum value of ans1 after performing the specified operations for each test case. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
