### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting and Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This step is crucial for Alice's strategy to remove the largest elements first.
   - The initial sum `ans1` is calculated as the sum of all elements in the sorted array.

3. **Alice's Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice can remove up to `k` elements. By sorting the array in descending order, she can remove the `k` largest elements to minimize the impact on the sum.
   - The program calculates the new sum `ans1` after removing the `k` largest elements.

4. **Bob's Optimal Strategy:**
   - Bob can negate up to `x` elements. To minimize the sum, he will negate the smallest elements.
   - The program iterates through the sorted array and considers negating the smallest elements. It updates `ans1` accordingly and keeps track of the maximum possible sum `ans2`.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly by ensuring that the operations do not exceed the limits (`k` for removal and `x` for negation).
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), which is within the specified limit.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum possible sum `ans2` for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic for both Alice and Bob to play optimally according to the problem statement.
