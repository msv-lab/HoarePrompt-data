Reasoning:
1. The program is supposed to solve a specific problem related to counting ordered pairs (a, b) under certain conditions.
2. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
3. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, but only uses `n` in the calculation.
4. The function `func_1()` is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
5. However, the current implementation of `func_1()` only uses `n` and does not use `m`. This means the program will not correctly handle the condition involving `m`.
6. The logic inside the function calculates `ans` using a formula that does not account for the condition involving `b` and `gcd(a, b)`.

Given these points, the program is not solving the intended problem correctly because it ignores the second parameter `m` and the condition involving `b`.

Correctness: **False**
