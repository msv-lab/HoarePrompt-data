### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the issues and verify the solution step-by-step.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Program:
1. **Function Definition and Usage**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called with the correct parameters. It expects two arguments `n` and `k`, but these are not used in the problem statement.
   - The main loop reads input and calls `func_1()`, but it should call a function that takes `n` and `m` as parameters.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The program attempts to count the number of valid pairs using a square root-based approach, which is not relevant to the problem. This approach does not consider the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Missing Calculation**:
   - The program does not perform the necessary calculations to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it simply counts some values without considering the actual constraints.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the given condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version iterates over all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly, ensuring that the program correctly counts the number of valid pairs.

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis, the original program is indeed incorrect. The corrected version provided above correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect.
