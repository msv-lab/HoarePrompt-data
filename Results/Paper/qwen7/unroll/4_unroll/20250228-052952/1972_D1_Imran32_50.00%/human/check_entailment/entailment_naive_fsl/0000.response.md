Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. According to the problem, we need to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the program does not check this condition at all. Instead, it calculates a value `ans` which seems to be unrelated to the problem's requirements. Specifically, the loop in `func_1` does not consider the gcd condition or the condition that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

For example, consider the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
- The correct pairs would be \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\).
- However, the program will output 3, which is incorrect because it does not account for the gcd condition and the multiple condition.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
