Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^6, `ans` is equal to `n`**.

The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
