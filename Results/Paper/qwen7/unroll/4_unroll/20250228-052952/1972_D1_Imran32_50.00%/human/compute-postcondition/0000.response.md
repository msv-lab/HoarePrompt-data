Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^6.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input using the `map` function and splits them based on space. The variable `t` remains unchanged, so it retains its initial state where it is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The values of `n` and `k` are assigned the respective integers read from the input, both constrained to be between 1 and 2⋅10^6.
