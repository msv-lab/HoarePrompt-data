### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes two integers `n` and `k` as input.
   - It initializes `ans` with `n`.
   - It calculates `root` as the square root of `n` plus one.
   - It iterates from `2` to `root` and adds `(n + i) // (i * i)` to `ans`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The function does not use the value of `k` at all.
   - The loop does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The loop seems to be counting something related to the square numbers up to the square root of `n`, but it does not relate to the problem's requirements.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
     - Correct pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 3)\).
     - The program outputs 3, which is incorrect because it does not account for the gcd condition and the multiple condition.

4. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the function does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. It calculates a value that is unrelated to the problem's constraints.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. It does not check the necessary conditions and instead performs a calculation that is unrelated to the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not satisfy the conditions specified in the problem description.
