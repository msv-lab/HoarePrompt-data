### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the annotated code based on the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Given Program Analysis
The given program has several issues:
1. **Function Definition and Usage**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called with the correct parameters. It expects two arguments \(n\) and \(k\), but these are not used in the problem statement.
   - The main loop reads input and calls `func_1()`, but it should call a function that takes \(n\) and \(m\) as parameters.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The program attempts to count the number of valid pairs using a square root-based approach, which is not relevant to the problem. This approach does not consider the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Missing Calculation**:
   - The program does not perform the necessary calculations to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it simply counts some values without considering the actual constraints.

#### Correct Approach
To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the given condition. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

#### Annotated Code Analysis
The annotated code provides a detailed state analysis before and after the function call. However, the function `func_1()` is not correctly implemented to solve the problem. The state analysis shows that the function is not performing the necessary checks for the problem constraints.

#### Original Assessment Revisited
The original assessment correctly identified that the given program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program attempts to use a square root-based approach, which is irrelevant to the problem constraints.

#### Final Evaluation
Given that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
