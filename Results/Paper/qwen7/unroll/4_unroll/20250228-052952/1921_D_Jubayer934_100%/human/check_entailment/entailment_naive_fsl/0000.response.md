Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the values in `b` are smaller than the smallest value in `a`. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
4 6
5 1 2 4
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

In this case, the program will sort `a` and `b`, and then try to pair the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b`. However, since the smallest value in `b` is 1, which is less than the smallest value in `a` (which is 1), the program will incorrectly calculate the differences. Specifically, the difference for the first element should be `abs(5 - 1) = 4`, but the program calculates `abs(5 - 6) = 1`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the smallest value in `a` is paired with the smallest value in `b`, and similarly for the largest values. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)
        ans = [abs(a[i] - b[i]) for i in range(n)]
        print(sum(ans))
```

This corrected version ensures that the smallest and largest values are correctly paired, thus maximizing the total difference.
