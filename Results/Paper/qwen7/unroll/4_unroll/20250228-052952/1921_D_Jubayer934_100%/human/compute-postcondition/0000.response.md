Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `_` (an underscore), which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. However, since the loop counter itself is not directly used within the loop, we focus on the input that drives the loop.

2. **Understand the Input:**
   - The loop will run for the number of times specified by the first input value read from the input. This value is stored in the variable `_` in the loop head.

3. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - The initial state before the loop starts is given as `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This means the loop will run exactly `t` times.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop will run `t` times, we need to ensure that the input mechanism provides `t` values. Therefore, the state before the loop should reflect that the input mechanism will provide `t` values, one for each iteration of the loop.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that the input mechanism will provide `t` values, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)**
