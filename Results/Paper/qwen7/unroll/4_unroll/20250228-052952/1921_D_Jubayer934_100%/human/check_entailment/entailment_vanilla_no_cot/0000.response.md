Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly maximize the total difference \(D\). Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Choosing Elements:**
   - The logic inside the `for` loop where it tries to decide whether to use `b[i]` or `b[-(n - i)]` is flawed. It checks if using `b[-(n - i)]` gives a larger absolute difference but doesn't ensure that the overall sum of differences is maximized.
   - The approach of sorting `a` and `b` separately and then trying to match elements from the ends might not always yield the optimal result. 

2. **Improper Handling of Remaining Elements:**
   - After determining the initial `n` elements, the code attempts to append the remaining elements from `b`, but it doesn’t guarantee that the remaining elements are chosen optimally to maximize the difference.

3. **Potential Overlooked Cases:**
   - There could be scenarios where choosing different elements from `b` would yield a higher total difference. The current logic does not explore all possible combinations to ensure the maximum difference.

### Correct Approach:
A more effective strategy would involve sorting both arrays and then pairing the smallest element of `a` with the largest element of `b`, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This ensures that the differences are maximized.

Here’s a revised version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)
        
        # Calculate the maximum difference
        max_diff = sum(abs(a[i] - b[i]) for i in range(n))
        print(max_diff)

# Example usage:
func()
```

This approach ensures that the differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` are maximized, leading to the correct maximum total difference \(D\).
