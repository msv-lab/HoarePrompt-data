Output State: **After executing the loop for all iterations, `t` test cases will have been processed. For each test case, two outputs will be printed: the first is a string `ans` constructed based on the characters from strings `a` and `b`, and the second is an integer `counter` representing the number of consecutive positions where `a[j+1]` equals `b[j]` or `a[j+1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1'. The values of `t` and `n` will be reduced accordingly, and all other variables will be reset at the start of each new test case.**
