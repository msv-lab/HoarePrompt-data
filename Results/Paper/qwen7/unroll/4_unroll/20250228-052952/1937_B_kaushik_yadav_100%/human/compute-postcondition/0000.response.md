Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings `a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n}` are given, where each `a_{ij}` is either 0 or 1; the input function is redirected to read from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline`.**

Explanation: The code `input = sys.stdin.readline` simply redirects the `input` function to read from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline`. This does not change the values of any variables or add any new information. Therefore, the only change is in how input is read, but the initial conditions regarding the variables `t`, `n`, and the binary strings remain unchanged.
