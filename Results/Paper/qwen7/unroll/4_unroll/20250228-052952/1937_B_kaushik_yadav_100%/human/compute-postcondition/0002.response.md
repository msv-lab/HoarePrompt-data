Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute `t` times. Therefore, the value of `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to start executing.

3. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop will iterate `t` times, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

We need to ensure that `t` is within this range for the loop to execute properly.

**Final State Adjustment**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**

This ensures that the loop will execute the required number of times based on the value of `t`.
