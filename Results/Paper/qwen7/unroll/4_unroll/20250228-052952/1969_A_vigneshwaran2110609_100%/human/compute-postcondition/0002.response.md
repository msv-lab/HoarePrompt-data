Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct. The loop prints either "2" or "3" for each iteration based on the condition specified, but the final state of t and p remains unchanged.
