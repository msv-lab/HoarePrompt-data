The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers. For each test case, it reads `n` and a list `l` of integers. It then checks if any element in `l` satisfies a specific condition: `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`. If such an element is found, it prints "2". Otherwise, it prints "3". The function does not modify the input variables `t`, `n`, or `p` and only outputs "2" or "3" for each test case.
