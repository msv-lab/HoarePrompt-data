State: **`t` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(t)` to determine the number of iterations.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be a positive integer.
3. Since `t` is given as an input integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), the smallest possible value for `t` is 1.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given that the initial state is `t` is an input integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), the only adjustment needed is to ensure `t` is greater than 0, which it inherently is within the given range.
