Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), after executing the code, `t` will still be within this range, but its specific value will depend on the user's input. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
