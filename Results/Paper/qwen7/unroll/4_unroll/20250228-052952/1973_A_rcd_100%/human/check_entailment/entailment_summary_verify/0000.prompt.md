You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0
            y = p3
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                    print(p1 - x + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    x += 1
                    y -= 1
            else:
                print(p3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(t\), \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\). For each test case, it checks if the sum \(p_1 + p_2 + p_3\) is even. If the sum is odd, it outputs \(-1\) and moves to the next test case. Otherwise, it calculates and outputs either \(p_1 - x + p_3\) or \(p_3\), depending on the values of \(x\) and \(y\) derived from a specific condition. If no valid \(x\) and \(y\) satisfy the condition, it outputs \(p_3\). The function returns a series of integers or \(-1\) corresponding to each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws that could have happened. Let's consider the following case:

- Input: `1 1 2`
- Expected Output: `2`

According to the problem description, if the scores are `1, 1, 2`, the only way to achieve these scores is through two draws (one draw between the first and second player, and another draw between the first and third player). However, the program does not handle this scenario correctly.

Here’s a breakdown of the issue:
- The program checks if `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` and prints `-1` if true. This condition is not relevant to determining the maximum number of draws.
- The program then checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`. If true, it prints `p1 + p2`, which is incorrect because it doesn’t account for the possibility of draws.
- The subsequent while loop attempts to find a valid combination of wins and draws, but it does not correctly handle all scenarios, especially when the scores indicate multiple draws.

Given the example input `1 1 2`, the program should output `2` (two draws), but it does not do so. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
