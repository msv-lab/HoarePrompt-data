Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
3. The program checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case, which is correct because the sum of scores must be even for a valid set of games.
4. The program then checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If it is, it prints `p1 + p2`, which is the maximum possible number of draws if the scores are consistent with a valid set of games.
5. If the above condition is not met, the program enters a while loop to find the maximum number of draws. This loop attempts to find values of `x` and `y` such that `p1 - x` and `p2 - y` are non-negative and the total number of draws is maximized.
6. The logic inside the while loop seems to be attempting to maximize the number of draws by adjusting `x` and `y` until the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is met, at which point it prints `p1 - x + p3` as the maximum number of draws.
7. If the while loop does not find a valid solution, it prints `p3`, which is the number of wins for the highest-scoring player, indicating that no valid set of games exists to achieve the given scores.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program appears to handle all the necessary conditions and produce the correct output for the examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
