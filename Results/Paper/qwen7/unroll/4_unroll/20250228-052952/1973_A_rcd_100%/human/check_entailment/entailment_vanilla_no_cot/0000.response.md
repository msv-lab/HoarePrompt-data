To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input and Initial Checks**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points**:
   - The program checks if `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 == 0`. This is a necessary condition for the scores to be achievable since each game contributes either 2 points (to one player) or 2 points (1 to each player in case of a draw).

3. **Handling Invalid Scores**:
   - If the total points are not even, the program prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because an odd total score cannot be achieved through the described scoring system.

4. **Handling Valid Scores**:
   - The program then checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`. If this condition holds, it prints `p1 + p2`, which seems incorrect. The correct logic should be to check if `2 * p3 >= p1 + p2` and then calculate the maximum number of draws.

5. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - The program attempts to find the maximum number of draws using a while loop. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. Specifically, the conditions and updates within the loop do not correctly reflect the constraints of the problem.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
