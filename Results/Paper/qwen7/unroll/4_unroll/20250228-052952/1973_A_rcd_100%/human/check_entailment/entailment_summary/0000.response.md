Reasoning:
1. The program correctly identifies if the sum of the scores \(p_1 + p_2 + p_3\) is odd. If it is, the function immediately prints \(-1\), which is correct because an odd sum cannot be achieved with the scoring rules (since each game contributes an even number of points).
2. The program then checks if \(p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2\). If this condition is true, it prints \(p_1 + p_2\). This is incorrect because if \(p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2\), it does not necessarily mean that all points are from draws. For example, consider \(p_1 = 1\), \(p_2 = 1\), and \(p_3 = 2\). Here, \(p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2\) but the maximum number of draws is 1 (one draw between the first and second player, and one win for the third player over either of the first two).
3. The nested while loop is intended to find the maximum number of draws. However, the logic within the loop is flawed. Specifically, the conditions `if p1 - x <= p2 - y:` do not correctly account for the possible distribution of wins and draws among the three players. The loop should aim to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the total points match the given scores.
4. The final output of \(p_3\) when no valid \(x\) and \(y\) are found is incorrect. It does not guarantee the maximum number of draws.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
