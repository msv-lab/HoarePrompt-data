You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices `M` for each of the `n` days.

2. **Setting Up Variables:**
   - `m` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k`, ensuring that the maximum number of tickets purchased per day does not exceed `m`.
   - `M` is sorted to facilitate the greedy approach of buying tickets at the lowest possible prices first.

3. **Calculating the Number of Days Needed:**
   - `q` is calculated as the ceiling of `k / m`, which represents the number of days required to buy `k` tickets if the maximum number of tickets (`m`) can be bought each day.

4. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - If `n * m == k`, it means we can buy all `k` tickets without any price increase. The cost calculation is straightforward.
   - If `n * m != k`, it means we need to buy some tickets on the last day(s) at increased prices. The program handles this by:
     - Removing the highest price from the first `q` days (`w`).
     - Calculating the number of additional tickets (`mu`) that need to be bought on the last day(s).
     - Adjusting the cost calculation accordingly.

5. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost is calculated using the formula:
     - `cost = mu * w`
     - `cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n * m == k` correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where `n * m != k` by adjusting the cost calculation properly.

2. **Greedy Approach:**
   - The program uses a greedy approach to minimize the cost by buying tickets at the lowest possible prices first. This approach is valid given the constraints and the nature of the problem.

3. **Mathematical Formulas:**
   - The mathematical formulas used in the cost calculation are correct and align with the problem statement.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly, including edge cases and the greedy approach to minimize cost.
