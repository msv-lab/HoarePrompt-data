Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
2. The provided program seems to generate a specific pattern of operations that achieve the required result.
3. Let's break down the program:
   - It reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
   - For each test case, it initializes an \( n \times n \) matrix `mat` with values ranging from 1 to \( n \).
   - It calculates the sum \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i+1)(2i+1) \) which is the desired maximum sum for the matrix.
   - It prints this sum and \( 2n \) as the number of operations.
   - It then prints `n` lines with a Type 1 operation setting the first row to the sequence from 1 to \( n \) and `n` lines with a Type 2 operation setting the first column to the sequence from 1 to \( n \).

4. The key part is whether these operations correctly maximize the sum and use no more than \( 2n \) operations.
5. The operations set the first row and the first column to the sequence from 1 to \( n \), which ensures that the diagonal elements (and other elements) will be filled with the highest possible values, thus maximizing the sum.

Given the problem constraints and the operations performed, the program correctly maximizes the sum and uses exactly \( 2n \) operations.

Correctness: **True**
