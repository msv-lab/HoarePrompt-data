Output State: t test cases are printed, each followed by two lines. For each test case:
1. A line containing an integer `res` which is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and an integer `2n`.
2. `n` lines, each starting with '1 n', followed by the numbers from 1 to n.
3. `n` lines, each starting with '2 n', followed by the numbers from 1 to n.

This output state describes the result of processing each test case where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the size of the matrix, and the operations within the loop generate specific patterns based on the value of `n`.
