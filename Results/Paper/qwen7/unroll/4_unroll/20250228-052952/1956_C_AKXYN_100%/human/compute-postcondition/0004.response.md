Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). For each test case, it calculates the sum \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i+1)(2i+1) \) and prints this sum along with \( 2n \). It then prints `n` lines for each test case, each starting with '1 n' followed by the sequence from 1 to n, and another `n` lines starting with '2 n' followed by the same sequence.**
