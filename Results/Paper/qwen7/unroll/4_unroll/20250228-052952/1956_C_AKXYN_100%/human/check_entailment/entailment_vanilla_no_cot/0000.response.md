Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix and uses no more than \(2n\) operations. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Matrix Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes an \(n \times n\) matrix `mat` where each element \(a_{i, j}\) is set to \(j\). This ensures that each row and each column contains a permutation of integers from 1 to \(n\).
3. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the sum of the matrix elements. Given the structure of the matrix, the sum can be computed directly without explicitly summing all elements. The formula used in the code is derived from the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers and their permutations.
4. **Operation Execution**: The program performs \(n\) Type 1 operations and \(n\) Type 2 operations. Each operation sets the appropriate row or column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \(n\). Since the matrix is initialized such that each row and each column already contains a permutation, these operations do not change the values but ensure the conditions are met.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program meets all the criteria and produces the correct output. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **True**.
