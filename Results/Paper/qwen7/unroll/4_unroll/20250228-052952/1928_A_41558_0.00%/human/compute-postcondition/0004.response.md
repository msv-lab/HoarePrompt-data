Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns either an integer result or an error message based on the values of `a`, `b`, and some unspecified logic applied within the function.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing values for `t`, `a`, and `b`. It processes these values according to an unspecified logic and returns a result or an error message for each test case.
