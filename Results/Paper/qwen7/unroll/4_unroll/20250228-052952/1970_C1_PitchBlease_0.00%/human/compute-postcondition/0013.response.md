Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of a tree), and `start` (an integer). It constructs a tree representation using the provided edges. Then, it identifies the two leaves of the tree and calculates the shortest path distances from the `start` node to each leaf. Based on whether these distances are even or odd, the function returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.**
