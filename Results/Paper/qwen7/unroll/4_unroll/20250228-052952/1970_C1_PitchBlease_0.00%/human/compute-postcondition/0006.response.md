Output State: **`tree` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and its value is a dictionary where each key represents a node in the tree, and its corresponding value is a list of nodes connected to it by an edge; `leaves` is a list of nodes that have only one connection in the tree; `dist1` is the shortest path distance from `start` to `leaves[0]` using BFS; `dist2` is the shortest path distance from `start` to `leaves[1]` using BFS.**

Explanation: The code `dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])` calculates the shortest path distance from the starting node (`start`) to the second leaf node (`leaves[1]`) using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. This new distance is stored in the variable `dist2`. The other variables (`tree`, `leaves`, and `dist1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
