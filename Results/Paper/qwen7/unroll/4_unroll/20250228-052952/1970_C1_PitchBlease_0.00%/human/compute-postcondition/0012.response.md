The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `edges`, and `start`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, and `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. 

If the conditions are met, the function returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `edges`, and `start`. It returns 'Ron' in one case and 'Hermione' in another case based on the given conditions.**
