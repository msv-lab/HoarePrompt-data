Postcondition: **`tree` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and its value is a dictionary where each key represents a node in the tree, and its corresponding value is a list of nodes connected to it by an edge; `leaves` is a list of nodes that have only one connection in the tree; `dist1` is the shortest path distance from `start` to `leaves[0]` using BFS; `dist2` is the shortest path distance from `start` to `leaves[1]` using BFS. Either `dist1` is even or `dist2` is even.**
