You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, there are four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `cnt` is calculated based on the given conditions for each test case. Specifically, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s in the input list are all odd, and then `cnt` is further incremented by half the sum of all elements in the list, rounded down. The final value of `cnt` for each test case is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads a list of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. It calculates a total count based on specific conditions: incrementing by 1 if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, and then adding half the sum of all elements in the list, rounded down. Finally, it prints the calculated total count for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Specifically, the program calculates the sum of the counts of numbers divided by 2, which is irrelevant to the problem's requirements. The program should focus on the parity (odd or even) of the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s to determine the optimal strategy for Bob to win.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following:

1. The XOR of all numbers in the sequence determines whether Alice wins (if the result is non-zero) or Bob wins (if the result is zero).
2. Eve's goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins, which means she needs to remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as often as possible.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_bob_wins(p):
    ones, twos, threes, fours = p
    # Calculate the number of times Bob can win
    # Bob wins if the XOR of the sequence is zero
    # We need to ensure that the XOR remains zero after each removal
    # This can be achieved by removing numbers in a way that maintains the parity of the counts
    bob_wins = min(ones, twos, threes, fours)
    # Additional wins can be achieved by removing pairs of numbers that maintain the XOR condition
    additional_wins = min(ones // 2, twos // 2, threes // 2, fours // 2)
    return bob_wins + additional_wins

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max_bob_wins(a))

func()
```

This corrected program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the parity of the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
