Based on the initial state provided:

- `data` is a list of strings.
- `t` is an integer.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array `a`.
- `idx` is an integer greater than `t * (n + 1)`.
- `results` is a list containing the results of calling `func_1(a)` for each iteration of the loop.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `results` is a list that contains the results of calling `func_1(a)` for each iteration of the loop. Since the function `func_1(a)` is called for each iteration, and `n` represents the length of the array `a`, it implies that `results` contains `n` elements, each being the result of `func_1(a)` for one iteration.

2. The `'\n'.join(results)` operation joins all the elements of the `results` list into a single string with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).

3. Therefore, the `print` statement will print each element of the `results` list on a new line.

Given this reasoning, the output will be:

Output: **each element of the `results` list on a new line**
