Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: From the given state before the loop, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`. This means `t` is set based on the first element of the list `data`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is derived from `data[0]`, we need to ensure that `data[0]` is a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `t` (which is `data[0]`) is a positive integer. Additionally, we need to ensure that `data` is a list of strings containing the input split by spaces, and `data[0]` should be a positive integer.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `data` and `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the input split by spaces, `t` is a positive integer (specifically, `data[0]`)**
