Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the input split by spaces, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array `a`.**

Explanation: The code reads all input from standard input at once using `input()`, splits the input into a list of strings using `split()`, and assigns it to the variable `data`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
