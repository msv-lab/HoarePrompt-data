Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the input split by spaces, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array `a`, and `idx` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[idx]` to `t`. Given that `idx` is initially 0, `t` is assigned the first element of the list `data`. The other variables remain unchanged, so `n` and `idx` retain their original conditions and values.
