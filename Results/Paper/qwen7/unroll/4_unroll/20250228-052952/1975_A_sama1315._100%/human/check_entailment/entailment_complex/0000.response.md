### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - The solution involves checking if the array, when concatenated with itself, contains a subsequence that matches the sorted version of the original array.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function takes an array `a` and checks if there exists a subsequence in the concatenated array (`a + a`) that matches the sorted version of `a`.
   - The logic is sound because if such a subsequence exists, it means the array can be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order.
   - However, the implementation is flawed:
     - It concatenates `a` with itself, which is unnecessary and inefficient.
     - It checks for a subsequence in the concatenated array, which is not the correct approach. Instead, it should check if the original array can be split and swapped to match a sorted version.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The function correctly handles reading input and processing multiple test cases.
   - However, it relies on `func_1` to determine if the array can be sorted, which, as mentioned, is implemented incorrectly.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, one should:
     - Sort the array.
     - Check if the original array can be split into two parts such that the first part is greater than or equal to the second part in every possible way.
     - This can be done by iterating through the array and ensuring that the maximum value up to the current index is less than or equal to the minimum value from the current index to the end.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because the `func_1` function does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program is **False**.

### Response:
Correctness: **False**
