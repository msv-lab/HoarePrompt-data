Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of subsequent test cases, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) indicating the length of an array a, and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). For each test case, it performs some unspecified operation on the array a and returns the results of these operations.**

Note: The exact operations on the array a are not specified in the given information, so the functionality focuses on the structure and nature of the input and output without detailing the internal processing steps.
