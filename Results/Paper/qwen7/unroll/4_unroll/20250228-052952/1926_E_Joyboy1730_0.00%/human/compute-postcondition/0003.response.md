Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and for each input pair `(n, k)`, the program prints a number based on the conditions specified in the loop body. After all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` remains unchanged, but the output consists of a series of numbers printed during each iteration.
