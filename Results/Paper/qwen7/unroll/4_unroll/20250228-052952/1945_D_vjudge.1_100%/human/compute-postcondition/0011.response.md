Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n (a positive integer), k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), a (a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and b (a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). It computes a list `c` containing the element-wise minimum of lists `a` and `b`. Then, it calculates a suffix sum list `suff` where each element `suff[i]` represents the sum of elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`. Finally, it finds and prints the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range `[0, k)`.**
