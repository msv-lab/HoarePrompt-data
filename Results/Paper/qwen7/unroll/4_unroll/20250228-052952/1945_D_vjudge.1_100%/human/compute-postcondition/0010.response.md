Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n (a positive integer), k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), a (a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and b (a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). It returns a value based on specific conditions involving these parameters.**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.
2. `n` is a positive integer.
3. `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
4. `a` is a list of n positive integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
5. `b` is a list of n positive integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.

Given these constraints, the function's output is determined by specific conditions involving these parameters, but the exact nature of the output is not detailed in the given information.
