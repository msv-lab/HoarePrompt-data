Reasoning:
1. The problem requires generating a permutation of length \( n \) such that no two pairs \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \) and \( (p_j, p_{j+1}) \) exist where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
2. The provided solution in `func_1()` generates a list of integers from 1 to \( t \) and reverses the order of every second element starting from the first.
3. Let's analyze if this approach meets the requirements:
   - For \( t = 4 \), the generated list is `[1, 4, 3, 2]`.
   - For \( t = 3 \), the generated list is `[1, 3, 2]`.

4. Checking the divisibility condition for these permutations:
   - For `[1, 4, 3, 2]`:
     - No pair \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \) and \( (p_j, p_{j+1}) \) exists where both elements in each pair divide the corresponding elements in the other pair.
   - For `[1, 3, 2]`:
     - No pair \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \) and \( (p_j, p_{j+1}) \) exists where both elements in each pair divide the corresponding elements in the other pair.

5. The approach ensures that the generated permutation does not violate the divisibility condition for small values of \( t \). Given the nature of the problem and the constraints, this method seems to work for all valid \( n \) within the specified range.

Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the required logic to generate a valid permutation for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
