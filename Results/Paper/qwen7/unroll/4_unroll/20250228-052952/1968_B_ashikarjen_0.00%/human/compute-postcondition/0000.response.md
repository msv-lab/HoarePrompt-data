Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, n is an input integer, m is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to variables `n` and `m`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and its value is still an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. The values of `n` and `m` are now specific input integers within their respective ranges.
