Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes four indices \(a, b, c, d\) and prints a query in the form of `? a b c d`.
   - It then reads the response from the input and returns it.
   - This function correctly implements the query mechanism described in the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - The function starts by finding the index with the highest single bit set in the permutation. This is done by comparing the bitwise OR of the same index with different indices.
   - The function then finds the second index by comparing the bitwise OR of the first index with different indices and adjusting the second index accordingly.
   - The logic for finding the second index seems flawed. Specifically, the approach used to determine the second index might not always lead to the optimal solution.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Finding the Index with the Highest Single Bit Set**:
   - The function iterates through indices from 1 to \(n-1\) and compares the bitwise OR of the current index with itself (`max_item_idx`) against the bitwise OR of the current index with another index `i`.
   - If the result of the query is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to `i`. This logic is correct in identifying the index with the highest single bit set.

2. **Finding the Second Index**:
   - After identifying the first index (`max_item_idx`), the function iterates through all indices and compares the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` with the current index (`pair_idx`) against the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` with another index `i`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to `i`.
   - If the result is `=`, it further checks the bitwise OR of `pair_idx` with itself against the bitwise OR of `i` with itself. If the result is `>`, it updates `pair_idx` to `i`.

### Issues with the Second Index Finding Logic

- The logic for updating `pair_idx` when the result of the query is `=` is problematic. The additional check (`ans2 == '>'`) is unnecessary and does not guarantee that the maximum XOR is found.
- The approach of simply checking the result of the query without considering the actual values of the bitwise OR results might miss the optimal pair.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the logic for finding the second index, the program might not always find the correct pair of indices that maximize the XOR value. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all test cases.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
