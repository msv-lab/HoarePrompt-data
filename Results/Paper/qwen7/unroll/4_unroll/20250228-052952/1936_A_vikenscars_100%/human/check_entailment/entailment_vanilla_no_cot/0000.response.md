Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the strategy to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Query Strategy**: The function `func_2` attempts to find the index with the maximum bitwise OR (`|`) value by comparing it with other indices. However, this approach does not guarantee finding the pair with the maximum XOR value. The strategy used here is flawed because it only considers individual comparisons and does not leverage the information about the maximum XOR value directly.

2. **Query Limit**: The program is limited to 3n queries, but the current implementation might exceed this limit for larger values of `n`. The logic for selecting pairs and making comparisons is not optimized to ensure the solution is found within the allowed query limit.

3. **Missing Maximization Logic**: The program does not have a mechanism to maximize the XOR value directly. It only finds the maximum OR value and then tries to find the best pair, which is not sufficient to ensure the maximum XOR is found.

### Suggested Approach:
A more effective approach involves leveraging the properties of XOR and OR operations to efficiently find the pair with the maximum XOR value. One possible method is to use a divide-and-conquer strategy or a more sophisticated comparison-based approach to minimize the number of queries while ensuring the maximum XOR is found.

Here’s a high-level outline of a potential correct solution:

1. **Divide and Conquer**: Divide the array into smaller segments and compare segments to narrow down the potential candidates for the maximum XOR.
2. **Efficient Comparison**: Use a more strategic way to compare pairs and eliminate candidates to reduce the number of queries.
3. **Optimize Queries**: Ensure that each query provides useful information to guide the search towards the optimal pair.

Given these points, the provided program does not meet the requirements and thus is incorrect.
