Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` in the first line.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` representing the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

2. **Objective:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers is zero.

3. **Strategy:**
   - The key observation is that the XOR of a sequence of numbers depends on the parity (odd/even count) of the occurrences of each number.
   - Specifically, the XOR of a sequence will be zero if and only if the count of each number (1, 2, 3, 4) is even.

4. **Program Logic:**
   - The program calculates the sum of `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` which represents the number of pairs of each type of number.
   - It also checks the condition `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` which evaluates to 1 if the total number of odd counts among `a`, `b`, and `c` is exactly 3 (indicating that removing one more number will make the XOR zero).

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Pairs Calculation:**
  - `a // 2` gives the number of pairs of 1s.
  - `b // 2` gives the number of pairs of 2s.
  - `c // 2` gives the number of pairs of 3s.
  - `d // 2` gives the number of pairs of 4s.
  - Summing these up gives the total number of pairs, which is the number of times Bob can win if he removes numbers optimally.

- **Odd Count Check:**
  - `a % 2` gives the parity of `a`.
  - `b % 2` gives the parity of `b`.
  - `c % 2` gives the parity of `c`.
  - If the sum of these parities is 3, it means there are exactly three odd counts among `a`, `b`, and `c`. Removing one of these numbers will make the total count even for all types, thus making the XOR zero.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering both the pairs and the odd count condition. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
