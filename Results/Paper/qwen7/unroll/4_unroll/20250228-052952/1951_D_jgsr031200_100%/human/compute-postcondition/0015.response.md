Output State: `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`, `n` is 0.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in `costs`. Initially, `costs[0]` is `n - k + 1` and `costs[1]` is `1`. In each iteration, `curr` is set to `n` divided by the current element in `costs`, then `h` is incremented by `curr`, and `n` is reduced by `i * curr`. Since `n` starts as a positive integer and gets reduced in each iteration, it will eventually become 0. After the first iteration with `i = n - k + 1`, `curr` will be 1 because `n // (n - k + 1)` equals 1. Then `h` will increase by 1 and `n` will be reduced by `n - k + 1`. In the second iteration with `i = 1`, `curr` will be `n // 1`, which is now `n - (n - k + 1)`, so `h` will increase by `n - (n - k + 1)`, and `n` will be reduced to 0.
