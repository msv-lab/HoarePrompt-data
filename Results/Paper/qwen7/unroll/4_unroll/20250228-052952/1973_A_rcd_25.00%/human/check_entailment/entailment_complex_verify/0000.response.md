### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Initial Check for Odd Sum
The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores is odd:
```python
if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
    print(-1)
    continue
```
This ensures that if the sum is odd, the program immediately prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. This part is correct.

#### Handling Scores
The program then checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`:
```python
if p3 >= p1 + p2:
    print(p1 + p2)
```
If this condition is true, the program prints `p1 + p2`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of draws. For example, consider the input `1 1 2`. The scores can be achieved through two draws (each player gets 1 point from a draw). The current implementation does not account for this scenario.

#### Binary Search for Draws
The program then enters a binary search-like loop to find the maximum number of draws:
```python
low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
cur = low
while high >= cur:
    if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
        print(p1 - cur + p3)
        break
    else:
        cur += 1
else:
    print(p3)
```
This part of the code is intended to find the maximum number of draws. However, the logic here is flawed. The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` does not correctly represent the distribution of points among the players. For example, in the input `1 1 10`, the program incorrectly outputs `2` instead of `-1`.

#### Edge Cases
- **Case 1: No Games Were Played**
  - Input: `0 0 0`
  - Expected Output: `0`
  - Program Output: `0`
  - Correct.

- **Case 2: One Draw Between Second and Third Player**
  - Input: `0 1 1`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Program Output: `1`
  - Correct.

- **Case 3: Invalid Scores**
  - Input: `1 1 2`
  - Expected Output: `2` (from two draws)
  - Program Output: `2`
  - Incorrect. The program should output `-1` because the scores cannot be achieved through valid games.

- **Case 4: Invalid Scores**
  - Input: `3 3 3`
  - Expected Output: `-1`
  - Program Output: `-1`
  - Correct.

- **Case 5: Invalid Scores**
  - Input: `3 4 5`
  - Expected Output: `-1`
  - Program Output: `-1`
  - Correct.

- **Case 6: Invalid Scores**
  - Input: `1 1 10`
  - Expected Output: `-1`
  - Program Output: `2`
  - Incorrect. The program should output `-1`.

Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly the cases involving draws and invalid score distributions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all scenarios, as evidenced by the incorrect outputs for certain test cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
