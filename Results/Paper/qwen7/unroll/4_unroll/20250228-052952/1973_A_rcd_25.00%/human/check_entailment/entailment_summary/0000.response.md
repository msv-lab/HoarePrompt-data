Reasoning:

1. **Sum Check**: The program correctly checks if the sum of \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) is even. If the sum is odd, it prints \(-1\), which is correct because an odd sum cannot be achieved through the scoring system described (since each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in total in case of a draw).

2. **Invalid Score Check**: The program correctly handles the case where \(p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2\). In this scenario, it prints \(-1\) because it's impossible for the third player to have more points than the sum of the first two players' points without violating the rules of the game.

3. **Binary Search for Draws**: The program attempts to find the maximum number of draws using a binary search approach. However, the logic for determining the correct value of `cur` might not always be accurate. Specifically, the condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` does not directly translate to finding the maximum number of draws. Instead, it seems to be checking if the current value of `cur` is feasible.

4. **Output Handling**: The program prints the result for each test case, but the logic for calculating the maximum number of draws might not be entirely correct. The approach should focus on maximizing the number of draws while ensuring the scores are consistent.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does handle some edge cases correctly, such as when no games are played (\(p_1 = p_2 = p_3 = 0\)) and when the scores are inconsistent (\(p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2\)). However, it might not handle all edge cases optimally, especially when trying to maximize the number of draws.

Given these observations, the program's logic for finding the maximum number of draws is flawed. It does not ensure that the solution is optimal or even feasible in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
