Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points to the winners or 2 points split between two players in a draw).
   
3. **Initial Check for Consistency:**
   - The program then checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 + p2`, which seems incorrect based on the problem statement. This check should be more detailed to ensure consistency with the rules of the game.

4. **Detailed Check for Draws:**
   - The program calculates `low` and `high` values based on the differences between `p3` and `p1` and `p3` and `p2`.
   - It then enters a loop where it tries to find the maximum number of draws such that the conditions of the game are satisfied.

### Detailed Breakdown of the Logic

- **Condition `p3 >= p1 + p2`:**
  - This condition is used to determine if the scores can be achieved without any draws. However, it doesn't correctly handle the cases where draws might be necessary.

- **Loop to Find Maximum Draws:**
  - The loop iterates from `low` to `high` to find the maximum number of draws.
  - The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is used to check if the current number of draws (`cur`) is feasible.
  - If the condition is met, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks the loop.
  - If the condition is not met, it increments `cur` and continues the loop.

### Correctness of the Program

The program has some logical flaws:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Initial Condition:**
   - The initial check `if p3 >= p1 + p2:` is not sufficient. It should consider the possibility of draws to ensure the scores are consistent.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Draws:**
   - The loop logic does not correctly account for the maximum number of draws. The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is not always correct for determining the maximum number of draws.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
