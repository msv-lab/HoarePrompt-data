Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Initial Check for Validity**: The initial check `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` is not sufficient to determine if the scores can be achieved. This only checks if the total points are even, but it does not ensure that the distribution of wins and draws is possible.

2. **Handling Draw Scores**: The logic to calculate the maximum number of draws is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if p3 >= p1 + p2:` does not correctly handle all scenarios where the scores can be achieved through a combination of wins and draws.

3. **Calculation of Draws**: The method used to calculate the number of draws is overly complex and does not always yield the correct result. The code attempts to find a value of `cur` such that the conditions for wins and draws are met, but this approach is not robust.

4. **Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle all edge cases properly, such as when the scores are inconsistent and should return `-1`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider the following steps:

1. **Check Total Points**: Ensure that the sum of the scores is even because each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 2 points in total (1 point each in a draw).

2. **Calculate Maximum Possible Draws**: Use the fact that each draw gives 1 point to each player, and each win/loss gives 2 points to the winner and 0 to the loser. You can derive the maximum number of draws by considering the constraints and ensuring the scores are achievable.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Check if the total points are even
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of games needed
        min_games = (p3 - p1) // 2 + (p3 - p2) // 2
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        max_draws = (p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * min_games) // 2
        
        # Check if the calculated draws are valid
        if (p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * max_draws) == 2 * min_games:
            print(max_draws)
        else:
            print(-1)

func()
```

This approach ensures that the scores are checked for consistency and calculates the maximum number of draws correctly.
