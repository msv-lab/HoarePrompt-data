### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description, function summary, and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Three friends play chess, and their scores are given as \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) where \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\).
- Each game results in either 2 points for one player and 0 for the other, or 1 point for each player in a draw.
- We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened, or print \(-1\) if the scores are inconsistent.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes multiple test cases, checking if the sum of the scores is even.
- If the sum is odd or \(p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2\), it prints \(-1\).
- Otherwise, it uses a binary search-like approach to find the maximum number of draws.

#### Original Assessment Recap:
- The original assessment concluded that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading \(p1\), \(p2\), and \(p3\).

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program correctly checks if the sum `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. If not, it prints \(-1\), which is correct because the total points must be even.

3. **Initial Check for Maximum Score:**
   - The condition `if p3 >= p1 + p2` is correct. If this condition is true, it means no draws occurred, and the maximum number of draws is `0`.

4. **Finding the Range for Draws:**
   - The calculations of `low` and `high` are correct. `low` is the minimum number of draws required to make the scores consistent, and `high` is the maximum number of draws possible.

5. **Binary Search for Maximum Draws:**
   - The binary search-like approach to find the maximum number of draws is logically sound. It starts from `low` and increments until `high < cur`. For each value of `cur`, it checks if the current configuration of draws is valid by ensuring that `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If the condition is met, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles cases where no valid configuration exists by printing \(-1\) if the loop completes without finding a valid configuration.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
