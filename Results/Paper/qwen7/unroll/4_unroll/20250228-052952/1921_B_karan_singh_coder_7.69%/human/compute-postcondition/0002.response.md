Output State: The output state consists of the result printed for each test case after executing the given loop. For each test case, if the number of '1's in strings `s` and `t` are equal (`s1 == t1`), the output is `s1` if the number of differing positions (`cnt`) is zero, otherwise it is `0`. If the number of '1's in `s` and `t` are different (`s1 != t1`), the output is `(cnt - d) // 2 + d`, where `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.

In simpler terms, the output state is a series of integers representing the results of the described logic for each test case.
