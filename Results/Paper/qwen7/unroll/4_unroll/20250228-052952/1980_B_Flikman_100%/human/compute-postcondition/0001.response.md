State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `t` is greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.
2. The variable `_` is a dummy variable used as the loop counter, and its initial value is not relevant to the loop's execution condition.
3. The key variable here is `t`, which determines whether the loop will execute. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.
4. Since `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and it is specified that this value is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, we need to ensure that `t` is within this range and greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `t` is greater than 0.
