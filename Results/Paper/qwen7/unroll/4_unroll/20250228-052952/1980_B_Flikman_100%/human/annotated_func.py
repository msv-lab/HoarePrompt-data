#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are positive integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        
        sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
        
        removed_count = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
                removed_count += 1
        
        favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)
        
        if removed_count == favorite_count:
            print('YES')
        elif removed_count == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' based on the conditions evaluated within each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, the program reads an integer `t`, followed by `t` sets of data. Each set includes integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers `a`. The program then checks if the `f`-th element in `a` (considering 0-based indexing) appears exactly `k` times among the top `k` largest elements in `a`. If it does, the output is 'YES'. If the favorite value does not appear at all in the top `k` elements, the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, the output is 'MAYBE'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \), \( f \), and \( k \), along with a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it determines whether the \( f \)-th element in the list \( a \) (0-based index) appears exactly \( k \) times among the top \( k \) largest elements in \( a \). If it does, the function prints 'YES'. If the favorite value does not appear at all in the top \( k \) elements, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
