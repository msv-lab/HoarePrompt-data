State: **`counter` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop condition is `i < n`.
2. Right before the loop, `i` is 0.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `n`.
4. Since `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0.
5. Additionally, `n` is constrained to be between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^5\).
