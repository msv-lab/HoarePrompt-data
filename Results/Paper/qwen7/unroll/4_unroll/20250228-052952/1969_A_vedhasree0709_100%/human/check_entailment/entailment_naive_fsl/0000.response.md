Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of invitations needed for at least 2 friends to come to the party. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where no pair of friends can attend together because their best friends do not receive invitations. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
2 3 4 1
```

The program will output `2`, but according to the problem description, the correct output should be `3`. Hereâ€™s why:

- Friend 1's best friend is 2.
- Friend 2's best friend is 3.
- Friend 3's best friend is 4.
- Friend 4's best friend is 1.

To ensure at least 2 friends attend, Monocarp needs to invite friends 1, 2, and 3. This way, friends 1 and 2 will attend, and friends 2 and 3 will also attend. Inviting only 2 friends would not guarantee that at least 2 friends attend, as the pairs (1,2) and (2,3) cannot both attend if only 2 friends are invited.

The current implementation only checks for a specific condition (when `q == i + 1`) and always prints `2` or `3` without considering all possible scenarios.
