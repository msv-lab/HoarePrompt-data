Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and after executing the loop, if there exists an index \(i\) such that swapping \(l[i]\) and \(l[l[i]-1]\) results in \(l[p-1] = i+1\), the output will be 2; otherwise, the output will be 3.
