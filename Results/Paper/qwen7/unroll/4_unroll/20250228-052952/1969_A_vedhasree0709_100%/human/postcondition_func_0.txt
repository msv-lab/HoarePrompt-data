The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n and p_i ≠ i. For each test case, the function checks if there exists an index `i` where `p[i]` is equal to `i + 1`. If such an index is found, the function prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.
