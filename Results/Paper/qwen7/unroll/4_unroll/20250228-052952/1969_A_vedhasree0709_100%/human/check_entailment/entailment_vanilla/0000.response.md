### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations needed so that at least 2 friends come to the party. A friend comes to the party if both the friend and their best friend (given by `p_i`) receive invitations.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code iterates over the test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list `l` which contains the best friends' indices.
   - It uses two variables `i` and `j` where `i` is used to iterate through the list and `j` is used to check if any pair of friends who are each other's best friends are found.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current friend `i` and their best friend `q` (which is `l[i]`) are each other's best friends (i.e., `q == i + 1`).
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and sets `j` to `1` to break out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found after checking all friends, it prints `3`.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The logic for checking if a pair of friends who are each other's best friends is flawed. The condition `q == i + 1` does not correctly identify pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. Instead, it should check if `q == i` and `i == l[q-1]`.
   - The code assumes that if such a pair is found, only 2 invitations are needed, but this might not be the optimal solution. For example, in the third test case, both friends need to be invited, but the code incorrectly prints `2`.
   - The code does not handle the case where no such pair exists and the minimum number of invitations required is more than 2.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - To find the minimum number of invitations, we need to identify cycles in the best friend relationships. If there is a cycle involving at least 2 friends, we can invite all friends in that cycle with just 2 invitations.
   - If there are multiple cycles, we need to invite friends from different cycles to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. The minimum number of invitations required would be the size of the smallest cycle plus 1 (to cover at least 2 friends).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
