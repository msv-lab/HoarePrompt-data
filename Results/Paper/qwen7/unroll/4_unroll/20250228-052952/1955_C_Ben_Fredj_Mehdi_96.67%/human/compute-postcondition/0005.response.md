Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) indicating the number of subsequent test sub-cases. For each sub-case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \), and a list of \( n \) positive integers \( a \). It then checks specific conditions involving \( n \) and \( k \), and prints one of several possible outputs ('0', '1', '2', '5', '8', '9', '99', '1000', '10000', '199999', or the length of the list \( a \)) based on those conditions. If none of the specific conditions are met, it iterates through the list \( a \) and reduces the durability of pairs of ships until \( k \) becomes zero or negative, then counts and prints the number of ships with zero durability.**
