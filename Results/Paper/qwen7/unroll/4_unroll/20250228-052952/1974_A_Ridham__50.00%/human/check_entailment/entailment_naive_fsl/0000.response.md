Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. Specifically, the calculation of `remaining_cells` and the subsequent logic to determine the number of additional screens required is flawed.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

- For the input `(x, y) = (12, 4)`, the program should calculate the following:
  - `space_x = 12 * 1 = 12`
  - `space_y = 4 * 4 = 16`
  - `total_space = 16 + 12 = 28`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 4 // 2 + 1 = 3` (since 4 is even, this part is correct)
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 3 - 16 = 39 - 16 = 23`
  - Since `space_x = 12` and `remaining_cells = 23`, the program should determine how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 12 cells. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of extra screens needed.

The program logic for calculating `extra_screen` is incorrect. It should ensure that the remaining cells are distributed across the minimum number of screens. The current logic does not correctly handle the distribution of remaining cells.

For instance, in the given example, the program should correctly determine that 2 screens are needed (one for the 4 `2x2` icons and one for the remaining 12 `1x1` icons). However, the current implementation might incorrectly calculate the number of extra screens needed.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
