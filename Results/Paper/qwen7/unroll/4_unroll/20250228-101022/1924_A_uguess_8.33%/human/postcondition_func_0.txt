The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), \( m \), and a string \( s \). For each test case, it checks if the string \( s \) contains at least \( n \) substrings where each substring has exactly \( k \) distinct characters. If such substrings exist, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' followed by a specific string \( ans \) constructed based on the bits set in the variable \( cur \). The final output is a combination of 'YES'/'NO' and the constructed string \( ans \) for each test case.
