Output State: The output state consists of multiple lines where each line represents the output of one iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if the condition `cnt >= n` is met, the line outputs 'YES'. Otherwise, it outputs 'NO' followed by a string `ans` which is constructed based on the values of `k`, `cnt`, and the current bitmask `cur`. The string `ans` includes characters from 'a' to the character at position `k-1`, repeated `cnt` times, then the missing character, and finally 'a' repeated `n-cnt-1` times.
