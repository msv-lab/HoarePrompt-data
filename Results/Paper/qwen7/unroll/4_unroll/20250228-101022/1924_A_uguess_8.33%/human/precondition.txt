t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The string s in each test case consists only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. Additionally, the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
