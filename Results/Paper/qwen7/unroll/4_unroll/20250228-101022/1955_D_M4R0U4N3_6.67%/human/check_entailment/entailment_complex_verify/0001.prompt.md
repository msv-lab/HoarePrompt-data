You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. After executing the loop, ans is an integer representing the number of times the condition `len(done) >= k` was satisfied, and todo, done, and extra are sets that track elements based on their presence in a and b during the iterations. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving integers t, n, m, k, a (a list of n integers), and b (a list of m integers). For each test case, it determines the number of times a specific condition is met during a series of operations on sets todo, done, and extra. Finally, it prints the count of times the condition `len(done) >= k` was satisfied for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The problem requires counting how many subsegments of array `a` of length `m` are "good" based on the criteria given.
2. A subsegment is considered "good" if at least `k` elements in the subsegment can be rearranged to match the elements in array `b`.
3. The solution uses a sliding window approach with sets to track which elements from `b` have been seen in the current window (`done`) and which could potentially replace those seen elements (`extra`).
4. The initial setup checks the first `m` elements of `a` to populate `done` and `extra`.
5. For each subsequent position in `a`, the algorithm updates the sets by removing the element that is sliding out of the window and adding the new element coming into the window.
6. The algorithm checks if the current window has at least `k` elements from `b` and increments the answer accordingly.
7. The logic seems to correctly handle the sliding window and updating of sets to maintain the counts of matching elements.

Given the above steps, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
