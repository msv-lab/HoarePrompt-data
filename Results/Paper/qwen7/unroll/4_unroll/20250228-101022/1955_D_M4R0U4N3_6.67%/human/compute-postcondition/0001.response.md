Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. After executing the loop, for each test case, ans is an integer representing the number of times the condition `len(done) >= k` was satisfied during the iteration. The sets todo, done, and extra are updated according to the loop logic, but their final states are not specified in the output state since they are not required for the final answer. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
