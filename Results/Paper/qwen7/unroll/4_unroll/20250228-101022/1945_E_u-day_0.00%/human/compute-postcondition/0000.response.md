Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and the values of `n` and `k` are the ones returned by `func_1()`**.

This means that the function `func_1()` has been called, which returns two values: `n` and `k`. These values replace the existing `n` and `k` in the initial state, while keeping the precondition that `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array `arr`, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`.
