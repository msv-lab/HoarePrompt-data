Output State: **`low` is 0; `high` is `n - 1`; `pos` is the index in the array `arr` where the value `k` is found, or `-1` if `k` is not present in `arr`; `st` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `st`. This does not affect the values of `low`, `high`, or `pos`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new variable `st` is created and is an empty set.
