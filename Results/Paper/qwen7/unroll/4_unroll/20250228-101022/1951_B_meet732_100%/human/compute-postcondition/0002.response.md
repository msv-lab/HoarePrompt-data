Output State: **`ind` is an empty list, `a` is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `c` is 0, and `x` is the k-th element of the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `c` to 0. The values of `ind`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `ind` is still an empty list, `a` remains a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `c` is now 0, and `x` is still the k-th element of the list `a`.
