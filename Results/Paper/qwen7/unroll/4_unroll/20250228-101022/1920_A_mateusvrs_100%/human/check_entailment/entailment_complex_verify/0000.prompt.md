You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    #This is printed: each element of the list r on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each with a specified number of constraints. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the given constraints and stores these values in a list. Specifically, it finds the maximum value `bx` for constraints of type 1 and the minimum value `ax` for constraints of type 2. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, it appends 0 to the result list. Otherwise, it counts how many values in the set `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts this count from the length of the range `[ax - bx + 1]`, then appends the result to the list. Finally, it prints each element of the result list on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are overlapping constraints that exclude certain values. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```

According to the problem description, the program should output `7` because the valid integers for `k` are `3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`. However, the program incorrectly outputs `0` because it does not properly account for the overlap between the constraints. The program calculates the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the count of excluded values (`cx`), but it does not handle the case where the range `[bx, ax]` includes values that are excluded by `cx`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it correctly identifies and excludes the values specified in `cx` from the range `[bx, ax]`. The current implementation may miss these exclusions, leading to incorrect results.
