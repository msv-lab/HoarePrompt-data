Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `r` is a list containing integers calculated based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration.

The `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement will print each element of the list `r` on a new line due to the `sep='\n'` parameter.

However, the exact values in the list `r` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the form of the output based on the structure of the list.

Output: **each element of the list r on a new line**
