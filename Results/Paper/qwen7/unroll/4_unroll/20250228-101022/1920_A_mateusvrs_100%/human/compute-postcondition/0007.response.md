Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with a specified number of constraints. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the given constraints and stores these values in a list. Specifically, it finds the maximum value `bx` for constraints of type 1 and the minimum value `ax` for constraints of type 2. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, it appends 0 to the result list. Otherwise, it counts how many values in the set `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts this count from the length of the range `[ax - bx + 1]`, then appends the result to the list. Finally, it prints each element of the result list on a new line.**
