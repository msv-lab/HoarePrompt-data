Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `r` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `r`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 500, and `n` remains an integer between 2 and 100, while `r` is initialized as an empty list.
