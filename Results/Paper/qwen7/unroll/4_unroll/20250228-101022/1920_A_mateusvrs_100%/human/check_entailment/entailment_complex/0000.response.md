Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it initializes variables `ax` and `bx` to store the bounds for constraints of type 1 and 2, respectively, and a set `cx` to store values for constraints of type 3.
3. It iterates over the constraints, updating `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` accordingly.
4. After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it appends 0 to the result list because no value can satisfy both bounds.
5. If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in `cx` and appends this value to the result list.
6. The logic for handling constraints and calculating the result is consistent with the problem statement and examples provided.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
