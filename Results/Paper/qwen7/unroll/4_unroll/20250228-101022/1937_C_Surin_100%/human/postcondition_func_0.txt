The function performs a series of queries to determine the relative order of elements in an unknown permutation of numbers from 0 to n-1. It iteratively updates two variables, `v1` and `prev`, based on the responses received from these queries. After completing the iterations, it prints the final values of `prev` and `v1`. The function does not accept any parameters and returns no value.
