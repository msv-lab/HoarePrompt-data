Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints and the provided code signature, the function `func` does not take any parameters and thus does not have any input to process or validate. Since no specific output or behavior is described beyond the function signature, it can be concluded that the function does not perform any action or return any value.
