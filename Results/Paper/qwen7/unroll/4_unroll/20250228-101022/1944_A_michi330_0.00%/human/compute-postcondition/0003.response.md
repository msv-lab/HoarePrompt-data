Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either '1' or 'n - 1', where 'n' and 'k' are integers entered by the user for each iteration of the loop. The number of lines will be equal to the value of `t`. For each line, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the line will contain '1'; otherwise, it will contain 'n - 1'.
