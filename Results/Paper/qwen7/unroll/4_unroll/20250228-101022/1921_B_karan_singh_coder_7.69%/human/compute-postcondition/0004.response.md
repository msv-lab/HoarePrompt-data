Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4), and for each \( t \), it handles a positive integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 10^5), and two binary strings \( s \) and \( f \) of length \( n \). It calculates the minimum number of moves required to transform the initial state represented by string \( s \) to the desired state represented by string \( f \). If the counts of '1's in \( s \) and \( f \) are equal, the output is the count of differing positions if it is non-zero, otherwise 0. If the counts of '1's are different, the output is half the count of differing positions adjusted by the absolute difference in the counts of '1's.**
