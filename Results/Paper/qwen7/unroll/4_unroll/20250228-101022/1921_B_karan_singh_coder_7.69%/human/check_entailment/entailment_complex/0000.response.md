Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` correctly processes each test case by reading the number of boxes (`n`), the initial state of the boxes (`s`), and the desired state of the boxes (`t`).
2. It calculates the number of '1's in both `s` and `t` using `count('1')`.
3. It then iterates through each box to count the number of differing positions between `s` and `t`.
4. Based on whether the counts of '1's in `s` and `t` are equal or not, it computes the minimum number of operations required:
   - If the counts of '1's are equal, the result is the count of differing positions if it is non-zero, otherwise 0.
   - If the counts of '1's are different, the result is calculated as `(cnt - d) // 2 + d`, where `d` is the absolute difference in the counts of '1's.
5. The logic in the function matches the problem statement and the provided examples.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
