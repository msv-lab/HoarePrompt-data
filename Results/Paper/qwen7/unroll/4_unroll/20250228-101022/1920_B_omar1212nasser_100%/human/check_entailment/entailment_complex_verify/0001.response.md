### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, reads `n`, `k`, and `x`.
   - Reads the array `a` and sorts it.
   - Calls `func_2` with the sorted array and prints the result.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that Alice can remove the smallest elements and Bob can negate the largest elements, which aligns with the optimal strategy.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Initializes an empty list `pos` to store possible sums.
   - Calculates the initial sum `s` of the array.
   - Appends the initial sum minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements to `pos`.

2. **Iterative Calculation**:
   - Iterates from 1 to `removals`:
     - Subtracts the current element from `s` and `s2` (sum of the last `negatives` elements).
     - If there are enough elements left, adds the next element to `s2`.
     - Appends the updated `s` minus twice the updated `s2` to `pos`.

3. **Return Maximum Value**:
   - Returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

#### Key Points to Validate:
1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Ensures that the smallest elements are considered for removal and the largest elements are considered for negation.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - Correctly updates the sums by removing elements and adjusting the sum of the last `negatives` elements.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handles edge cases such as when `removals` or `negatives` are equal to `len(elements)`.

#### Annotations and Validation:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The logic in `func_2` correctly simulates the optimal moves for Alice and Bob.
- The final result is the maximum value from the list `pos`, which represents the best possible sum after Alice and Bob make their moves.

### Conclusion
Based on the detailed analysis and the annotations, the program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob make their moves. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
