#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        
        print(product)
        
    #State: After executing the loop for each test case, the output will be a series of lines, each containing the result of the `func_2(k, x, a)` function call for the corresponding test case, where `a` is a sorted list of integers. The number of lines will be equal to the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. Each line represents the product calculated for that specific test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three positive integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `a` and then calls the `func_2(k, x, a)` function to calculate a product based on the sorted list. Finally, it prints the result of `func_2(k, x, a)` for each test case.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, negatives is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and elements is a list of integers representing the array.
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))
    s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        s2 -= elements[-i]
        
        if negatives + i <= len(elements):
            s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * s2)
        
    #State: Output State: `pos` is a list of integers where each element is calculated as `s - 2 * s2` after removing `i` elements from the end of `elements` for `i` ranging from 1 to `removals`. `removals` remains unchanged, `negatives` remains unchanged, `elements` has its last `removals` elements removed, `s` is the sum of the updated `elements` list, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the updated `elements` list.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value among the list `pos`, which is calculated as `s - 2 * s2` for each element after removing the last `removals` elements from `elements`. The variables `removals` and `negatives` remain unchanged, `elements` has its last `removals` elements removed, `s` is the sum of the updated `elements` list, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the updated `elements` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `removals` (an integer), `negatives` (an integer), and `elements` (a list of integers). It calculates a list `pos` where each element is the result of `s - 2 * s2` after removing a certain number of elements from the end of `elements`. Here, `s` is the sum of the updated `elements` list, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the updated `elements` list. After processing, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`. The variables `removals` and `negatives` remain unchanged, while `elements` has its last `removals` elements removed.
