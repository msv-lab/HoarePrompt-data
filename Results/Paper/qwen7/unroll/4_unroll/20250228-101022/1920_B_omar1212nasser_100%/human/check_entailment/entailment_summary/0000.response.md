Reasoning:
1. Let's analyze the problem and the provided functions to ensure they correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
2. The problem involves two steps: Alice removes up to `k` elements, and then Bob multiplies up to `x` elements by -1. The goal is to find the optimal sum of the array after these operations.
3. `func_1()` reads the input and calls `func_2(k, x, a)` after sorting the array `a`.
4. `func_2()` calculates the maximum possible sum after Alice and Bob make their optimal moves. It considers different scenarios of removing elements and then multiplying some of the remaining elements by -1 to minimize the sum further.

Let's break down `func_2()`:
- It initializes `s` as the sum of the entire array.
- It iterates through the process of removing up to `removals` elements from the end of the array and then calculating the new sum `s` and the sum of the last `negatives` elements `s2`.
- It updates `s` and `s2` accordingly and calculates `s - 2 * s2` for each scenario.
- It returns the maximum value from these calculations.

Given the execution summaries, the functions seem to correctly implement the logic:
- `func_1()` sorts the array and passes it to `func_2()`.
- `func_2()` considers all possible ways Alice can remove elements and Bob can negate elements to compute the optimal sum.

Since the functions follow the described logic and the execution summaries match the expected behavior, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
