Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`. The loop will iterate from `1` to `removals + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, the initial value of `i` should be set to `1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `removals`. Therefore, `i` must be within this range.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `i` is set to `1` and that `i` is less than or equal to `removals` at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * s2`.
- `removals` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove.
- `negatives` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1.
- `elements` is a list of integers representing the array.
- `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements`.
- `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.

The relevant variables for the loop are `i` and `removals`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `i` should be set to `1`.
- `i` should be less than or equal to `removals`.

State: **`i` is 1, `removals` must be greater than or equal to 1**
