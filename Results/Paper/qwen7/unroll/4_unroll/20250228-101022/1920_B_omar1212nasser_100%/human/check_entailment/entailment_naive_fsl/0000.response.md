Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not consider the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob when `x` (the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1) is less than the length of the array minus `k` (the number of elements Alice can remove). 

Consider the following test case:
```
6 3 2
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

- Alice can remove at most 3 elements.
- Bob can multiply at most 2 elements by -1.

The optimal strategy here would involve Alice removing the smallest elements first to minimize the impact on the sum, and Bob multiplying the largest elements by -1 to further reduce the sum. However, the current implementation does not fully account for this strategy.

For example, in the above test case, the optimal moves would be:
1. Alice removes 1, 2, 3.
2. Bob multiplies 4 and 5 by -1.

This results in the array becoming `[6]`, and the sum being `6`. However, the current implementation might not yield this result due to its limited approach to handling the removal and negation operations.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases and thus is incorrect.
