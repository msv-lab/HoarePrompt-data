Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and sorts it.
   - Finally, it calls `func_2` with the sorted array and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes three parameters: `removals` (number of elements Alice can remove), `negatives` (number of elements Bob can multiply by -1), and `elements` (the sorted array).
   - It initializes an empty list `pos` to store possible sums.
   - It calculates the initial sum `s` of the array.
   - It appends the initial sum minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements to `pos`.
   - It iterates from 1 to `removals`:
     - In each iteration, it subtracts the current element from `s` and `s2` (sum of the last `negatives` elements).
     - If there are enough elements left, it adds the next element to `s2`.
     - It appends the updated `s` minus twice the updated `s2` to `pos`.
   - It returns the maximum value in `pos`.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorting the array helps in considering the smallest elements for removal and the largest elements for negation, which aligns with the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob.

2. **Calculating Possible Sums**:
   - The function considers different scenarios where Alice removes up to `removals` elements and Bob multiplies up to `negatives` elements by -1.
   - It correctly updates the sums by removing elements and adjusting the sum of the last `negatives` elements.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should remove the smallest elements to minimize the impact on the total sum.
   - Bob should multiply the largest remaining elements by -1 to minimize the sum further.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `removals` or `negatives` are equal to `len(elements)`.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob make their moves.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
