Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Operation Understanding**: The problem allows you to change a subarray to a single value at a cost of \((j - i + 1)\) burles. The goal is to make all elements of the array equal using the minimum cost.

2. **Current Solution Logic**:
   - The code attempts to find the longest segments where elements are already equal and tries to minimize the cost by merging these segments.
   - However, it doesn't fully account for the optimal way to make all elements equal. For instance, it doesn't consider breaking the array into multiple segments and applying operations to make all elements equal.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`, the current solution outputs `6`, but the optimal solution would involve changing the entire array to any one of the values (e.g., changing all to `1`), which costs \(7\) burles (since the entire array has to be changed).

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Identify the minimum and maximum values in the array.
   - Calculate the cost of making all elements equal to the minimum value and the maximum value.
   - The answer should be the minimum of these two costs.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the minimum and maximum values in the array
        min_val = min(a)
        max_val = max(a)
        
        # Calculate the cost to make all elements equal to the minimum value
        cost_min = sum(x != min_val for x in a)
        
        # Calculate the cost to make all elements equal to the maximum value
        cost_max = sum(x != max_val for x in a)
        
        # The answer is the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(cost_min, cost_max))

# Example usage
func()
```

This approach ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.
