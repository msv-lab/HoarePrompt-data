Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where the array has multiple distinct values and the optimal operation involves selecting a subarray that includes the first and last elements of the array. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The program will incorrectly output `3` because it only considers the longest subarray of identical elements starting from the beginning or the end. However, the optimal solution here would be to change the entire array to the most frequent element (which is each element in this case, so changing to any one of them would work), resulting in a cost of `0`.

The program needs to identify the most frequent element in the array and calculate the cost of making all elements equal to this most frequent element. The current implementation does not account for this logic.
