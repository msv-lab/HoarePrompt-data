Reasoning:
1. The given program aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
2. The program iterates over each test case, reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
3. It then calculates the minimum cost to make all elements equal by determining the longest subarray where elements are already the same, thus requiring no operation, or the cost of making the entire array uniform with one operation.
4. The logic inside the loop:
   - Initializes `l` and `r` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - Increments `st` to count the number of consecutive elements starting from the beginning that are the same.
   - Decrements `end` to count the number of consecutive elements from the end that are the same.
   - Calculates `ans` as the length of the array minus the maximum of `st` and `end`, which represents the cost of making the entire array uniform with one operation.
   - If the first and last elements are the same, it adjusts `ans` to ensure it doesn't overestimate the cost.
5. The program prints the calculated `ans` for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly calculates the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.

Correctness: **True**
