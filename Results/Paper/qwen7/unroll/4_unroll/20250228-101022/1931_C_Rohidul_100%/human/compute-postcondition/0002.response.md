Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the array a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. After executing the loop, for each test case, ans is calculated based on the conditions given and printed. The value of ans is determined by the length of the array a, the positions l and r, and the counts st and end.
