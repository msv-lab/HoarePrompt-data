Output State: The output state consists of a series of 'YES', 'NO', and 'MAYBE' based on the comparison between the k-th largest element and the f-th element in the sorted list of integers provided for each test case. For each test case, the values of `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` are read from input, and the program checks if the k-th largest element in the sorted list is greater than, less than, or equal to the f-th element. If the k-th largest element is greater, it prints 'NO'. If it is less, it prints 'YES'. If they are equal, it prints 'YES' unless the k-th element is the second last element in the list and the next element (k+1) is also equal to the f-th element, in which case it prints 'MAYBE'. This process repeats for each test case provided in the input.
