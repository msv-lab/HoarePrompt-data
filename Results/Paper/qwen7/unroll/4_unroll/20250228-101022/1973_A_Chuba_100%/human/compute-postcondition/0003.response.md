Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either '-1' or a non-negative integer. The specific values depend on the inputs provided for each iteration of the loop. Each line corresponds to the result of one iteration, where if the sum of the three integers provided does not yield an odd number when divided by 2, it prints '-1', otherwise, it prints the calculated result.
