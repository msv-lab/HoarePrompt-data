Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. It then checks if the sum of these three integers is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates a result based on the sum and the difference between the largest and smallest integers, and prints this result. The function outputs a series of lines, each containing either `-1` or a non-negative integer, corresponding to the outcome of each test case.**
