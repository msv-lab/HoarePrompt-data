Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the input values `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a` for each test case.
2. **Sorting the Array**: The array `a` is sorted in descending order, which is a crucial step for both Alice and Bob to make their optimal moves.
3. **Alice's Move**: Alice removes at most `k` elements from the array. By sorting the array in descending order, she can remove the smallest elements, maximizing the sum of the remaining elements.
4. **Bob's Move**: Bob multiplies at most `x` elements by `-1`. By sorting the array, Bob can strategically choose the largest elements to negate, minimizing the sum of the remaining elements.
5. **Calculating `ans1` and `ans2`**:
   - `ans1` is initially set to the sum of the sorted array.
   - `ans1` is then adjusted by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements, simulating Bob's move.
   - `ans2` is set to `ans1`.
   - `ans1` is further adjusted by adding the first `k` elements and subtracting twice the corresponding elements from the end of the array, simulating both Alice's and Bob's moves.
6. **Output**: The function prints the maximum value of `ans` for each test case, which is the optimal sum of the array after both players have made their moves.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the function correctly implements the solution to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
