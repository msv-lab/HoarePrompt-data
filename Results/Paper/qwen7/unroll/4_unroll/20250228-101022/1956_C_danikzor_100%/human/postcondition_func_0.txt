The function processes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) and calculates and prints a mathematical expression `(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6)` along with `2 * n`. It then prints two lines for each value of `i` from 1 to `n`, each starting with either 1 or 2, followed by the current value of `i`, and then the numbers from `n` down to 1. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.
