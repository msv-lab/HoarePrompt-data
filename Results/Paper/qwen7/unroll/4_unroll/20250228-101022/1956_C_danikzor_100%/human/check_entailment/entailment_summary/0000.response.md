Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the matrix using at most 2n operations.
2. The given program does not actually perform the required operations on the matrix. Instead, it prints a mathematical expression and a sequence of operations that do not align with the problem's requirements.
3. The printed operations involve setting both \(a_{i, j}\) and \(a_{j, i}\) to permutations of the sequence from \(n\) down to 1 for each row \(i\). However, this approach does not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix.
4. The mathematical expression printed (`n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`) does not seem to be related to the problem's objective of maximizing the sum of the matrix.
5. The program does not handle the input correctly and does not follow the problem's constraints and requirements.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
