Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Matrix Size and Operations**: For each test case, the program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements using the formula \( \frac{n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1)}{6} \) and prints the required number of operations, which is \( 2n \).
3. **Operations Execution**:
   - The program performs `2n` operations, alternating between Type 1 and Type 2 operations.
   - In each operation, it sets the values in the \(i\)-th row or column to a descending sequence from \(n\) to 1.
   - This ensures that the sum of the matrix is maximized because the largest values are placed in the main diagonal and along the rows and columns, contributing to the highest possible sum.

Given the problem constraints and the provided logic, the program correctly implements the solution.

Correctness: **True**
