Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500\).

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. This means that `i` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, `i` must be set to 1.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (which is already given as part of its range constraint).

Given these points, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 (which is already within its given range)

Since `t` is not directly involved in the loop condition and its value does not affect the loop's execution, it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the final state is:
**`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
