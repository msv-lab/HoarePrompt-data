You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. Specifically, it fails to account for the fact that each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the remaining cells after placing these icons must still fit within the constraints of the grid.

For example, consider the following input:
- \( x = 12 \) (number of 1x1 icons)
- \( y = 4 \) (number of 2x2 icons)

According to the problem description, we need to place 4 icons of size 2x2, which will occupy \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) cells. Since each screen has \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) cells, we would need at least 2 screens to accommodate these 16 cells (as 15 cells are not enough).

However, the program calculates the space required as:
\[ \text{space\_x} = x \times 1 = 12 \]
\[ \text{space\_y} = y \times 4 = 16 \]
\[ \text{total\_space} = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Then it calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons:
\[ \text{screen\_require\_for\_y} = \lceil \frac{y}{2} \rceil = \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 \]

It then calculates the remaining cells:
\[ \text{remaining\_cells} = 15 \times 2 - 16 = 14 \]

Since \( 12 \leq 14 \), the program incorrectly concludes that only 2 screens are needed, which is not true because 12 1x1 icons cannot fit into the remaining 14 cells.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the placement of 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
