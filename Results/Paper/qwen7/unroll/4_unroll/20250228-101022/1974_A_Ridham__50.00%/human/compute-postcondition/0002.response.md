Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(n):`. The only variable here is `n`, and the loop counter `_` is typically an underscore, indicating that the value itself is not used within the loop.

2. **Determine the initial state of `n`**: The initial state given is that `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a non-negative integer (since `range(n)` will not produce any values if `n` is negative).

3. **Consider the constraints**: Since `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), this information is not directly relevant to the loop condition but might be useful for understanding the context or potential range of `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**: The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is a non-negative integer. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is a non-negative integer.

Given these considerations, the adjusted state should be:

**State: **`n` must be a non-negative integer**.
