You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9), compares them, and prints either `(x, y)` in descending order if `x > y`, or `(y, x)` in ascending order if `x ≤ y`. After processing all test cases, it concludes with no return value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. According to the problem description, the input starts with an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. However, the provided program reads only a single pair of integers `x` and `y` without looping over all `t` test cases. This means it will only process the first test case and ignore the rest. For example, if the input is:

```
10
1 9
8 4
1 4
3 4
2 0
2 4
6 9
3 3
0 0
9 9
```

The program will only output the result for the first test case:

```
1 9
```

And ignore the remaining nine test cases. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for handling multiple test cases.
