Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where each \(p_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\), \(p_i \neq i\), and all \(p_i\) are distinct.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be initialized to 0 (the starting point of the `range(n)` function).
   - `n` must be within the specified range \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).

Given these points, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
- `i` must be 0.
- `n` must be within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 50 inclusive**.
