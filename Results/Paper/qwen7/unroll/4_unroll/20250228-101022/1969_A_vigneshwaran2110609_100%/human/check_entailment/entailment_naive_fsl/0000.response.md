Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program assumes that there will always be at least one pair of friends who are each other's best friends and thus can be invited with only 2 invitations. However, this is not guaranteed. For example, consider the input:

```
3
1 2 3
```

In this case, no two friends are each other's best friends. Therefore, Monocarp would need to invite all three friends to ensure at least two come to the party. The program incorrectly outputs `2` in this scenario, which is not the correct answer. Thus, the program is incorrect.
