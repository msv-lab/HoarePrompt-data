Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct. The loop prints either 2 or 3 for each iteration based on the condition given, and the output state remains unchanged as the loop does not modify any of the variables outside its scope.

In simpler terms, the loop processes inputs and prints either 2 or 3 for each iteration but does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `p`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
