Reasoning:
- The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` because inviting both of them would ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
- However, the program does not handle the case where no such pair exists correctly. It always prints `3` when it fails to find such a pair, which is incorrect according to the problem statement. The correct answer should be `n` (the total number of friends) because inviting all friends individually would ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.
- The program logic is flawed because it only checks for a single pair of friends who are each other's best friends and stops as soon as it finds one, even though this might not be the optimal solution. It should check all possible pairs and ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party with the minimum number of invitations.

Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. It incorrectly prints `3` in cases where more than 2 friends need to be invited.
