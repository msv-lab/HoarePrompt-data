The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon and `m` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. It returns a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1). Each element `l[x][y]` in this list is set to 1 if there is an edge between vertex `x` and vertex `y` among the `m` chosen vertices, and 0 otherwise. The diagonal elements `l[x][x]` are always 0, indicating that no vertex is connected to itself.
