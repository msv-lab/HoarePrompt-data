Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **First Row and Last Row Check**: The solution checks if the first row and the last row are different and if they contain only one type of color. However, this is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color. For example, consider the following grid:
   ```
   W
   B
   ```
   The first and last rows are different, but it's still possible to make all squares the same color by performing operations.

2. **General Grid Check**: The solution does not check the entire grid to see if it can be made uniform. It should verify if there is a way to make all rows or columns the same color through the allowed operations.

3. **Operations Logic**: The operations allow changing the color of all squares within a subrectangle defined by two points of the same color. This means that the solution needs to ensure that such operations can eventually make all squares the same color.

### Correct Solution:
A correct approach would involve checking if the grid can be reduced to a single color through the allowed operations. One effective method is to check if all rows or all columns can be made the same color.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if all rows are the same
        all_rows_same = all(row == grid[0] for row in grid)
        
        # Check if all columns are the same
        all_cols_same = True
        for col in range(m):
            if any(grid[row][col] != grid[0][col] for row in range(n)):
                all_cols_same = False
                break
        
        if all_rows_same or all_cols_same:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

This solution correctly checks if all rows or all columns are the same, ensuring that the grid can be made uniform through the allowed operations.
