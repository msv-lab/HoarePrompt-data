Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head uses `_` as the loop variable, which is a common convention to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The loop runs for the number of times specified by the input.

2. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: Since the loop runs based on the input, the only thing that needs to be adjusted is the input itself. The loop will execute once for each line of input provided by the user.

3. **Understand the constraints**: The problem states that there are multiple test cases, and each test case consists of inputs `n`, `m`, and a grid of size `n x m`. The number of test cases (`t`) is given such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

4. **Formulate the required state**: For the loop to execute, the input must be provided. Specifically, the loop will run `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

Given these points, the state before the loop should include the fact that `t` test cases need to be processed, and the loop will execute `t` times.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the loop will execute `t` times.**
