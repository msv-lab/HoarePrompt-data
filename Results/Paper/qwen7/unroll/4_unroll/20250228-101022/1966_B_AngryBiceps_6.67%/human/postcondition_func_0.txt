The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of size n x m where n and m are positive integers up to 500. For each test case, it reads the grid and checks if the first row is uniform and different from the last row, or if any row is uniform and different from its corresponding column's start and end characters. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function outputs a series of 'YES' and 'NO' based on these conditions for each test case.
