Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the object `costs`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `h` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `k` is a positive integer.
   - `costs` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the `costs` list. Therefore, the loop will execute if `costs` is a non-empty list.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `costs` is a list with two elements, the loop will definitely execute regardless of the values of `h`, `n`, and `k`. However, we need to ensure that the loop head is correctly set up.
   - The variable `i` will take on the values from the `costs` list during each iteration. Initially, `i` will be set to the first element of `costs`, which is `n - k + 1`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are the ones related to the loop head, specifically `i` and `costs`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n - k + 1`, `costs` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`**
