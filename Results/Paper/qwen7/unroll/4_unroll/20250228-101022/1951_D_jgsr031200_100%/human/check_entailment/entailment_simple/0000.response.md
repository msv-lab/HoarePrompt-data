### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the basic case where `n == k` by printing "YES" and setting up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - For cases where `n < k`, the program correctly prints "NO".
   - For cases where `n >= k`, the program attempts to set up stalls with specific prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Stall Pricing Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` tries to distribute the coins across stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` are chosen to ensure that:
     - In the first stall, Alice spends as much as possible without exceeding `n - k + 1` coins.
     - In the second stall, Alice spends the remaining coins, which should be exactly `1` coin per jewel if `n` is just above `k`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is just slightly more than `k-1`, the first stall will have a price of `1` coin, and Alice will buy 1 jewel, leaving her with `n - (k - 1)` coins. The second stall will then have a price of `1` coin, and Alice will buy the remaining jewels.
   - If `n` is significantly more than `k`, the first stall will have a higher price, and Alice will buy fewer jewels, ensuring she doesn't exceed `k` jewels.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The program prints "YES" and the number of stalls (2 in this case) followed by the prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - The logic ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by carefully choosing the prices and the number of stalls.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up at most 60 stalls with appropriate prices. It handles all edge cases and outputs the correct results as per the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
