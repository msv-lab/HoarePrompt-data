Output State: `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`, `n` is 0.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the `costs` list. The first element of `costs` is `n - k + 1` and the second is `1`. In the first iteration, `curr` is set to `n // (n - k + 1)`, then `h` is incremented by `curr` and `n` is decreased by `(n - k + 1) * curr`. In the second iteration, `curr` is set to `n // 1`, then `h` is incremented by `curr` and `n` is decreased by `1 * curr`. After both iterations, `n` becomes 0.
