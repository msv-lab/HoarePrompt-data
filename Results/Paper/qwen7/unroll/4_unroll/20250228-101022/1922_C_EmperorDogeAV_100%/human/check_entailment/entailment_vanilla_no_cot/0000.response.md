Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution contains several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**: The `func_1` function is designed to determine the direction (forward or backward) to the closest city but does not correctly identify the closest city itself. This function should find the closest city directly rather than determining a direction.

2. **Unnecessary Reversal and Prefix Sum Calculations**: The reversal of the cities list and subsequent prefix sum calculations are unnecessary and complicate the solution. The problem can be solved more straightforwardly without these steps.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Queries**: The logic for handling queries assumes that the prefix sums calculated from `func_1` can be used directly to find the minimum cost, which is not accurate. The solution needs to correctly compute the minimum cost using the actual closest city information.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Find the closest city for each city
    closest_cities = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        min_dist = float('inf')
        closest_city_index = -1
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j:
                dist = abs(cities[i] - cities[j])
                if dist < min_dist:
                    min_dist = dist
                    closest_city_index = j
        closest_cities[i] = closest_city_index + 1  # Adjust index to be 1-based

    m = int(input())
    for _ in range(m):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        a -= 1
        b -= 1
        
        # Calculate the minimum cost to travel from city a to city b
        if a < b:
            # Travel to the closest city first
            cost = 1
            while a != b:
                a = closest_cities[a]
                cost += 1
            print(cost)
        else:
            # Travel to the closest city first
            cost = 1
            while a != b:
                b = closest_cities[b]
                cost += 1
            print(cost)
```

This corrected version directly computes the closest city for each city and uses this information to calculate the minimum cost for each query.
