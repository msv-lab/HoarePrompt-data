Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `m` is the number of queries, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `prog_cities` with `n-1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `cities`, `n`, or `m`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `cities` and `m`, while `prog_cities` is now a list of `n-1` zeros.
