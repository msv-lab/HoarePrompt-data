Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Range of the Loop**: The loop runs from `0` to `n - 2`, as `range(n - 1)` generates values from `0` to `n - 2`.

3. **Initial Value of `i`**: At the start of the loop, `i` should be `0` because the loop starts iterating from `0`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. Since `i` starts at `0` and the loop runs up to `n - 2`, the loop will execute if `n - 1 > 0`, which is always true given that `n` is a positive integer.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i`.

**State:**
**`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, m and prog_cities are not affected by the loop head**.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:
**`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5**.
