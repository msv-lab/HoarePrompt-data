Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the closest city to a given city. The `func_1` function is supposed to determine whether the next city is closer or further away, but it incorrectly calculates the distances and does not properly identify the closest city. This leads to incorrect results for the queries.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output should be:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the provided program will produce incorrect results because it does not correctly identify the closest city for each position. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not handle the logic of determining the closest city correctly, leading to incorrect distances being used in the prefix sums.
