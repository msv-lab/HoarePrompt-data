Reasoning:
1. The provided program seems to be designed to solve the problem correctly. It calculates the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities based on the unique closest city rule.
2. The `func_1` function is supposed to create a list indicating whether the next city is closer or not. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that moving forward will always be closer, which is not true given the problem constraints.
3. The main program logic seems correct after `func_1` is called. It uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate the minimum cost for each query.
4. Given the problem constraints and the provided notes, the main logic should work correctly if `func_1` returns the correct closest city information.

However, the `func_1` function is implemented incorrectly. It should correctly identify the closest city by comparing the distances to the next and previous cities, but it does not do this correctly. Instead, it always sets the value to 1, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the `func_1` function does not correctly identify the closest city, leading to incorrect results for the queries.
