Output State: **`g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, where each element is an empty list, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed.**

The code initializes a list `g` with `n + 1` elements, where each element is an empty list. This list is used to represent an adjacency list for a graph with `n` vertices. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
