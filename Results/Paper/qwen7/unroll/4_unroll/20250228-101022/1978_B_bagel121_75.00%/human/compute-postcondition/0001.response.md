State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` and the loop runs for `range(t)`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
3. The initial state of `t` being an input integer representing the number of test cases does not guarantee that the loop will execute if `t` is less than or equal to 0.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

Hence, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t must be greater than 0`.
