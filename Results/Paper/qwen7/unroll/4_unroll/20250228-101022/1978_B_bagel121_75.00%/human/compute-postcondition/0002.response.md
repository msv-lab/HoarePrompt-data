Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to the result of one test case. For each test case, if `a >= b`, it will print `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints `ans + p2` where `ans` is determined by the formula involving `b`, `k`, and `n`, and `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`. Each line's content depends on the specific values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for that test case.
