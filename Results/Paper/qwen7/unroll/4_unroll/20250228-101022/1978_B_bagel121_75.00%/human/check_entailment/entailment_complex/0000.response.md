Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It checks if `a >= b`. If true, it calculates the profit as `n * a` which is correct because selling all buns at the usual price `a` would yield the maximum profit when `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
4. If `a < b`, it calculates the optimal `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This ensures that `k` is the minimum of the difference between `b` and `a` plus one and the total number of buns `n`. This is correct because `k` should not exceed the number of buns available or the difference between `b` and `a` plus one.
5. It then calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. This is correct because the prices form an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 for each subsequent bun.
6. It also calculates the profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`: `(n - k) * a`. This is correct because these buns are sold at the standard price.
7. Finally, it sums the two parts to get the total profit and prints it, which is the correct approach.

Given the above analysis, the program logic is sound and matches the problem statement.
