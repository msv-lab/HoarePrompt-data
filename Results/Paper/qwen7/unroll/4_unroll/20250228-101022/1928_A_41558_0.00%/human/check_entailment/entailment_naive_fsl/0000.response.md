Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where both dimensions of the rectangle are even. According to the problem, if either dimension is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle. However, the current implementation checks only for the cases where both dimensions are odd and where one dimension is exactly half of the other, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input `2 4`. Both dimensions are even, so Bob can cut the 2x4 rectangle into two 2x2 rectangles and then rearrange them to form a 4x2 rectangle. The program would incorrectly output "NO" for this case, which does not meet the problem requirements.
