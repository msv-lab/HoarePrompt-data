Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.
3. The conditions in the `if-else` statement are designed to determine whether it's possible to form another rectangle:
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, it's not possible to form another rectangle since cutting an odd-sized dimension results in two smaller odd-sized dimensions.
   - If either `a` or `b` is exactly twice the other, it's also not possible to form another rectangle because the only way to cut would result in two identical smaller rectangles, which do not form a new distinct rectangle.
   - Otherwise, it's possible to form another rectangle.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function `func()` matches the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
