### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its behavior based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description:
- Bob needs to determine if he can obtain a different rectangle by cutting the given rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
- Two rectangles are considered the same if they can be rotated to match each other.
- The program should output "YES" if a different rectangle can be formed, and "NO" otherwise.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
- The function processes `n` test cases.
- For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
- It checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If so, it prints "NO".
- It checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other. If so, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

#### Analysis:
1. **Case When Both Dimensions are Odd:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if both dimensions are odd, it is impossible to form a different rectangle by cutting and rearranging. This is correct.

2. **Case When One Dimension is Exactly Half of the Other:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if one dimension is exactly half of the other, it is impossible to form a different rectangle. This is also correct.

3. **Case When Both Dimensions are Even:**
   - The program does not handle this case correctly. According to the problem description, if either dimension is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle. However, the current implementation does not check for this condition.

#### Example:
- Consider the input `2 4`.
  - Both dimensions are even.
  - The program should output "YES" because Bob can cut the 2x4 rectangle into two 2x2 rectangles and rearrange them to form a 4x2 rectangle.
  - However, the program currently outputs "NO".

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the case where both dimensions are even. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
