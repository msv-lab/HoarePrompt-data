Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the input `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This information is not directly relevant to the loop execution but might be useful for context.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute if `n` is at least 1. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.
   - The variable `i` starts from 0 in the `range(n)` function, so we don't need to adjust its initial value; it will be set to 0 when the loop starts executing.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
