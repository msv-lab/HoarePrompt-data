### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several key issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1()` is called with `n` and `k` instead of `n` and `m`. This is a significant error since `k` is not defined in the problem statement and should be `m`.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic inside `func_1()` does not address the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be calculating something related to the square root of `n`.

The provided solution correctly identifies these issues and suggests a corrected program. However, the corrected program still does not fully solve the problem as described. Specifically, it uses a brute-force approach to check every possible pair \((a, b)\) within the given ranges, which is computationally expensive and inefficient for large values of \(n\) and \(m\).

Given the constraints \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), this brute-force approach would be highly inefficient and likely time-out for many test cases. The problem requires a more optimized solution that leverages the properties of the gcd and the given conditions.

### Correct Solution Approach:

A more efficient approach involves leveraging the properties of the gcd and the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). One possible optimized solution involves iterating through potential values of \(b\) and using the properties of gcd to count valid pairs efficiently.

However, the provided corrected program does not implement this optimized solution. Therefore, while the corrected program fixes the immediate issues with the original program, it does not fully meet the requirements of the problem.

### Final Evaluation:

**Final: False**

The original program is incorrect due to the issues identified, and the provided corrected program, while fixing those issues, does not fully solve the problem efficiently.
