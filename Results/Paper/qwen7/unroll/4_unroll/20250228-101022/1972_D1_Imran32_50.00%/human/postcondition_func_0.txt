The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates the value of \( ans \) as \( n + \sum_{i=2}^{\sqrt{n}} \left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor \), and prints the final value of \( ans \). The function does not return any value but prints the calculated result for each test case.
