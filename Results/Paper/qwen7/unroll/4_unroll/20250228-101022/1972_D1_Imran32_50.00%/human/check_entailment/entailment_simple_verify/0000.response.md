### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program defines a function `func_1()` which takes two integers \(n\) and \(k\) as input.
   - It initializes `ans` with `n` and then iterates from 2 to \(\sqrt{n} + 1\).
   - For each \(i\) in this range, it calculates \(cnt = i * i\) and adds \((n + i) // cnt\) to `ans`.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code shows that the program does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the number of valid pairs can be calculated by iterating over a specific range and adding a value to `ans`.

4. **Test Case Example**:
   - Consider the test case \(n = 2\), \(m = 2\).
   - The valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2).
   - The program, however, does not correctly identify these pairs and instead uses a different logic that does not satisfy the required condition.

5. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.
   - The provided logic in the program does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
