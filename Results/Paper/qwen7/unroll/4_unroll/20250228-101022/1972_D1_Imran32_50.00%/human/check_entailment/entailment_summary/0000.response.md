Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function `func_1` Implementation**: The current implementation of `func_1` only handles the case where \(n\) is the upper limit for \(a\) and \(m\) is not considered at all. It also does not calculate the required condition involving \(\gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Calculation Logic**: The current logic inside `func_1` calculates \(ans = n + \sum_{i=2}^{\sqrt{n}} \left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\), which is not related to the problem requirements. This calculation seems to be an attempt to count something related to divisors or multiples, but it is not aligned with the problem statement.

4. **Test Case Output**: The provided example outputs do not match the expected results for the given problem. For instance, the output for the test case \( (10, 8) \) should be 14, but the current implementation would produce a different result.

Given these points, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
