Output State: The value of `t` remains the same as the initial input, and for each iteration from 1 to `t`, the program processes the values of `n` and `k` entered by the user. After processing, it prints a value based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The final output state will consist of `t` printed values, each derived from the respective `n` and `k` inputs.
