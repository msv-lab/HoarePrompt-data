Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and `t` is equal to the integer input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial condition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) remains valid, and now `t` specifically holds the value of the integer input provided by the user.
