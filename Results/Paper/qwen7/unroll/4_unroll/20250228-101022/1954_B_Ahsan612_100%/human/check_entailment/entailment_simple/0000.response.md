Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
3. The logic inside the function aims to find the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same value in the array. This is done by iterating through the array and keeping track of the length of consecutive identical elements (`same`), updating `minn` whenever a different element is encountered.
4. After the loop, `minn` should hold the minimum length of such segments, or `inf` if no such segment exists.
5. The program checks if `minn` is `inf` or equal to the length of the array. If so, it prints `-1`, indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful. Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.
6. The logic seems to follow the problem statement accurately, and the constraints are handled appropriately.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the execution states.

Correctness: **True**
