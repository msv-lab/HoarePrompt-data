### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given array to make it non-beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if it can be made into an array with all identical elements by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The operation involves choosing an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`) such that `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}` and replacing `a_i` with `a_{i-1}`.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of removals needed to break this property. If it's impossible, return `-1`.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes variables to track the current sequence of identical numbers (`same`), the number currently being tracked (`num`), and the minimum length of any sequence of identical numbers found (`minn`).
   - The loop iterates through the array, updating `same` and `minn` as necessary.
   - After processing the array, it checks if `minn` is still `inf` or equals the length of the array, indicating it was never possible to break the beauty condition, and prints `-1` in such cases. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic for tracking sequences of identical numbers seems correct.
   - The approach of finding the minimum length of any sequence of identical numbers is sound, as removing fewer than this length would still leave the array beautiful.
   - The handling of edge cases (like when `minn` remains `inf` or equals the length of the array) is appropriate.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It accurately identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful or returns `-1` if it's impossible.

**Correctness: True**
