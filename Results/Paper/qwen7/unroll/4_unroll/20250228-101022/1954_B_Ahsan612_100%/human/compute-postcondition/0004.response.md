Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n`, followed by a list `ar` of `n` integers. It then finds the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same value in the array `ar`. If such segments exist, it prints the minimum length; otherwise, it prints -1.**
