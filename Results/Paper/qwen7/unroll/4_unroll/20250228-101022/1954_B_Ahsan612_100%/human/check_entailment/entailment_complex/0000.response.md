Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` correctly processes each test case by reading the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
2. It initializes variables to track the current sequence of the same number (`same`), the current number (`num`), and the minimum length of sequences with the same number (`minn`).
3. The while loop iterates through the array, updating the count of consecutive identical elements and resetting when a different element is encountered.
4. After the loop, it checks if any sequence was found (`minn` is not infinity) and if the entire array consists of the same element (`minn` equals `len(ar)`). If neither condition is met, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the minimum length of the sequence.
5. The logic correctly identifies whether the array can be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements or if it is already impossible to do so.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
