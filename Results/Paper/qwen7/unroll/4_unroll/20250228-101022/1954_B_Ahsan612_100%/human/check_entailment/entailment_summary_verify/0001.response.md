### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given array to make it non-beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if it can be made into an array with all identical elements by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The operation involves choosing an index \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq n-1\)) such that \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\) and replacing \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\).
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of removals needed to break this property. If it's impossible, return \(-1\).

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the array itself.
   - It initializes variables to track the current sequence of identical numbers (`same`), the number currently being tracked (`num`), and the minimum length of any sequence of identical numbers found (`minn`).
   - The loop iterates through the array, updating `same` and `minn` as necessary.
   - After processing the array, it checks if `minn` is still `inf` or equals the length of the array, indicating it was never possible to break the beauty condition, and prints `-1` in such cases. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic for tracking sequences of identical numbers seems correct.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic that determines the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition.
   - The code only considers the minimum length of any sequence of identical numbers but does not account for the fact that removing fewer than this length might still leave the array beautiful due to other sequences of identical numbers.

### Example Analysis:
- Consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`.
  - The code correctly identifies that the minimum length of any sequence of identical numbers is `1` (since each number appears only once in a sequence).
  - However, removing just one element (e.g., the second element `2`) does not break the beauty condition because the remaining array `[1, 1, 2, 1]` is still beautiful.
  - The correct answer should be `1`, but the code incorrectly outputs `-1`.

### Correct Approach:
- To determine the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition, we need to consider the longest sequence of identical numbers and ensure that removing fewer than this length does not leave the array beautiful.
- We should also consider the possibility of multiple sequences of identical numbers and their interactions.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It only considers the minimum length of any sequence of identical numbers but fails to account for the interactions between different sequences of identical numbers.

**Final: False**
