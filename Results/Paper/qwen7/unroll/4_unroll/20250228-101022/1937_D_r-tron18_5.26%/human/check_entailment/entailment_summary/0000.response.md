Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_2` accurately calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each query.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a grid of length `n` with characters `<` and `>`.
   - A pinball starts at position `i` and moves based on the direction indicated by the character at that position.
   - After each move, the direction is reversed.
   - The pinball stops when it reaches the boundary of the grid.

2. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - The function initializes some variables and accumulates positions where the direction is `>` into `pre`.
   - It calculates the total number of `>` directions (`totalOne`) and uses `accumulate` to create a prefix sum array `preOne`.
   - For each position `i` from `n-1` to `0`, it checks the direction and updates the answer based on the balance of `>` and `<` directions.
   - It uses `func_1` to compute certain values needed for the calculations.

3. **Key Calculations:**
   - The function correctly handles the reversal of directions and the movement of the pinball.
   - It calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid by considering the balance of `>` and `<` directions.
   - The logic seems to handle both cases where the pinball starts moving towards the boundary and the reversal of directions.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles edge cases such as when the pinball starts at the boundary or when there are no more `>` or `<` directions to reverse.

Given the detailed analysis and the logical flow of the code, the implementation appears to correctly calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

Correctness: **True**
