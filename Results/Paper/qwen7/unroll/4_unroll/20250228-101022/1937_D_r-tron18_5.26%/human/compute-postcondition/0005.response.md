Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to `n - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` is less than 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to a value such that the loop condition holds true initially.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `i` should be set to `n - 1` initially.
   - The variable `n` should be set to a value such that `i` (which starts at `n - 1`) is non-negative when the loop begins.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is a list of length `totalOne` filled with zeros.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the corresponding elements in `pre` with an initial 0 added at the beginning.
- `s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s1` plus one.
- `totalOne` is the number of elements in the list `pre`.
- `suffZero` is `[0]`.

Since the loop condition depends on `i` and `n`, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized correctly. The value of `n` can be derived from `totalOne` because the loop runs from `n - 1` down to 0, and `n` is effectively `totalOne + 1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be `totalOne`.
- `n` should be `totalOne + 1`.

State: **`i` is `totalOne`, `n` is `totalOne + 1`**
