You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

    #
    #To explain in natural language:
    #After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `ans` list will contain values determined by the conditions inside the loop for each character in `s1`. The `preOne` and `pre` lists will be empty because they are being modified and reduced in size within the loop. The `totalOne` variable will be 0 since it is decremented in each iteration of the loop. The `suffZero` list remains unchanged as it is only appended to in the case of the '<' character, which does not occur in the final iterations of the loop.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: [values determined by the conditions inside the loop]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s1` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and an integer `n`. It calculates and returns a list `ans` where each element is determined based on the balance of '<' and '>' in `s1` relative to `n`. The final state of the program includes an output list `ans` containing the calculated values, while internal lists `preOne`, `pre`, and `suffZero` are emptied, and `totalOne` is set to 0.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length \( n \).
   - Each cell contains a character `'<>'` which determines the direction of movement.
   - A pinball starts at a specific cell and moves according to the direction until it leaves the grid.
   - We need to calculate the time taken for a pinball starting from each cell to leave the grid.

2. **Given Code Overview:**
   - The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` seems to be calculating some difference between accumulated values.
   - `func_2` is the main function that calculates the time for each cell.

3. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` is used to calculate differences between accumulated values.
   - However, the logic inside `func_1` is not clear from the context provided. It appears to be a helper function but lacks a clear explanation of its purpose.

4. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` processes the string `s1` and calculates the time for each cell.
   - It uses prefix sums (`pre`) and suffix sums (`suffZero`).
   - It iterates through the string in reverse order and calculates the time for each cell based on the direction and accumulated values.

5. **Key Points to Verify:**
   - The logic of `func_1` should be correct if it is being used appropriately.
   - The overall logic of `func_2` should correctly simulate the pinball movement and calculate the time for each cell.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Prefix and Suffix Sum Initialization:**
   - `pre` is initialized correctly with positions where the direction is `'>` and incremented by 1.
   - `suffZero` is initialized to store suffix sums.

2. **Iterating Through the String:**
   - The loop iterates in reverse order, which is correct for calculating the time taken for each cell.
   - For each cell, it checks the direction and updates the time based on the accumulated values.

3. **Time Calculation Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the time for each cell seems to be correct, considering the directions and accumulated values.
   - The conditions for updating `zeroInd` and `oneInd` appear to handle both directions correctly.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases where the pinball might move out of bounds, which is important for correctness.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, the logic appears to be sound and correctly simulates the pinball movement and time calculation for each cell. There are no apparent logical errors or inconsistencies.

Correctness: **True**
