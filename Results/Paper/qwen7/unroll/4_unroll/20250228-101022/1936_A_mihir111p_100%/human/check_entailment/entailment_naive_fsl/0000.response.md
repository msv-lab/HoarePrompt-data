Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the querying process and the determination of the maximum XOR pair effectively.

1. The program initializes `ans1` to 0 and iterates from 1 to `n-1`, but it calls `func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)` which is not meaningful since both indices are the same. It should instead compare different indices to find a suitable candidate for `ans1`.

2. After finding a potential candidate for `ans1`, the program tries to find another index `mx` that maximizes the bitwise OR operation. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. It should compare `(mx | ans1)` with `(i | ans1)` and update `v` accordingly.

3. The final part of the program attempts to find the maximum XOR pair from the candidates stored in `v`. However, the logic for determining the maximum XOR pair is also incorrect. It should compare the XOR values of the candidates to find the maximum.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required logic and will not find the correct indices for the maximum XOR pair in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
