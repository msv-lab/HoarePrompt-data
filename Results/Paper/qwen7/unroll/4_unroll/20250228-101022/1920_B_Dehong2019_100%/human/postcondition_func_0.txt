The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads positive integers \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. It then calculates and prints the maximum value of \( ans2 \) for each test case based on specific conditions involving the elements of \( a \). Specifically, it first calculates \( ans1 \) as the sum of the elements in \( a \), subtracts twice the first \( x \) elements from \( ans1 \), and then iteratively adjusts \( ans1 \) by adding the first \( k \) elements and subtracting twice the corresponding \( x \)-th elements, updating \( ans2 \) to be the maximum of these values.
