Output State: **`t` is reduced to an input integer, and all other variables (n, k, x, and the array a) are yet to be defined**.

This means that the value of `t` is now set to the integer input provided by the user, while the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a` have not been defined yet. The precondition that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2â‹…10^5 remains valid.
