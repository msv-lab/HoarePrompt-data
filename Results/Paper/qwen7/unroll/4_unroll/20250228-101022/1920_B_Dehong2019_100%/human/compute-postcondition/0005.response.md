Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by arrays n, k, and x which are positive integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n), and an array a consisting of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n). For each test case, it returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters, and returns a result for each test case based on the provided conditions without accepting any parameters directly within its definition.
