### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
   - The maximum sum is achieved when each row and each column is a permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it initializes an \( n \times n \) matrix `mat` where each element \( a_{i, j} \) is set to \( j \). This ensures that the first column of the matrix is a permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
   - It calculates the sum of the matrix as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \). This sum is derived from the fact that the maximum possible sum is achieved when each row and column is a permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
   - It prints the calculated sum and the number of operations required, which is \( 2n \).
   - It performs \( n \) operations of type 1 (permuting rows) and \( n \) operations of type 2 (permuting columns) to achieve the desired permutations.

3. **Verification**:
   - **Sum Calculation**:
     - The sum calculation \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \) is incorrect. The correct sum should be \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} i \times (2i + 1) \).
     - The correct sum is derived from the fact that each element \( a_{i, j} \) in the matrix will eventually contribute to the sum, and the maximum sum is achieved when each row and column is a permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \). The correct sum is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} i \times (2i + 1) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i^2 + i) = 2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} i \).
     - Using the formulas for the sum of squares and the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers, we get:
       \[
       2 \left(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\right) + \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} + \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n+5)}{6}
       \]
   - **Number of Operations**:
     - The number of operations is \( 2n \), which satisfies the constraint.
   - **Operations Performed**:
     - The operations performed ensure that each row and column is a permutation, thus maximizing the sum. However, the specific operations (permuting rows and columns) are not necessary to achieve the maximum sum. A simpler approach would be to directly set each element \( a_{i, j} \) to \( i + j - 1 \), which also achieves the maximum sum without needing \( 2n \) operations.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution is incorrect because the sum calculation is wrong, and the operations performed are unnecessary and do not achieve the maximum sum efficiently.
