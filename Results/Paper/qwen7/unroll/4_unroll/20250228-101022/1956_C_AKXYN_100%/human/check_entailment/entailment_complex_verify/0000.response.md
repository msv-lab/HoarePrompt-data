### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its behavior step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the operations described in the problem statement.

1. **Initialization and Calculation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - It initializes a matrix `mat` where each row is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It calculates a value `res` based on a specific formula: \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i+1)(2i+1) \).
   - It prints `res` and `n << 1`.

2. **Operations:**
   - The program then prints two lines for each row index `i` from `n` down to `1`:
     - The first line starts with '1' followed by the row index `i` and then the sequence of numbers from `1` to `n`.
     - The second line starts with '2' followed by the row index `i` and then the sequence of numbers from `1` to `n`.

Let's break down the operations:

- **Type 1 Operation:** This operation sets the `i`-th row of the matrix to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
- **Type 2 Operation:** This operation sets the `i`-th column of the matrix to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

Given these operations, let's see how the matrix evolves:

- Initially, the matrix `mat` is set to:
  ```
  1 2 3 ... n
  2 3 4 ... n+1
  3 4 5 ... n+2
  ...
  n n+1 n+2 ... 2n-1
  ```

- After performing the Type 1 operations for each row, the matrix becomes:
  ```
  1 2 3 ... n
  1 2 3 ... n
  1 2 3 ... n
  ...
  1 2 3 ... n
  ```

- After performing the Type 2 operations for each column, the matrix becomes:
  ```
  1 1 1 ... 1
  1 2 3 ... n
  1 3 5 ... 2n-1
  ...
  1 n 2n-1 ... 2n-1
  ```

- The sum of the matrix after these operations is:
  ```
  1 + 1 + 1 + ... + 1 (n times) + (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n) + (1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1)) + ... + (1 + n + 2n-1 + ... + 2n-1)
  ```

- Simplifying the sum, we get:
  - The sum of the first row is `n`.
  - The sum of the second row is \(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\).
  - The sum of the third row is \(1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n^2\).
  - And so on...

- The total sum is:
  ```
  n + \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + n^2 + ... + n^2
  ```

- This matches the formula calculated in the program: \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i+1)(2i+1) \).

Thus, the program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum and performs the required operations to achieve it.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was accurate. The program does not correctly implement the operations described in the problem statement, but it achieves the correct result by initializing the matrix in a way that maximizes the sum.

Final: **False**
