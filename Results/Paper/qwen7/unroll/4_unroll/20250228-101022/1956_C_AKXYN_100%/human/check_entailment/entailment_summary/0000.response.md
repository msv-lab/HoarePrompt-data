Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires maximizing the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The solution initializes a matrix `mat` where each row is a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It calculates `res` using a specific formula: \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i+1)(2i+1) \).
   - It prints the result `res` and \( 2n \) (since \( n \leftarrow n \ll 1 \) means \( n \times 2 \)).
   - It then performs \( n \) operations of type 1 and \( n \) operations of type 2, setting each row and column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Verification**:
   - The formula for `res` seems to be derived from the sum of squares of the first \( n \) natural numbers, which is correct for the given problem's requirement.
   - The operations performed ensure that every element in the matrix is set to a unique value from 1 to \( n \), thus maximizing the sum of the matrix.
   - The number of operations is exactly \( 2n \), which satisfies the constraint.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly addresses the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
