Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python function `func()` correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix and performs no more than \(2n\) operations, as required by the problem statement.

Here's a breakdown of the function:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. **Matrix Initialization**: A matrix `mat` of size \(n \times n\) is initialized with values from 1 to \(n\) in each row. This ensures that each row is a permutation of integers from 1 to \(n\).
3. **Calculating Maximum Sum**: The sum of the matrix is calculated using the formula \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1)(2i + 1)\). This formula is derived from the fact that each row and column will contribute optimally when filled with permutations of 1 to \(n\).
4. **Printing Output**: The function prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required, which is \(2n\).
5. **Performing Operations**: For each row and column, it prints two operations:
   - A Type 1 operation that sets the row to a permutation of 1 to \(n\).
   - A Type 2 operation that sets the column to a permutation of 1 to \(n\).

This approach ensures that the matrix is filled optimally with permutations, leading to the maximum possible sum, and it uses exactly \(2n\) operations, which is within the allowed limit.

Given these points, the function is correct according to the problem requirements.
