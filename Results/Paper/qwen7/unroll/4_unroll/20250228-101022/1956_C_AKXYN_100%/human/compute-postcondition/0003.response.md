Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). The sum of n² across all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10⁵. For each test case, the function performs some unspecified operation and returns the result based on the given constraints.**
