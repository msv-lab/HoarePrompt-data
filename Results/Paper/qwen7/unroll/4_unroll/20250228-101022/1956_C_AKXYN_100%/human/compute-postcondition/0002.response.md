Output State: The output consists of multiple lines for each test case. For each test case, it first prints the value of `res` and `n << 1`. Then, it prints two lines for each row index `i` from `n` down to `1`, where each line contains a command followed by a sequence of numbers from `1` to `n`.

In more detail:
- For each test case, the output starts with a line containing the value of `res` and `n << 1`.
- Following that, for each row index `i` from `n` down to `1`, there are two lines:
  - The first line starts with '1' followed by the row index `i` and then the sequence of numbers from `1` to `n`.
  - The second line starts with '2' followed by the row index `i` and then the sequence of numbers from `1` to `n`.

This pattern repeats for each test case provided in the input.
