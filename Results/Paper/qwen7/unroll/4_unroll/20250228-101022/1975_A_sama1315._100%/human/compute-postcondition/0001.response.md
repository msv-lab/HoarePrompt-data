Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is split from the input string.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` are not directly modified by this line of code, but the input is now stored in the variable `data`. The conditions for `t`, `n`, and the range of values for each element in `a` remain unchanged.
