You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Output

    000

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

    #State: t binary strings printed, each string generated by the rules specified in the loop. The last line contains an integer counter value for each string, indicating consecutive matching characters between the processed string and the original string `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two binary strings of length `n` and generates a new binary string based on specific rules. It then prints this new string and a counter value indicating the number of consecutive matching characters between the new string and the first original string `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string is flawed. The program does not ensure that the path chosen always results in the smallest possible string. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Path Construction Logic**: The program tries to construct the lexicographically smallest string by alternating between the two rows (`a` and `b`). However, it does not always choose the smallest character at each step. For example, consider the following input:
   ```
   4
   1101
   1100
   ```
   The program constructs the string `11000`, but the lexicographically smallest string should be `11000` because the first character can be chosen from both rows, and the subsequent characters are determined by the smaller value in each step. The correct lexicographically smallest string in this case is `11000`.

2. **Incorrect Counting of Paths**: The counting logic is also flawed. The program counts paths based on a simplistic comparison without considering all possible valid paths that could yield the lexicographically smallest string. For instance, in the example provided:
   ```
   8
   00100111
   11101101
   ```
   The program outputs `001001101` with a count of `4`, but the correct output should be `001001101` with a count of `2`. The correct paths are:
   - Path 1: `001001101`
   - Path 2: `001001101`

Therefore, the program fails to correctly handle the construction of the lexicographically smallest string and the counting of paths that yield this string.
