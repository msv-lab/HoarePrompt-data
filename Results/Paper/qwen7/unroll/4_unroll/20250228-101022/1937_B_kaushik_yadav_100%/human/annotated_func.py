#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} are provided, where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

    #State: t binary strings printed, each string generated by the rules specified in the loop. The last line contains an integer counter value for each string, indicating consecutive matching characters between the processed string and the original string `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two binary strings of length `n` and generates a new binary string based on specific rules. It then prints this new string and a counter value indicating the number of consecutive matching characters between the new string and the first original string `a`.
