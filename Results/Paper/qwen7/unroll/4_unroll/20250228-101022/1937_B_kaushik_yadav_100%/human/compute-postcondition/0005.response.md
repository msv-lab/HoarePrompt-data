Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases internally. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, two binary strings of length `n`, and returns a value based on the comparison of these strings.**

This means the function iterates over a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. It then compares these strings and returns a value (though the specific return value is not detailed in the given information).
