Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the trace `a` is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n for all i; the string `a` is set to 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `b` is a list of 26 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `b` with 26 elements, each set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, the list `a`, and the string `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
