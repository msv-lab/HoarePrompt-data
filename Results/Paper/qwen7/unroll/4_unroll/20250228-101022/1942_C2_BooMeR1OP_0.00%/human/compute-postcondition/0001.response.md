Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an input integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), y is an input integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, a is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in a list named `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
