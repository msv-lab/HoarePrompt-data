Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables:**
   The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(4 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
   - `x` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5)\).
   - `y` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq y \leq n - x\).
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is \((\text{num} - 1)\) for each \(\text{num}\) in the original list `a`.
   - `present` is a set containing all elements from the list `a` minus one.
   - `ans` is defined as \(x - 2 + \sum(1 \text{ for } i \text{ in range}(x) \text{ if } (\text{a}[i] + 1) \% n \notin \text{present} \text{ and } (\text{a}[i] + 2) \% n \in \text{present})\).
   - `gaps` is an empty list.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `x`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` should be set to 0 initially.
   - `x` must be a valid value within its specified range.

### Adjusted States:
Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` should be set to 0.
- `x` must be a valid value within the range \(2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5)\).

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `x` must be a valid value within the range \(2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5)\)**
