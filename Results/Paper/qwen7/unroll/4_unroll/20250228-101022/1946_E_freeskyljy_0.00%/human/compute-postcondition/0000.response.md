Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, N, M1, M2 are integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and splits them using the `map` function with `int` to convert the input strings to integers. These integers are then assigned to `N`, `M1`, and `M2`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state as a positive integer within the specified range.
