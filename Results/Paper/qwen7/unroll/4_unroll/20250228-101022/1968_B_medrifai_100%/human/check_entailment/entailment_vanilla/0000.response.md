Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths `n` and `m` of strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then reads the strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variables `i` and `j` are initialized to 0, representing the current positions in strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - The variable `c` is initialized to 0, which will store the length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop runs while `j < m` and `i < n`.
   - Inside the loop, it calls the function `func_1(a, b, i, j)` to find the next position in `b` where the character `a[i]` appears.
   - If `func_1` returns a valid index (not `-1`), it updates `j` to the found index plus one, increments `i` and `c` by 1.
   - If `func_1` returns `-1`, the loop breaks, indicating that the remaining part of `a` cannot form a subsequence of `b`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds the index of the next occurrence of `a[i]` starting from position `j` in string `b`.
   - If found, it returns the index relative to `j`. Otherwise, it returns `-1`.

### Verification:

- The logic in the main loop is correct for finding the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
- The function `func_1` correctly identifies the next position of the character in `b` and returns the appropriate index.
- The termination condition of the loop ensures that the loop stops when either `a` or `b` is fully traversed.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the problem description.

**Correctness: **True**
