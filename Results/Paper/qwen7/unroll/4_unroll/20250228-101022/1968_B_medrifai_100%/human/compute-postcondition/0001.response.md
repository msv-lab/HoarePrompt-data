Postcondition: **`index` is the position where `a[i]` is found in the substring of `b` starting from `j`, `a` and `b` are binary strings, `i` is an integer representing the current index in string `a` being considered, and `j` is an integer representing the current index in string `b` being checked for the subsequence. The current value of `index` is not -1.**
