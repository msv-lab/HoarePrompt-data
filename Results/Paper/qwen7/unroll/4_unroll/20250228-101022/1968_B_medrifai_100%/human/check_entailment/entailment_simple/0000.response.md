Reasoning:

1. The main loop iterates through each test case, correctly reading the lengths `n` and `m` of strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
2. It then reads the strings `a` and `b`.
3. Two indices `i` and `j` are initialized to 0, representing the current positions in strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
4. The variable `c` is used to count the number of matching characters at the beginning of `a` that also appear in `b` as a subsequence.
5. The `while` loop continues as long as `j` is less than `m` and `i` is less than `n`. Inside this loop:
   - The function `func_1` is called with parameters `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j`.
   - If `func_1` returns a non-negative value, it means that the character `a[i]` is found in the substring of `b` starting from index `j`. In this case, `j` is updated to `new_j + 1` (where `new_j` is the index found by `func_1`), and both `i` and `c` are incremented.
   - If `func_1` returns `-1`, the loop breaks, indicating that the remaining characters in `a` cannot form a subsequence in `b`.
6. After the loop, the result `c` is printed, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that forms a subsequence in `b`.

The function `func_1` correctly searches for the next character `a[i]` in the substring of `b` starting from index `j`. If found, it returns the correct index; otherwise, it returns `-1`.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results based on the problem statement and examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
