Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^3; `u2vs` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, where u2vs[i] is a list of vertices adjacent to vertex i; `n` is assigned the value of the integer input.**

The code reads an integer value for `n` from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `u2vs` remains unchanged.
