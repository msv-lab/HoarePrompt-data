Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the shortest path distances from vertex 0 to all other vertices, `previous` is a list indicating the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex 0 to each vertex, `n` vertices in the tree, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex by an edge, `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`.**

Explanation: The line `path_ba = [b]` creates a new list `path_ba` and assigns it the value `[b]`. This does not change the values of `a`, `d`, `previous`, `n`, or `u2vs`. The variable `_` remains unchanged as well. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the list `path_ba` which contains the single element `b`.
