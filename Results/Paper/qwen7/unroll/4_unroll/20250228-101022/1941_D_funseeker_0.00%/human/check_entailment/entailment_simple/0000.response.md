### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Parsing:**
   - `func_1()` reads a line from standard input and returns it.
   - `func_2()` calls `func_1()` and returns an integer.
   - `func_3()` calls `func_1()`, splits the returned string, and converts each element to an integer, returning a list of integers.
   - `func_4()` correctly parses the input for each test case, initializes the set `ans` with the initial player `x`, and iterates through the throws to update `ans` based on the direction and distance of each throw.

2. **Set Operations:**
   - For each throw, the program updates the set `ans` by considering both possible directions (`0` for clockwise and `1` for counterclockwise) and updating the player positions using modulo arithmetic.
   - The program handles the case where the direction is unknown (`?`) by including both possible directions in the set.
   - After processing all throws, the program ensures that `0` is replaced with `n` if it is present in the set, which is a correct handling of circular indexing.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball after all throws.
   - It then prints the player numbers in increasing order, ensuring they are unique.

Given the provided code and the problem description, the logic appears to be correct and matches the expected behavior. The program correctly processes the input, updates the set of possible players, and outputs the results as required.

### Correctness:
**True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
