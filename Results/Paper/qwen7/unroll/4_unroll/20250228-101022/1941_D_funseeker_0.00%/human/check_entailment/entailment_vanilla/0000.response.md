### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to track the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws.
   - The ball can be thrown either clockwise (`0`) or counterclockwise (`1`), or the direction might be unknown (`?`).
   - We need to consider all possible directions for each throw and update the set of possible positions accordingly.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** Converts the result of `func_1` to an integer.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):** Converts the result of `func_1` to a list of integers.
   - **Function 4 (`func_4`):**
     - Reads `n`, `m`, and `x` from input.
     - Initializes a set `ans` with the starting position `x`.
     - Iterates `m` times, reading each throw.
     - For each throw, updates the set `ans` to include both possible new positions (clockwise and counterclockwise).
     - If the final position is `0`, it is adjusted to `n` (since indices wrap around).
     - Prints the size of the set and its elements.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise throws.
   - It uses sets to ensure unique positions.
   - It correctly adjusts the final position if it becomes `0`.
   - The code reads and processes input as specified.
   - The output format matches the requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws, considering all possible directions for each throw.

### Correctness:
**True**
