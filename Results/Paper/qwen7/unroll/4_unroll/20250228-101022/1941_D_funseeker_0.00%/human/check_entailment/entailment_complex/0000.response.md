### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling:**
   - `func_1()`: Reads a line from standard input and returns it stripped of trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()`: Calls `func_1()` and returns the integer value.
   - `func_3()`: Calls `func_1()`, splits the resulting string, and converts each element to an integer, returning a list of integers.
   - `func_4()`: Processes the input data for each test case and calculates the possible final positions of the ball.

2. **Function `func_4()` Analysis:**
   - It initializes the set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
   - For each of the `m` throws, it reads the distance `r` and direction `c` from the input.
   - Depending on the direction (`c`), it updates the set `ans` by adding or subtracting the distance `r` modulo `n`.
   - If `0` is in the set `ans`, it replaces `0` with `n`.
   - Finally, it prints the number of elements in `ans` and the elements themselves.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_4()` correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise throws, including the case where the direction is unknown (`?`).
   - The use of modulo `n` ensures that the positions wrap around correctly when the ball moves beyond the last player.
   - The handling of `0` being replaced with `n` is correct because in a circular arrangement, moving `n` steps brings you back to the same position.
   - The final output format matches the requirements of the problem statement.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
