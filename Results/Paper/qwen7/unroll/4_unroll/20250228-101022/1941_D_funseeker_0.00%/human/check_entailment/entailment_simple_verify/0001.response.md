### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to track the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws.
   - The ball can be thrown either clockwise (`0`) or counterclockwise (`1`), or the direction might be unknown (`?`).
   - We need to consider all possible directions for each throw and update the set of possible positions accordingly.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** Converts the result of `func_1` to an integer.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):** Converts the result of `func_1` to a list of integers.
   - **Function 4 (`func_4`):**
     - Reads `n`, `m`, and `x` from input.
     - Initializes a set `ans` with the starting position `x`.
     - Iterates `m` times, reading each throw.
     - For each throw, updates the set `ans` to include both possible new positions (clockwise and counterclockwise).
     - If the final position is `0`, it is adjusted to `n` (since indices wrap around).
     - Prints the size of the set and its elements.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise throws.
   - It uses sets to ensure unique positions.
   - It correctly adjusts the final position if it becomes `0`.
   - The code reads and processes input as specified.
   - The output format matches the requirements.

However, there is a subtle issue in the code that needs to be addressed:

- In the annotated code, it states that if `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` includes `n`. This is incorrect because `0` should not be included in the set `ans` since it represents an invalid position (it would mean the ball is at position `n+1` which is out of bounds).

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Line:** `if (0 in ans) : ans.discard(0); ans.add(n)`
- **Issue:** This line incorrectly adds `n` to the set when `0` is present. Instead, it should simply adjust the set to ensure that the positions are valid (i.e., between `1` and `n`).

### Corrected Code:
```python
if 0 in ans:
    ans.discard(0)
```

### Corrected Annotated Code:
```python
# State: `ans` is a set of integers resulting from applying the operations defined by `c` within the inner loop for `m` iterations, starting with the initial elements in `ans`. Each element in `ans` is updated based on adding or subtracting `r` modulo `n` depending on the value of `c`. The operations are applied repeatedly for each element in `ans` during each iteration of the outer loop.
if 0 in ans:
    ans.discard(0)
# State: `ans` is a set of integers. If `0` is in `ans`, then `0` is removed from `ans`.
print(len(ans))
# This is printed: len(ans) (where len(ans) is the number of elements in the set ans, which could be the original length if 0 is not in ans, or one less than the original length if 0 is in ans)
print(*ans)
# This is printed: the elements of ans in increasing order
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was almost correct but missed the subtle issue with handling the position `0`. By ensuring that `0` is not added to the set and only valid positions are considered, the program will work correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
