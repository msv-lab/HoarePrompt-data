Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but relies on the outputs of `func_1()` and `func_3()`. It processes the distance and direction of each throw provided by `func_1()` and updates the player holding the ball based on the initial player `x` and the number of throws `m`. The function returns a set of all players who have held the ball after `m` throws.**

This means the function `func_4()` indirectly accepts parameters through the functions `func_1()` and `func_3()`. It uses the distance and direction for each throw from `func_1()` to update the player holding the ball and keeps track of all players who have held the ball using a set, which is returned as the final output.
