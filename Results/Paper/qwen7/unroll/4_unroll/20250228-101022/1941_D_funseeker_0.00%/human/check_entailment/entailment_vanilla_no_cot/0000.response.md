Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after \(m\) throws. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are correctly defined to read input from standard input. This is necessary for processing multiple test cases.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - It iterates through each throw, updating the set `ans` based on the possible positions of the ball.
   - For each throw, it checks both clockwise (`0` or `?`) and counterclockwise (`1` or `?`) directions.
   - It ensures that the result is within the bounds of the circle using modulo operation.
   - After processing all throws, it handles the special case where the ball might wrap around to index 0 by adding `n` to it.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of possible players and their indices in sorted order.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program correctly identifies all possible players who could have the ball after the specified throws. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
