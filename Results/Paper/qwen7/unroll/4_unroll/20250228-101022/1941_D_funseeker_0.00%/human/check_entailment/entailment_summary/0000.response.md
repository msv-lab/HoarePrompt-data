Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: Reads a line from standard input and returns it stripped of any trailing whitespace. This is used to read input lines in subsequent functions.
2. **Function `func_2`**: Calls `func_1` and returns an integer. Based on the context, it seems to process the number of test cases.
3. **Function `func_3`**: Calls `func_1` and splits the returned string into integers. This is likely used to parse the input for each test case.
4. **Function `func_4`**: Processes each test case by:
   - Reading the number of players `n`, number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
   - Initializing a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and direction `c`.
   - Updates the set `ans` based on the direction:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the clockwise position `(q + r) % n` to the set.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the counterclockwise position `(q - r) % n` to the set.
   - After processing all throws, it handles the special case where the ball might be at position `0` (which is adjusted to `n`).
   - Prints the number of players who could have the ball and their positions.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the function `func_4` correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws. It correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise movements and accounts for unknown directions.

Correctness: **True**
