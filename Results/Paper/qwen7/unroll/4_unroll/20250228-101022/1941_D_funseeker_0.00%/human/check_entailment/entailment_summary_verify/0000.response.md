### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding and Requirements:**
   - The problem involves determining the possible players who could have the ball after a series of throws.
   - Each throw is represented by a distance and a direction (clockwise or counterclockwise).
   - The program should account for unknown directions marked as '?'.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1()**: Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - **func_2()**: Converts the result of `func_1()` to an integer.
   - **func_3()**: Converts the result of `func_1()` to a list of integers.
   - **func_4()**: This is the main function that processes the input and outputs the results.

3. **Main Function (`func_4()`) Analysis:**
   - The function reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - Depending on the direction (`0` for clockwise, `1` for counterclockwise, and `?` for either), it updates the set `ans` with the new possible positions.
   - If the number `0` appears in the set, it replaces it with `n` to handle circular indexing.
   - Finally, it prints the size of the set and its contents.

4. **Validation Based on Function Summary:**
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_4()`.
   - The function processes each throw and updates the set of possible positions correctly.
   - The handling of unknown directions (`?`) is appropriate.
   - The final step of replacing `0` with `n` ensures correct circular indexing.

5. **Edge Cases and Examples:**
   - The provided examples and the problem description cover various scenarios, including unknown directions and multiple possible outcomes.
   - The program correctly handles these cases without missing any potential scenarios.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after \(m\) throws based on the given constraints. The use of sets and the handling of unknown directions are appropriate and ensure that all possible outcomes are considered.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
