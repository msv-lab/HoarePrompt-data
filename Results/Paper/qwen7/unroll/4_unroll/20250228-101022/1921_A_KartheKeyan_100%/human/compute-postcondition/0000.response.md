Output State: **`n` is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the while loop; `s` is updated in each iteration based on the input `l`; `l` is an input integer in each iteration.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` from input, which represents the number of iterations for the while loop. In each iteration, it reads an integer `l` and calculates `s` based on the formula `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`. This value of `s` is printed, and `n` is decremented by 1. The values of `n`, `s`, and `l` are updated accordingly, but the initial conditions for `x_i` and `y_i` remain unchanged as they are not used in the given code.
