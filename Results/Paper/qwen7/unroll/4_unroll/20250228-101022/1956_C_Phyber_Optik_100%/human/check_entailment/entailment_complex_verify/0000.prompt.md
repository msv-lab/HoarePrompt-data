You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program:

        sum = 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. Additionally, the sum of n² over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10⁵.
def func():

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. For each iteration of the loop, the following operations are performed:
    #
    #1. A new value of `n` is taken as input.
    #2. A variable `sum` is initialized to 1.
    #3. A nested loop calculates `sum` using the formula `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` ranging from 2 to `n`.
    #4. The result of `sum` and `n + n` are printed.
    #5. Another nested loop prints two lines for each value of `j` from 1 to `n`, with the first line containing `1`, `n - j + 1`, and a range of numbers from 1 to `n`, and the second line containing `2`, `n - j + 1`, and the same range of numbers from 1 to `n`.
    #
    #After all iterations of the loop, the final values of `t` and `n` will be the last values provided as input within the loop. The output will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to an iteration of the loop, showing the calculated `sum` and `n + n`, followed by two lines of printed ranges for each value of `j`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). For each test case, it calculates a sum based on the formula `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` ranging from 2 to `n`. It then prints the calculated sum and `n + n`. Additionally, it prints two lines for each value of `j` from 1 to `n`, with the first line containing `1`, `n - j + 1`, and a range of numbers from 1 to `n`, and the second line containing `2`, `n - j + 1`, and the same range of numbers from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs multiple lines of results corresponding to each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. The program attempts to calculate a sum and perform operations, but it does not actually maximize the sum of the matrix as required. Instead, it seems to be calculating a sum based on a formula that does not relate to the operations described.

To maximize the sum of the matrix, we need to fill the matrix with the values 1 to \( n^2 \) in such a way that each row and each column contains these values exactly once. The program should perform \( n \) type 1 operations and \( n \) type 2 operations to achieve this. However, the current implementation does not do this.

Here is an example to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

For \( n = 2 \):

- The correct operations would be:
  - Type 1 operation on row 1: \([1, 2]\)
  - Type 1 operation on row 2: \([2, 1]\)
  - Type 2 operation on column 1: \([1, 2]\)
  - Type 2 operation on column 2: \([2, 1]\)

This would result in the matrix:
```
1 2
2 1
```

The sum of this matrix is \( 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 \).

However, the program outputs:
```
7 4
1 2 1 2
1 1 1 2
2 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```

This results in a matrix:
```
1 2
2 1
```

But the sum is still \( 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 \), which is correct, but the program does not follow the required format of performing exactly 2n operations. More importantly, the program does not demonstrate the ability to maximize the sum as described, and it does not handle the operations as specified in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
