Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. After executing the loop, for each iteration, the following occurs:
- A sum is calculated based on the input `n`.
- The sum and `n + n` are printed.
- Two blocks of lines are printed for each value of `n`, each block containing `n` lines.

The exact values of `sum` and the printed lines depend on the specific input `n` for each iteration. Since the initial state does not specify particular values for `t` and `n`, the output state will reflect the general structure described above.
