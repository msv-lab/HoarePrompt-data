### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem requirements step-by-step:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to maximize the sum of the matrix \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{i,j} \).
   - We can perform up to 2n operations, where each operation is either a type 1 operation (permuting rows) or a type 2 operation (permuting columns).
   - The goal is to fill the matrix with the values 1 to \( n^2 \) such that each row and each column contains these values exactly once.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It then calculates a sum using a formula `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for \( i \) ranging from 2 to \( n \). This calculation does not seem to be related to the problem requirements.
   - The program prints the calculated sum and \( n + n \) (which is \( 2n \)).
   - It then performs \( n \) type 1 operations and \( n \) type 2 operations, each setting the entire row or column to the range of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The program does not correctly calculate the sum of the matrix. The sum calculation is irrelevant and does not contribute to the solution.
   - The program performs \( n \) type 1 operations and \( n \) type 2 operations, which is correct in terms of the number of operations allowed. However, the operations themselves do not fill the matrix with the values 1 to \( n^2 \) in a manner that maximizes the sum.
   - The operations performed are simply setting each row and column to the sequence 1 to \( n \), which is one possible way to fill the matrix but not necessarily the optimal way to maximize the sum.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It does not maximize the sum of the matrix and does not follow the required operations to achieve the desired outcome.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
