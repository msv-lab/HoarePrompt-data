Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each iteration of the loop, n and m are integers, s is a string consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', hmp is a counter object containing the count of each character in s, and ans is an integer calculated based on the counts of characters in s and the value of m. After all iterations, ans is the sum of additional occurrences of each character required to make the count of each character in s equal to m.
