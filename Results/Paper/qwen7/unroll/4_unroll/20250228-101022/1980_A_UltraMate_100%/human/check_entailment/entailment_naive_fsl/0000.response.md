Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the required number of problems for a specific difficulty level is less than the number available in the bank. Specifically, the program incorrectly increments `ans` by `m - hmp[i]` for each difficulty level that is missing, which will always result in an overestimation of the number of problems needed.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
9 1
BBCDEFFGG
```

The program will output `1`, but the correct answer should be `0` because there are already enough problems ('B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G') to cover the required rounds without needing to create any new problems.

The correct approach would be to check if the count of each difficulty level in the bank is sufficient for the required rounds. If not, only then increment `ans` by the difference. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        for i in p:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program only increments `ans` when the count of a difficulty level in the bank is less than the required number of rounds, thus providing the correct minimum number of problems needed.
