Reasoning:

The provided program aims to calculate the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that he can conduct \( m \) rounds, each requiring at least one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). The logic in the program seems sound:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Counting Problems**: It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the input string.
3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed**:
   - For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', it checks if the current count is less than \( m \).
   - If the count is less than \( m \), it adds the difference (`m - count`) to the answer, which represents the number of additional problems needed for that difficulty level.
4. **Summing Up**: The total number of additional problems needed is accumulated and printed for each test case.

Given the execution summary and the provided example, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
