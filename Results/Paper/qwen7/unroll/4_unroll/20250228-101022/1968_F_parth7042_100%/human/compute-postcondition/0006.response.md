Output State: **index is 6, t is an integer value from data[0], results is a list containing strings 'YES' or 'NO'.** 

Explanation: The loop iterates based on the value of `t`, which is an integer from `data[0]`. For each iteration, `index` is incremented by 2, and the loop processes the next pair of values from `data`. After processing all pairs, `index` will be incremented by `2 * t`. Since `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, and assuming `t` is at least 1, `index` will be incremented by at least 2. However, without specific values for `t` and the data, we can only say that `index` will be `2 + 2 * t`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the `results` list is populated with 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions inside the loop, but its exact content cannot be determined without the actual data.
