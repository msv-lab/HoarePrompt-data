Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, and a new variable `data` is created, which is a list of strings resulting from the split operation. The values of `n` and `q`, and the array `a`, are not yet defined and thus remain in their initial unspecified state.
