Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It reads the input and processes each test case.
2. For each query, it calculates the prefix XOR values and stores them in `pf`.
3. It uses a dictionary `mp` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
4. For each query, it checks if the XOR of the subarray is zero, which would mean the subarray is interesting.
5. If the XOR is not zero, it checks if there exists a valid split point within the subarray using binary search (`bisect_left`).

The program handles all the necessary cases and examples provided in the problem description. It correctly identifies whether a subarray is interesting by ensuring that the XOR of elements in each part is equal. There are no apparent edge cases or logical flaws in the provided code that would cause it to fail for any input within the specified constraints.
