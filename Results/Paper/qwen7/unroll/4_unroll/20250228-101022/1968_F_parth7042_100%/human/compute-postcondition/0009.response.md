Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array `a` of integers, the size of the array `n`, and the number of queries `q`. For each query defined by indices `l` and `r`, the function determines if there exists a subarray within `a[l:r+1]` whose bitwise XOR is zero. If such a subarray exists, the result for that query is 'YES'; otherwise, it is 'NO'. The function collects all these results and prints them out.**
