Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value from `data[index]` to `t`. Since `index` was initially 0, `t` is now set to the integer value of `data[0]`. The value of `index` is incremented by 1 because we accessed `data[index]`, moving to the next element in the list. The list `data` remains unchanged except for the fact that `t` is now an integer derived from its first element.
