Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an array `a` of length `n` with each element being an integer within the range [0, 2^30), along with two integers `n` and `q` indicating the size of the array and the number of queries respectively. For each query defined by `l` and `r` (where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n), the function does not return a value but likely performs some operation or processing.**

Note: The actual operations or processing within the function are not described here as per the given instructions.
