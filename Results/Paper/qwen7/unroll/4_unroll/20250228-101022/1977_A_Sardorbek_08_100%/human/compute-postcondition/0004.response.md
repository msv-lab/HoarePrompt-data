Functionality: **The function processes a series of pairs of positive integers \(b\) and \(c\) (where \(1 \leq b, c \leq 100\)) based on a given count \(t\) (where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)). For each pair, it prints 'YES' if \(b\) equals \(c\), 'NO' if \(b\) is less than \(c\), 'Yes' if both \(b\) and \(c\) have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise. The function does not return any value.**
