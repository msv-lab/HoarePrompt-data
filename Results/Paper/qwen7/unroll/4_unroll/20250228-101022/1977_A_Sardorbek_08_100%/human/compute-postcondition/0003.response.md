Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two positive integers n and m within the range 1 to 100, along with a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). It does not return any value explicitly from the given information.**

However, since the problem statement does not specify what the function should do with these parameters, the functionality description focuses on the constraints and the nature of the parameters without inferring any specific operations or outputs.
