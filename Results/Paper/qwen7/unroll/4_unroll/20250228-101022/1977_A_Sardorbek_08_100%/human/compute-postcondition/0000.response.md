Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, a is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `a`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and still satisfies the condition `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`.
