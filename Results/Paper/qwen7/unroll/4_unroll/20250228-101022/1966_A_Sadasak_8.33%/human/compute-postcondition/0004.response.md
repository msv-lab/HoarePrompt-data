Output State: **The program returns the dictionary `frequency_table` which contains each number from the list `arr` as a key, and the maximum occurrence of that number up to `k` as its value. If any number's occurrence exceeds `k`, it is capped at `k`. All other keys not present in `arr` remain absent from the dictionary.**

This means that the program will return a dictionary where each key is a unique number from the list `arr`, and the corresponding value is the highest frequency of that number found in the list, but not exceeding `k`. Any numbers from `arr` that do not appear in the list will not be included in the dictionary.
