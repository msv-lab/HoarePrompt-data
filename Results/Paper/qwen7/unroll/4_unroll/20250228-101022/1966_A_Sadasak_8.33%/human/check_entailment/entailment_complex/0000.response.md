Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of cards remaining after performing the specified operations any number of times. The operations allow exchanging k cards of the same number for k-1 new cards.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If \( k > n \), we cannot perform any exchanges, so the answer is \( n \).
   - If \( k = n \), we can exchange all cards for \( k-1 \) new cards, so the answer is \( k-1 \).
   - Otherwise, we need to consider the frequency of each number in the cards and ensure that no number's count exceeds \( k \).

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly handles the base cases where \( k > n \) and \( k = n \).
   - The function `func_1` is defined to compute the frequency table, ensuring that no number's count exceeds \( k \).
   - The main logic checks if \( k \) is in the values of the frequency table. If it is, it prints \( k-1 \); otherwise, it prints \( n \).

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly computes the frequency table, ensuring that no number's count exceeds \( k \).
   - The returned dictionary `frequency_table` is used to determine the minimum number of cards remaining.

5. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic correctly uses the frequency table to determine the minimum number of cards remaining.
   - The conditions and logic flow are consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
