### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Checks:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - It checks if `k > n` and handles this edge case by printing `n`.
   - If `k == n`, it prints `k - 1`, which is correct since no operations can be performed.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly calculates the frequency of each number in the list, ensuring that no frequency exceeds `k`.
   - This function returns a dictionary where each key is a number from the list `arr`, and its value is the maximum occurrence of that number up to `k`.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - After obtaining the frequency table, the program checks if `k` is present as a value in the frequency table.
   - If `k` is present, it prints `k - 1`, indicating that we can reduce the count of some numbers to `k - 1` by performing the operations.
   - If `k` is not present, it prints `n`, meaning no operations can reduce the number of cards further.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when `k > n` and when `k == n`.
   - The logic for checking the presence of `k` in the frequency table and printing `k - 1` if present is sound.

### Conclusion:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and performs the necessary calculations to determine the minimum number of cards remaining after performing the allowed operations.

### Correctness:
**True**
