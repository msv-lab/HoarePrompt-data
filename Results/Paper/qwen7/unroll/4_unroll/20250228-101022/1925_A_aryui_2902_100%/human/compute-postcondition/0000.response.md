Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 676, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged, so it still holds an integer value within the range 1 to 676. The values of `n` and `k` are now set to the integers input by the user.
