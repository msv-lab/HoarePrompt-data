### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to check if we can adjust the radii of the disks so that:
     - Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent.
     - No two disks overlap.
     - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - The problem can be modeled using a graph where each disk is a node, and an edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding disks are tangent. The goal is to find a way to decrease the radii of some disks while keeping the tangency conditions and ensuring no overlap.

3. **DFS and Coefficients**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore the graph and calculate coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) for each node.
   - `coef0` and `coef1` represent linear combinations of the original radii and the new radii, respectively.
   - If the sum of `coef1` for a connected component is non-zero, it means we can decrease the sum of radii in that component.

4. **Checking Conditions**:
   - For each disk, if it hasn't been visited, we start a DFS from that disk.
   - During DFS, we update the coefficients based on the tangency condition.
   - After exploring all connected components, if any component has a non-zero sum of `coef1`, it means we can decrease the total radius of that component.

5. **Output**:
   - If any connected component allows a reduction in the sum of radii, we print "YES".
   - Otherwise, we print "NO".

6. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly initializes the necessary variables and processes the input.
   - The `dfs` function correctly updates the coefficients based on the tangency condition.
   - The main logic checks if any connected component allows a reduction in the sum of radii.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initialization**:
  - The code initializes arrays `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1`.
  - It reads the input and populates these arrays.

- **DFS Function**:
  - The `dfs` function correctly marks the current node as visited and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` values for nodes that are tangent to the current node.
  - The function recursively visits all nodes that are tangent to the current node.

- **Main Logic**:
  - The main function iterates over all nodes and starts a DFS from unvisited nodes.
  - It calculates the sum of `coef1` for each connected component.
  - If any connected component has a non-zero sum of `coef1`, it sets `ok` to `True`.

- **Output**:
  - Based on the value of `ok`, it prints "YES" or "NO".

### Verification Against Examples:

- **First Sample**:
  - The code correctly identifies that the radii can be adjusted to meet the conditions.
  - The output is "YES".

- **Second Sample**:
  - The code correctly identifies that the radii cannot be adjusted to meet the conditions.
  - The output is "NO".

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem. The DFS approach and the coefficient calculations ensure that the tangency conditions are maintained and the sum of radii can be reduced if possible.
