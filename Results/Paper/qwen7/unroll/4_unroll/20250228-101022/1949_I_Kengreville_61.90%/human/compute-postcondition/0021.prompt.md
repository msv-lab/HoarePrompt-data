You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and for each i in range(n), x[i], y[i] are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x[i], y[i] ≤ 10^9, and r[i] is an integer such that 1 ≤ r[i] ≤ 10^9.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: Output State: `nodes` is an empty list, `coef0` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `visited` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`.
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
        
    #State: Output State: `nodes` is an empty list, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where each element is `0` if the corresponding node was not visited or `0` otherwise, `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `visited` is a list of length `n` where each element is `True` if the corresponding node was visited or `False` otherwise, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where each element is `1` if the corresponding node was visited or `None` otherwise, `ok` is `True` if at least one node had `coef1` equal to `1` and `c1` not equal to `0` during any iteration of the loop, otherwise `False`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `nodes` is an empty list, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where each element is `0` if the corresponding node was not visited or `0` otherwise, `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `visited` is a list of length `n` where each element is `True` if the corresponding node was visited or `False` otherwise, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where each element is `1` if the corresponding node was visited or `None` otherwise, `ok` remains unchanged (it is `True` if at least one node had `coef1` equal to `1` and `c1` not equal to `0` during any iteration of the loop, otherwise `False`).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies an external list structure where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and for each i in range(n), x[i], y[i] are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x[i], y[i] ≤ 10^9, and r[i] is an integer such that 1 ≤ r[i] ≤ 10^9. The function does not return any value explicitly but operates on the provided lists and integers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
