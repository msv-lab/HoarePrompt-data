Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function reads the input and initializes necessary variables.
   - It iterates over each disk and performs a DFS to check if the conditions can be met.
   - The DFS function (`dfs()`) is used to traverse connected components (disks that are tangent to each other).
   - Coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to keep track of the relationships between the disks.
   - The function checks if any component can satisfy the condition that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency.

2. **Function `dfs()`**:
   - This function performs a depth-first search starting from a given disk.
   - It updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists for disks that are tangent to the current disk.
   - The `coef0` list keeps track of the sum of radii contributions, and `coef1` indicates if a disk is part of the solution.

3. **Verification**:
   - The core logic of the program is to identify connected components of disks (using DFS) and then check if these components can be modified to decrease the total radius while maintaining tangency.
   - The program correctly identifies if it's possible to decrease the sum of radii by ensuring that the tangency conditions are maintained.
   - The output is determined based on whether any component can achieve the required condition.

Given the problem statement and the provided code, the logic implemented in both functions appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The DFS approach ensures that all connected components are checked, and the conditions for decreasing the sum of radii are properly evaluated.

Correctness: **True**
