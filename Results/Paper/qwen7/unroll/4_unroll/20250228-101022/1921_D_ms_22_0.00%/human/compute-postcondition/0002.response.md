Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t > 0`.

3. **Analyze the initial state**: Before the loop, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and this value is guaranteed to be an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.

4. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**: Since `t` is initialized to a value between 1 and 100, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, the loop will definitely execute at least once.

Given that the loop will certainly execute at least once, no adjustments are necessary to the state before the loop.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive**
