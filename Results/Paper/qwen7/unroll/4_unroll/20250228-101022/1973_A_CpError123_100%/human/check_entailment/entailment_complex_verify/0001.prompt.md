You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        
        y = a + b
        
        print(min(x, y))
        
    #State: Output State: t is the number of iterations that completed, and for each iteration, either -1 or the minimum value of (a+b+c)//2 and (a+b) was printed based on the given conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `t` and `t` test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum value between half of the sum `(a + b + c) // 2` and the sum of `a` and `b` (`a + b`). It then prints this minimum value for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Score Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is even. This is necessary because the total points distributed must be even (since each game results in either 2 points being awarded or 2 points being split between two players).
3. **Total Points Calculation**: The program calculates the total points `x` by dividing the sum of the scores by 2. This value represents the total points that should be distributed among the players if there were no draws.
4. **Points from Wins and Draws**: The program calculates `y` as the sum of the points of the first two players `a + b`. This value represents the points that would be distributed if all games resulted in wins and losses.
5. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y`, which effectively gives the maximum number of draws possible. This is because:
   - `x` represents the total points that need to be distributed.
   - `y` represents the points that can be distributed without any draws (i.e., all wins and losses).

However, there is a flaw in the logic for calculating the maximum number of draws. The program does not account for the possibility that the scores might not be achievable through a valid sequence of games and results. Specifically, the program does not check if the scores are consistent with the constraints of the game.

### Example Analysis:

- **Case 1**: `0 0 0`
  - Total points: \(0 + 0 + 0 = 0\) (even)
  - \(x = 0\), \(y = 0\)
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Case 2**: `0 1 1`
  - Total points: \(0 + 1 + 1 = 2\) (even)
  - \(x = 1\), \(y = 1\)
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Case 3**: `1 1 1`
  - Total points: \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\) (odd)
  - Output: `-1` (Correct)

- **Case 4**: `1 1 2`
  - Total points: \(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\) (even)
  - \(x = 2\), \(y = 2\)
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Case 5**: `3 3 3`
  - Total points: \(3 + 3 + 3 = 9\) (odd)
  - Output: `-1` (Correct)

- **Case 6**: `3 4 5`
  - Total points: \(3 + 4 + 5 = 12\) (even)
  - \(x = 6\), \(y = 7\)
  - Output: `6` (Incorrect, should be `-1`)

- **Case 7**: `1 1 10`
  - Total points: \(1 + 1 + 10 = 12\) (even)
  - \(x = 6\), \(y = 2\)
  - Output: `2` (Incorrect, should be `-1`)

### Conclusion:

The program fails to correctly handle cases where the scores are inconsistent with the game rules. Therefore, the given program is not fully correct.
