Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, followed by lists `a` and `b`. This part matches the problem statement.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates a new list `c` where each element is the minimum between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This step is correct according to the problem statement.
   - It then computes a suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of elements from index `i` to `n-1` in `c`. This is done correctly using a reverse loop.

3. **Minimum Cost Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to infinity and iterates through the first `k` positions to find the minimum cost required for Kirill to move to one of these positions. For each position `i`, it calculates the cost as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` and updates `ans` accordingly. This logic is also correct.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is the expected output format.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
