You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of integers, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\).
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `res` is the count of unique numbers in the list `a` after applying the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`, and `count` is a dictionary where each key is a transformed version of the numbers in `a` and the value is the difference between the initial count of that transformed number and the count after applying the operation.
    return res
    #The program returns the count of unique numbers in the list 'a' after applying the bitwise operation num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, stored in 'res'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers, applies the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each element in `a`, and returns the count of unique numbers in the modified list.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the count of unique numbers in the list 'a' after applying the bitwise operation num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, stored in 'res'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
