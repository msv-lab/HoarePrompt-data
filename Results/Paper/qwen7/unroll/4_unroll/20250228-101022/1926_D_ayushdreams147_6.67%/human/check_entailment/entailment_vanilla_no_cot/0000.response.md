Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` attempts to use bitwise operations to categorize the numbers into groups, but it does not ensure that the condition \(x_2(i) \neq y_2(i)\) for all \(1 \leq i < 32\) is met for any two numbers in the same group. 

To solve this problem correctly, you should consider the 31 least significant bits of each number and use these bits to determine which group a number belongs to. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Create a dictionary to store the groups
    groups = [set() for _ in range(2**31)]
    
    for num in a:
        # Use the 31 least significant bits to determine the group
        key = num & ((1 << 31) - 1)
        groups[key].add(num)
    
    # The number of groups needed is the length of the longest set in the groups list
    max_group_size = max(len(group) for group in groups)
    print(max_group_size)
```

This corrected program ensures that each number is placed in a group based on its 31 least significant bits, and the result is the maximum size of any group, which represents the minimum number of groups needed.
