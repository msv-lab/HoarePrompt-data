Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5), and two binary strings a and b (lengths n and m respectively). For each test case, it finds the position k in string b where a substring of a matches a subsequence of b, and prints the final value of k for each test case. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.**
