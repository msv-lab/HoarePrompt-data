Output State: t is a positive integer between 1 and 500, s is a binary string with a length between 1 and 500, and after executing the loop, for each input string s, if no two consecutive characters are different (i.e., s is either "000...0" or "111...1"), the output is the length of s plus one; otherwise, the output is the number of positions where consecutive characters differ.
