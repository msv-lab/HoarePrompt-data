Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program attempts to find the maximum score by adjusting the values of the cards, but it does not ensure that the final arrangement of cards will form the required contiguous subarrays of length \( n \) that are permutations of \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).

For instance, consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
1
3 4
6 1 8
```

- Expected Output:
```
22
```

However, the program outputs:
```
15
```

This happens because the program does not correctly calculate the maximum score by ensuring that the final arrangement of cards forms the required subarrays. The program's logic for adjusting the values and calculating the score is flawed, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
