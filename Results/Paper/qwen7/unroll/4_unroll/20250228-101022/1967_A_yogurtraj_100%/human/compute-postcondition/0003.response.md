Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a set of inputs including an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100), followed by t test cases. Each test case includes two integers n and k (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}), and a list a containing n integers (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}). For each test case, the function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with specific parameters, and returns a result for each test case based on the provided inputs.
