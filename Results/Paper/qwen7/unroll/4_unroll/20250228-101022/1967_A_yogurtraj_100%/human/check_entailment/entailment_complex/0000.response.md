Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list `a`. This matches the problem statement.

2. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted, which is necessary to determine the minimum adjustments needed to reach the desired configuration.

3. **Adjustment Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list `a` to find the point where the remaining budget `k` cannot afford the difference between consecutive elements anymore.
   - It calculates the required adjustments (`r`, `rem`, `y`) based on the remaining budget and the number of increments needed.
   - If there is still remaining budget after the loop, it adjusts the last element accordingly.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final value is calculated using the adjusted maximum value `r`, the remainder `rem`, and the count of adjusted elements `y`.
   - The formula `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` is used to compute the maximum score, which aligns with the problem's requirement to count the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the computed value for each test case, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given that the logic and calculations match the problem statement and the provided examples, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
