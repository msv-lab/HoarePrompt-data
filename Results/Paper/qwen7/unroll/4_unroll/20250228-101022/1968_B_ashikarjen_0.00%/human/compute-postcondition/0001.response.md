Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; n is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input; a is the string obtained from the input.**

The code `a = input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. Since `t` and `n` are not affected by this operation, their states remain unchanged. Variable `a` is assigned the entire input as a string.
