Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input; `b` is a string obtained from the input; `k` is 0.**

The code initializes `k` to 0. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state, and `b` also remains unchanged.
