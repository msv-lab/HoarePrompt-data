Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input; `b` is a string obtained from the input; `k` is 0; `j` is 0.**

The code initializes `j` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `b`, or `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
