### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the input values `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`. This ensures that `n` and `m` are integers representing the lengths of the binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively.

2. **String Initialization**: The binary strings `a` and `b` are correctly initialized by reading the next two lines of input.

3. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `k` and `j` are initialized to 0. `k` will store the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`, and `j` will be used to traverse through `b`.

4. **Loop Through String `a`**:
   - The loop iterates through each character of `a` using `i` as the index.
   - Inside the loop, there is a `while` loop that tries to find the current character `a[i]` in `b` starting from the current position `j`.
   - If the character `a[i]` is found in `b` at position `j`, `k` is incremented, and `j` is moved to the next position in `b`.
   - If the character `a[i]` is not found, the loop breaks, indicating that the remaining part of `a` cannot form a subsequence of `b`.

5. **Output**: The function prints the value of `k`, which is the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that forms a subsequence of `b`.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, this implementation correctly determines the maximum possible number `k` such that a prefix of string `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of string `b`.

### Correctness:

**True**
