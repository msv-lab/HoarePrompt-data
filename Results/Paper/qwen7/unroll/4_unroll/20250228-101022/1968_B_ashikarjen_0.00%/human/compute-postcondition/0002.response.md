Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input; `b` is a string obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `b = input()` reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `b`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
