Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n):`. The objects involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - The variable `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input.
   - `b` is a string obtained from the input.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `j` is 0.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, we need to set `i` to 0.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
