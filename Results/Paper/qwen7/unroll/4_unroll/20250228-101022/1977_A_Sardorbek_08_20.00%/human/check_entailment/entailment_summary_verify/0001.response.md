### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the problem description step by step to ensure the correctness of the original assessment.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then processes each test case.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It stores these values in a tuple `q = (b, c)`.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if `b` (number of moves) is equal to `c` (desired number of cubes).
     - If `b == c`, it prints 'YES'. This is correct because Nikita can simply add one cube per move to end up with `c` cubes.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because it's impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves allows.
   - If `b` is greater than `c`, it further checks if `b % 2 == c % 2`.
     - If this condition is true, it prints 'Yes'. This is incorrect because the condition should be `b - c` being even, not just `b % 2 == c % 2`. For example, if `b = 5` and `c = 3`, `b - c = 2` (even), but the program would incorrectly print 'Yes' instead of 'No'.
     - If `b % 2 != c % 2`, it prints 'No'. This is correct because the parity must match for the difference to be even.

### Corrected Analysis:

1. **Case 1: `b == c`:**
   - If the number of moves (`b`) is exactly equal to the desired number of cubes (`c`), Nikita can simply add one cube per move, ending up with `c` cubes. This is correctly handled by printing 'YES'.

2. **Case 2: `b < c`:**
   - If the number of moves (`b`) is less than the desired number of cubes (`c`), it's impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves. This is correctly handled by printing 'NO'.

3. **Case 3: `b > c`:**
   - If the number of moves (`b`) is greater than the desired number of cubes (`c`), we need to check if the difference between `b` and `c` is even.
     - If `(b - c) % 2 == 0`, it means the number of additions and removals can balance out to result in `c` cubes. This is correctly handled by printing 'Yes'.
     - If `(b - c) % 2 != 0`, it means the parity does not match, making it impossible to end up with `c` cubes. This is correctly handled by printing 'No'.

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect because it uses `b % 2 == c % 2` instead of checking if `(b - c) % 2 == 0`. The corrected version should use the difference between `b` and `c`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
