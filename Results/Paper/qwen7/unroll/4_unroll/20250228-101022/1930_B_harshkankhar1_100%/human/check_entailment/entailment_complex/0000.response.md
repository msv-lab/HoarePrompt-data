Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is evident from the loop `for _ in range(int(input()))`.

2. **Permutation Generation**: Within `func_1()`, the program generates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`. It then reverses every second element in the list. This operation ensures that the resulting permutation does not contain two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\).

3. **Divisibility Condition**: Consider the generated permutation after reversing every second element:
   - If \(n\) is even, the sequence will look like: \(1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-3, \ldots\).
   - If \(n\) is odd, the sequence will look like: \(1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-3, \ldots, (n-1)\).

   In both cases, the divisibility condition is satisfied because:
   - No two consecutive elements in the sequence can have the property where one divides the next.
   - For instance, in the sequence \(1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-3, \ldots\), no element \(p_i\) (where \(i\) is odd) can divide \(p_{i+1}\) (where \(i+1\) is even) due to the alternating pattern and the fact that the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2.

4. **Output**: The program prints the modified list, which is a valid permutation according to the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the required logic to generate a valid permutation for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
