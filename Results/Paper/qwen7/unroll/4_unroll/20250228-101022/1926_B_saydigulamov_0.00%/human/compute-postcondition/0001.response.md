Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`, which is being assigned values from `range(a)`. This means `i` will take values from `0` to `a-1` during the loop execution.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments by 1 until `i < a`, the initial value of `i` should be `0`.

3. **Understand the role of `a`**: The variable `a` represents the size of the grid (both rows and columns), and it is used to define the range for `i`. However, `a` itself does not change within the loop, so it remains the same as its initial value.

4. **Consider the grid**: The grid is a list of `a` strings, each containing `a` characters ('0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that contains all the '1's. This information is about the structure of the grid and does not affect the loop initialization directly.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Based on the above points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i`, which should be `0`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that `i` is `0`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0**
