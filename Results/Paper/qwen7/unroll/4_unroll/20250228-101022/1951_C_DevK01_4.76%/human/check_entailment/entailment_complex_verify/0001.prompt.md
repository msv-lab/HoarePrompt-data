You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #State: Output State: The final value of `t` will be the same as the initial value of `t`. For each iteration of the loop, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` will be updated based on the input lists `L` and `M`. The variable `cost` will be calculated differently depending on the values of `n` and `m`, and printed at the end of each iteration. After all iterations, the final state of `t`, along with all the `cost` values printed during each iteration, will be the output state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( t \), \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it calculates a cost based on the values of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), and prints the cost. The function updates the values of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) based on the input, sorts the list \( M \), and computes the cost using specific conditions. After processing all test cases, it outputs the final value of \( t \) and the costs calculated for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices `M` for each of the `n` days.

2. **Setting Up Variables:**
   - `n` is the number of days.
   - `m` is the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day.
   - `k` is the total number of tickets to be purchased.
   - `m = min(m, k)` ensures that `m` does not exceed `k`.

3. **Sorting Prices:**
   - The prices `M` are sorted in ascending order. This helps in considering the cheapest days first.

4. **Calculating the Minimum Cost:**
   - `q = int(math.ceil(k / m))` calculates how many days are needed to buy `k` tickets if we can buy up to `m` tickets per day.
   - `N = M[:q]` takes the first `q` elements from the sorted list `M`.
   - `n = len(N)` gives the number of days considered so far.

5. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n * m == k`, it means we can buy all `k` tickets within these `n` days without any price increase.
     - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` calculates the cost using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - Otherwise, it needs to handle the scenario where we need to buy more tickets after the initial `n` days.
     - `w = N.pop()` removes the last element from `N` (the most expensive ticket among the first `q` days).
     - `mu = k - (n - 1) * m` calculates the remaining tickets to be bought after the initial `n` days.
     - `cost = mu * w` adds the cost of buying `mu` tickets at the price `w`.
     - Adjusts the cost calculation for the remaining days.

### Correctness Check

1. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case when `n * m == k` by directly calculating the cost.
   - It also correctly handles the case when `n * m < k` by adjusting the cost calculation to account for the increased prices.

2. **Sorting and Selection:**
   - Sorting the prices in ascending order ensures that the program considers the cheapest days first, which is crucial for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Mathematical Formulas:**
   - The formulas used for calculating the cost are mathematically sound and correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

4. **Overall Logic:**
   - The overall logic of the program aligns with the problem requirements and correctly calculates the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

**Correctness: **True**
