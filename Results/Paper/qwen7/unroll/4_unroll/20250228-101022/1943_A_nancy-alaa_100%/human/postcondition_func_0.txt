The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \), a positive integer \( n \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers. For each test case, it prints either the smallest missing integer or the first integer that appears exactly once (if it's the second unique element encountered). The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.
