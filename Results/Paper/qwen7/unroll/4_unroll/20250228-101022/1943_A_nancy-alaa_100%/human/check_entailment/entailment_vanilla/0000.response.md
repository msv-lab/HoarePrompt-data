Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It then reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `arr`.

2. **Frequency Counting**:
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in the array `arr`.
   - This is a correct approach to understand how many times each number appears in the array.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.
   - The program attempts to find the smallest non-negative integer that is missing from the array `arr` by checking the presence of numbers from `0` to `n` in the counter `mpp`.

4. **Optimal Strategy Consideration**:
   - Alice can always pick elements such that the resulting array `c` will have the highest possible MEX.
   - Bob, on the other hand, can try to minimize the MEX.
   - The logic in the program does not fully account for the optimal strategies of both players. Specifically, it does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as described in the problem statement.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the first missing number found in the range `0` to `n` using the counter `mpp`.
   - However, this does not guarantee that the output is the optimal MEX value after both players have played optimally.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the game logic where both players play optimally. It simply finds the first missing number in the range `0` to `n`, which does not consider the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob during their turns.

### Correctness

**Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not simulate the optimal play of both players as required by the problem statement.
