Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `t` is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) is maintained, and the value of `t` is updated to the input integer. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
