Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided solution, let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `k == 1`, the program prints `1`. This is correct because if we need just one diagonal to have a colored cell, we can color any single cell in that diagonal, and since there are `n` cells per row/column, we can always find a diagonal with at least one cell.

3. **Case `k <= 2 * n`**:
   - The program calculates `math.ceil(k / 2)`. 
   - For a grid of size `n x n`, there are `2n` diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right (including both main diagonals). 
   - If `k` is within this range, coloring `math.ceil(k / 2)` cells ensures that at least `k` diagonals will have at least one colored cell. This is because each cell can contribute to up to 2 diagonals, and thus, `math.ceil(k / 2)` cells can cover at least `k` diagonals.

4. **Case `k > 2 * n`**:
   - The program prints `k // 2 + 1`.
   - Since there are `4n - 2` total diagonals, if `k` exceeds `2n`, we need to ensure that the remaining diagonals also have at least one colored cell. 
   - By coloring `k // 2 + 1` cells, we ensure that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell. This is because the additional cells (`k // 2 + 1 - k // 2 = 1`) help in covering the remaining required diagonals.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly handles all edge cases and ensures that the minimum number of cells needed to color is calculated accurately based on the value of `k` relative to `2n`.

Correctness: **True**
