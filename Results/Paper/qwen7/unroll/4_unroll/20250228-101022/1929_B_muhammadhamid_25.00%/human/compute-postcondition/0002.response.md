Output State: The output state consists of a series of lines, each containing either 1, \(\text{math.ceil}(k/2)\), or \(\text{k} // 2 + 1\), depending on the values of \(n\) and \(k\) for each test case. Specifically, for each test case:
- If \(k = 1\), the output is 1.
- If \(k \leq 2n\), the output is \(\text{math.ceil}(k/2)\).
- Otherwise, the output is \(\text{k} // 2 + 1\).
