Output State: **`t` is reduced to an input integer, and all other variables (including `n`, `k`, and `a`) are yet to be defined**.

This means that the initial value of `t` is now an input integer, while `n`, `k`, and `a` have not been assigned any values yet. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) still holds, but now `t` has been updated to the value input by the user.
