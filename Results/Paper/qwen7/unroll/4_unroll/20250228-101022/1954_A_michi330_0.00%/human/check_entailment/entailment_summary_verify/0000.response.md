Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided program does not handle the case where `m > k` properly. The function summary provided confirms that the function checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` to determine if Alice can achieve her goal. This logic is indeed incorrect because it does not account for the scenario where `m > k`.

Let's analyze the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if m > k:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

This corrected version directly checks if `m > k`. If `m > k`, Alice can always paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, Alice cannot guarantee that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

Given the problem description and the examples provided, this corrected version accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment was accurate, and the program has been correctly revised.

Final: **True**
