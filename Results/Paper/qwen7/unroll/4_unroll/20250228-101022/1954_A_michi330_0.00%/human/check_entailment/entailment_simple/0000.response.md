Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining if Alice can paint a ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts of the ribbon the same color, given constraints on the number of parts (`n`), colors (`m`), and the number of parts Bob can repaint (`k`).

2. **Key Conditions**:
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is "NO".
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it means there are not enough parts with the same color to prevent Bob from repainting enough parts to make all parts the same color, so the answer is "NO".
   - In all other cases, Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that prevents Bob from making all parts the same color, so the answer is "YES".

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - The condition checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`. If either condition is true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge cases where `n <= k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` correctly.
   - The logic ensures that if either condition is met, "NO" is printed, and otherwise, "YES" is printed.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - The conditions and logic are sound and handle all specified cases.

Correctness: **True**
