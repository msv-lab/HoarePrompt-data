### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
   - Alice can paint each part with any of `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to the same color.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, so Alice cannot prevent this.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it means that even after Bob repaints `k` parts, there will still be at least two different colors remaining. This is because `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of parts needed to ensure that at least one color appears at least `math.ceil(n / m)` times.

3. **Analysis of the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly checks if `n <= k` and prints 'NO' if true.
   - The code also checks if `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` and prints 'YES' if true.
   - The issue is with the output format; the code should print 'YES' instead of 'Yes'.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic for determining if Alice can prevent Bob from making all parts the same color is correct.
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` ensures that even after Bob repaints `k` parts, there will still be at least two different colors.
   - The issue is with the output format; the code should print 'YES' instead of 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:
The given program is almost correct but has a minor formatting issue. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment correctly identified the logical correctness of the program but did not address the minor formatting issue. Since the program needs to print 'YES' instead of 'Yes', the original assessment was **inaccurate**.

**Final: False**
