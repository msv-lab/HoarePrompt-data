Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of the same length as the maximum key in `d` initialized with zeros, an integer `da` which is a key in `d`, and a list `rank` initialized with zeros. It returns 1 in Case_1 and 1000000001 in Case_2.**
