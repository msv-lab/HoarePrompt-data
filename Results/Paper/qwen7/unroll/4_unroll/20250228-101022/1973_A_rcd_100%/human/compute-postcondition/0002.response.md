Output State: The output state will consist of a series of values printed based on the conditions within the loop. For each iteration, if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `-1` will be printed. Otherwise, if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, `p1 + p2` will be printed. If not, the loop will attempt to find integers `x` and `y` such that `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y` and `y >= x`. If such integers are found, `p1 - x + p3` will be printed; otherwise, `p3` will be printed.
