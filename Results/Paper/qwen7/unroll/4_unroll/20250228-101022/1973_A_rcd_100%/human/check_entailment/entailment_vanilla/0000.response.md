### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Score Validation**: 
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points to the winners or 2 points in total if it's a draw).
   - This check is necessary because the sum of the scores must be even for the scores to be achievable.
3. **Score Consistency Check**:
   - The program then checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 + p2`, which is the maximum possible number of draws. This is because if `p3` is at least as large as the sum of the other two scores, it means all games could have been draws.
4. **Detailed Calculation**:
   - If the above conditions fail, the program enters a loop where it tries to find the maximum number of draws by adjusting the values of `x` and `y` (representing the differences from `p1` and `p2` to `p3`).
   - The loop ensures that the difference between `p1 - x` and `p2 - y` does not exceed the possible scores given the constraints.
   - If a valid combination is found, it prints the number of draws as `p1 - x + p3`.

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly identifies when the scores are inconsistent (when the sum is odd or `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`).
- The detailed calculation within the loop aims to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the scores are consistent.
- The approach handles all given examples correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or return `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

### Correctness:
**True**
