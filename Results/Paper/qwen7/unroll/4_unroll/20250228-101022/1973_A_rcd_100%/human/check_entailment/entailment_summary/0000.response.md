Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \).

1. **Initial Check for Even Sum**: 
   - The program correctly checks if the sum of \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \) is even. If the sum is odd, it prints \(-1\) because an odd sum cannot be achieved with the given scoring rules (each game results in either 2 points for one player or 2 points distributed between two players in case of a draw).

2. **Handling the Case Where \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \)**:
   - If \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \), the program directly prints \( p_1 + p_2 \). This is a valid scenario where no draws occurred, and the scores match the condition where the third player did not play any games against the first and second players.

3. **General Case Calculation**:
   - For the general case, the program uses a while loop to find the maximum number of draws. The variables \( x \) and \( y \) are used to represent the number of games won by the first and second players, respectively, in a way that maximizes the number of draws.
   - The logic inside the while loop ensures that the number of draws is maximized by adjusting \( x \) and \( y \) such that the conditions \( p_1 - x \leq p_2 - y \) are met, which corresponds to the scenario where the difference in points between the first and second players is balanced by the number of draws.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of draws. It handles all edge cases and follows the rules specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
