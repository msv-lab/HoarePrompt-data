Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws for all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the scores do not allow for any valid set of games and results. 

For instance, consider the input `1 1 10`. According to the problem description, the scores should be consistent with a valid set of games. However, the program outputs `2` without checking if such a scenario is possible. In this case, it is impossible to achieve the score of 10 for one player and 1 for the other two players under the given rules, as the maximum score a single player can achieve through draws and wins is significantly lower. The program should output `-1` for such cases but instead incorrectly calculates a value.
