The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (size of the list), and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers. It then calculates and prints the sum of the number of times each element and its XOR with \( 2^{31} - 1 \) appeared an odd number of times across all inputs. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
