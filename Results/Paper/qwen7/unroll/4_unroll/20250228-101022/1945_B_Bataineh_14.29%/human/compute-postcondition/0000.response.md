Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, after executing the code, `t` will still be within this range, but its specific value will be determined by the user's input. All other variables remain unchanged, and the precondition that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 is preserved.
