Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the placeholder `_`, which is used as a throwaway variable to iterate over the range returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. This means we need to ensure that `int(input())` returns a valid number within the specified range.

3. **Initial state before the loop**: We know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), and `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\), \(p_i \neq i\), and all `p_i` are distinct.

4. **Adjusting the state**: For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a valid number of test cases. Since `t` is the number of test cases, we need to ensure that `t` is a valid input (i.e., within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\)).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is a valid input for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000**
