Reasoning:
- The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each friend and checking if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends.
- The logic in the program is flawed because:
  1. The program only checks for a single pair of friends who are each other's best friends (`q == i + 1`) and prints 2 if such a pair is found. However, this condition `q == i + 1` does not correctly identify pairs where both friends receive invitations.
  2. If no such pair is found, the program incorrectly prints 3, which is not always the correct answer. For example, in the third test case, the program should print 2, but it prints 3.
- The program needs to find at least one pair of friends who can both be invited, and if such a pair is found, it should print 2. If no such pair is found, it should check for the next best scenario, which might involve inviting more than just a pair but still ensuring at least two friends come to the party.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
