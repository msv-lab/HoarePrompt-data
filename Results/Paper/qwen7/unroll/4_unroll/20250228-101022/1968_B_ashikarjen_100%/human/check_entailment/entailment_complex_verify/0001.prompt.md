You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and similarly, the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

    #State: Output State: `j` is `m`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a string obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `b` is a string obtained from the next input, `k` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs for each character in the string `n`. For each iteration, it searches for the current character of `n` in the string `b`. If found, it increments `k` and `j`. If not found before the end of `b`, it breaks out of the loop. Since the problem does not specify any particular values for `n` and `b`, we can only say that `j` will be equal to `m` (length of `b`) after the loop finishes, assuming no matches were found and the loop broke. Other variables (`t`, `n`, `b`, `k`) remain unchanged.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the count of characters in n that are also present in b)
    return
    #`j` is `m`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a string obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `b` is a string obtained from the next input, `k` is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values for `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` from standard input. It then iterates through each character in `n` and checks if it exists in `b`. For each match found, it increments a counter `k`. After processing all characters in `n`, it prints the value of `k` and returns the values of `t`, `n`, `b`, and `k` as specified in the return postconditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts with a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, which represent the lengths of strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1()` to handle the logic for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it initializes two pointers `k` and `j` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character of string `a` using a for loop.
     - For each character `a[i]` in `a`, it uses a while loop to find the corresponding character in `b`.
     - If the character `a[i]` is found in `b`, it increments both `k` and `j`.
     - If the character `a[i]` is not found, it breaks out of the loop.
   - After the loop, it prints the value of `k`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the prefix of `a` is a subsequence of `b`.
   - It also correctly handles cases where the prefix of `a` is not a subsequence of `b` by breaking out of the loop early.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's walk through an example to ensure the logic is correct.

#### Example 1:
- Input:
  ```
  6
  5 4
  10011
  1110
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Program Execution:
  - `a = "10011"`, `b = "1110"`
  - `i = 0`: `a[0] = '1'`, `j = 0` (finds '1' at index 0 in `b`)
  - `i = 1`: `a[1] = '0'`, `j = 1` (finds '0' at index 1 in `b`)
  - `i = 2`: `a[2] = '0'`, `j = 2` (finds '0' at index 2 in `b`)
  - `i = 3`: `a[3] = '1'`, `j = 3` (finds '1' at index 3 in `b`)
  - `i = 4`: `a[4] = '1'`, `j = 4` (finds '1' at index 4 in `b`)
  - `k = 4` (but we only need the prefix length, so `k = 2`)

#### Example 2:
- Input:
  ```
  3 3
  100
  110
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Program Execution:
  - `a = "100"`, `b = "110"`
  - `i = 0`: `a[0] = '1'`, `j = 0` (finds '1' at index 0 in `b`)
  - `i = 1`: `a[1] = '0'`, `j = 1` (finds '0' at index 1 in `b`)
  - `i = 2`: `a[2] = '0'`, `j = 2` (finds '0' at index 2 in `b`)
  - `k = 2`

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum prefix length of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`. It handles all the given examples and edge cases appropriately.
