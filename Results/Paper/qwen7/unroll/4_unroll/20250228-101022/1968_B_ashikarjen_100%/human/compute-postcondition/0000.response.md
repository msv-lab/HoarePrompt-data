Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, n is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input, m is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means `n` and `m` are assigned the values of the first and second integers entered by the user, respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value within the range 1 to 10^4.
