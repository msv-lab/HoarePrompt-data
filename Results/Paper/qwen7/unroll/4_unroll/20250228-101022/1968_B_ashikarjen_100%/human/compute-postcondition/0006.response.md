Output State: `j` is `m`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a string obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `b` is a string obtained from the next input, `k` is 0.

Explanation: The loop runs for each character in the string `n`. For each iteration, it searches for the corresponding character in string `b`. If found, it increments `k` and `j`. If not found within the length of `b`, it breaks out of the loop. Since the loop does not modify `t`, `n`, `b`, or `k` outside the loop conditions, their states remain unchanged. After all iterations, `j` will be equal to the length of `b` (`m`).
