### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step based on the given problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program correctly checks if the sum of the points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because an odd total cannot be achieved through the given scoring rules (each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in total from a draw).

3. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`.
     - If true, it prints `p1 + p2`. 
     - This condition implies that the highest score (`p3`) is at least as high as the combined scores of the other two players. 
     - If this condition is met, the only way to achieve these scores is if the other two players had no wins and the highest scorer won all their games, which means no draws.
     - This logic is correct for the case where no draws are involved.

4. **Binary Search for Draws:**
   - If the above condition is not met, the program performs a binary search to find the maximum number of draws.
   - It sets `low` and `high` based on the difference between `p3` and `p1` and `p2`.
   - It iteratively checks if the current value of `cur` (which represents the number of draws) can satisfy the condition that `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks the loop.
   - If the condition is not satisfied, it increments `cur` and continues the search.
   - This approach aims to find the maximum number of draws that fit the given scores.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program fails to handle cases where the scores are inconsistent but do not meet the initial condition `p3 >= p1 + p2`. For example, in the case `1 1 10`, the program incorrectly prints `2` instead of `-1`.

Upon closer inspection, we realize that the program's logic for handling the binary search and the condition checking is flawed. Specifically, the binary search logic does not correctly account for all possible scenarios, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.

### Detailed Example Analysis:

- **Case `1 1 10`:**
  - The sum of the scores is `12`, which is even.
  - `p3 = 10` is not greater than or equal to `p1 + p2 = 2`.
  - The program attempts to find the maximum number of draws using binary search.
  - However, the logic for determining the maximum number of draws is incorrect, leading to an incorrect output of `2` instead of `-1`.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that the program handles all edge cases properly. Specifically, we need to check if the scores are consistent with the rules of the game. Here is a revised approach:

1. **Check if the total points are even.**
2. **Check if `p3 >= p1 + p2`.**
3. **If not, check if the scores can be achieved with a combination of wins and draws.**

### Revised Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            # Calculate the maximum possible number of draws
            max_draws = (p3 - p1 + p3 - p2) // 2
            if max_draws * 2 == p3 - p1 + p3 - p2:
                print(max_draws)
            else:
                print(-1)

func()
```

### Final Evaluation:

Given the revised approach and the detailed analysis, the original program is indeed incorrect due to its flawed handling of edge cases. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
