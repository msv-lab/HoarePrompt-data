Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 within the range 0 to 30 (inclusive) and a positive integer t within the range 1 to 500 (inclusive). The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information.**

However, based on the constraints and relationships provided, the function likely processes these parameters internally but does not return a value. Therefore, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3, and a positive integer t. It validates that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 and 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned.**
