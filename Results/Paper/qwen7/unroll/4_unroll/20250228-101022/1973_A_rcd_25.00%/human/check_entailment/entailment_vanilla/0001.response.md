Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because an odd total cannot be achieved through the given scoring rules (each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in total from a draw).
   - This check is correct.

3. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`.
     - If true, it prints `p1 + p2`. 
     - This condition implies that the highest score (`p3`) is at least as high as the combined scores of the other two players. 
     - If this condition is met, the only way to achieve these scores is if the other two players had no wins and the highest scorer won all their games, which means no draws.
     - This logic is correct for the case where no draws are involved.

4. **Binary Search for Draws:**
   - If the above condition is not met, the program performs a binary search to find the maximum number of draws.
   - It sets `low` and `high` based on the difference between `p3` and `p1` and `p2`.
   - It iteratively checks if the current value of `cur` (which represents the number of draws) can satisfy the condition that `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks the loop.
   - If the condition is not satisfied, it increments `cur` and continues the search.
   - This approach aims to find the maximum number of draws that fit the given scores.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle some edge cases properly, such as when the scores are inconsistent but do not meet the initial condition `p3 >= p1 + p2`.
   - For example, in the case `1 1 10`, the program incorrectly prints `2` instead of `-1`.

### Conclusion:

The program has logical flaws in handling certain edge cases, particularly when the scores are inconsistent but do not meet the initial condition `p3 >= p1 + p2`. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
