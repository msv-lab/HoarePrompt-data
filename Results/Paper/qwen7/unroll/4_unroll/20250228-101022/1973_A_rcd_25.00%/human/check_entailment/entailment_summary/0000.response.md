Reasoning:

1. **Sum Check**: The program correctly checks if the sum of \(p1\), \(p2\), and \(p3\) is even. If the sum is odd, it prints \(-1\), which is correct because an odd sum cannot be achieved through the scoring system where each win contributes 2 points and each draw contributes 1 point to the total score.

2. **Invalid Score Configuration**: The program correctly identifies the invalid configuration where \(p3 \geq p1 + p2\). In this case, it prints \(-1\), which is correct because it is impossible to achieve such a score distribution without violating the rules of the game.

3. **Finding Maximum Draws**: The program attempts to find the maximum number of draws by iterating over possible values of \(cur\). However, the logic to find \(cur\) is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is not sufficient to ensure the maximum number of draws. This condition only checks if the difference in points between the first and third player and the difference in points between the second and third player are balanced, but it does not necessarily maximize the number of draws.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases like the first test case (0, 0, 0) and the second test case (0, 1, 1) correctly. However, it fails to handle some other edge cases, such as (1, 1, 2) and (1, 1, 10), as shown in the examples provided.

5. **Output**: The program prints the results directly without returning any value, which is acceptable for the given problem constraints.

Given the issues with the logic to find the maximum number of draws, the program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
