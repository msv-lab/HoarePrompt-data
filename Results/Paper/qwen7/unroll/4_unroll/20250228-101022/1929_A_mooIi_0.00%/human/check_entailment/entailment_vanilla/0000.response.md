Let's analyze the provided program step by step:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Length and Elements**: For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array elements.
3. **Sorting and Rearranging**: The program sorts the array elements and then converts them back to a list of strings. It then prints these elements joined with spaces.

### Problem Analysis:
- The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements: \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \).
- To maximize this sum, we should ideally have the smallest element in the first position and the largest element in the last position, with the remaining elements in any order.

### Issues in the Provided Program:
- The program sorts the array but does not rearrange the elements to achieve the maximum beauty. Instead, it simply prints the sorted array as a string.
- Sorting the array does not guarantee that the beauty will be maximized because the relative positions of the elements are not adjusted to maximize the differences.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: Input: `[2, 1, 3]`. The program outputs `[1, 2, 3]`, which has a beauty of 2, but this is not the optimal arrangement.
- **Test Case 2**: Input: `[69, 69, 69]`. The program outputs `[69, 69, 69]`, which has a beauty of 0, which is correct.
- **Test Case 3**: Input: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`. The program outputs `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, which has a beauty of 57, but this is not the optimal arrangement.
- **Test Case 4**: Input: `[3, 4, 3, 3]`. The program outputs `[3, 3, 3, 4]`, which has a beauty of 1, but this is not the optimal arrangement.
- **Test Case 5**: Input: `[2, 1]`. The program outputs `[1, 2]`, which has a beauty of 1, but this is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not rearrange the elements to maximize the beauty. Instead, it simply sorts the array and prints it.

**Correctness: False**
