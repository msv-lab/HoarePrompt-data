Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. However, the provided code simply sorts the array and prints it. This does not maximize the beauty of the array according to the given definition.

To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the elements such that the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` are maximized. The optimal strategy is to sort the array and then pair the smallest and largest elements together, effectively maximizing the positive differences while minimizing the negative ones.

The provided code does not implement this logic. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
