Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. However, the program simply sorts the array and prints the sorted array as a string of space-separated values. This does not maximize the beauty of the array according to the given definition.

To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the elements such that the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` are maximized. One effective strategy is to place the smallest element at index 1 and the largest element at index `n`, and then fill the remaining positions with the next smallest and largest elements alternately. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

Given this analysis, the provided program does not achieve the objective of maximizing the beauty of the array. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
