Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \). However, the provided code simply sorts the array and prints it. This does not address the requirement to maximize the beauty of the array.

To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array such that the largest difference between consecutive elements is maximized. One effective strategy is to sort the array and then place the smallest and largest elements alternately. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are as large as possible.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the array
        ar.sort()
        
        # Initialize variables to store the maximum beauty
        max_beauty = 0
        
        # Calculate the maximum beauty
        for i in range(n - 1):
            max_beauty += abs(ar[i + 1] - ar[i])
        
        print(max_beauty)
```

This corrected function sorts the array and then calculates the maximum beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Given the provided code does not solve the problem correctly, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
