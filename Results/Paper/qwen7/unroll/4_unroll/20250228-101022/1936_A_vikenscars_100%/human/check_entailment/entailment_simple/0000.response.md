### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation (`n`).
   - It calls `func_2(n)` to handle the logic for finding the optimal pair of indices.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly prints a query in the required format and waits for the response.
   - The response is returned as a string, which is expected.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function initializes `max_item_idx` to 0.
   - It iterates through indices from 1 to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_{max_item_idx})` with `(p_i \mid p_i)` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
   - If the response is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to `i`.
   - After determining `max_item_idx`, it iterates through all indices again to find `pair_idx` such that `(p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_{max_item_idx})` is less than `(p_{pair_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx})` and `(p_{pair_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx})` is greater than `(p_i \mid p_i)` for all `i`.

4. **Query Logic:**
   - The logic for finding `pair_idx` ensures that the XOR of the pair is maximized.
   - The function correctly prints the final answer in the required format.

5. **Query Limits:**
   - The program ensures that it does not exceed the allowed 3n queries per test case.
   - Proper flushing of the output is handled.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `max_item_idx` might remain 0 if no suitable `i` is found in the first loop.
   - The second loop ensures that the pair found has the maximum XOR value.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem specification correctly and should work as intended.

### Correctness:
