Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `range(n)`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 (since `range(n)` generates values from 0 to n-1).
3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`.
- `max_item_idx` is the index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists within the range 1 to n-1.

Since the loop starts with `i` being 0, we need to ensure that the loop can proceed. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` (which starts at 0) is less than `n`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

1. **Initial value of `i`**: `i` starts at 0.
2. **Condition for loop execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

### Final State:

- `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`.
- `max_item_idx` is the index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists within the range 1 to n-1.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`, `max_item_idx` is the index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists within the range 1 to n-1, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**.
