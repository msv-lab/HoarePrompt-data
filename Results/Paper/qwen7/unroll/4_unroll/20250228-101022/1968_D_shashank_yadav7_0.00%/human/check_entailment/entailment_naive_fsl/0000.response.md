Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game for all possible scenarios. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

### Counterexample:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  3 3 1 2
  3 1 2
  10 2 5
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - Bodya starts at position 1.
  - Sasha starts at position 2.
  - After the first turn:
    - Bodya's position: 1 → 3 (since \(p_1 = 3\))
    - Sasha's position: 2 → 1 (since \(p_2 = 1\))
  - After the second turn:
    - Bodya's position: 3 → 2 (since \(p_3 = 2\))
    - Sasha's position: 1 → 2 (since \(p_1 = 2\))
  - After the third turn:
    - Bodya's position: 2 → 1 (since \(p_2 = 1\))
    - Sasha's position: 2 → 3 (since \(p_2 = 3\))

- **Expected Scores:**
  - Bodya's score: \(a_1 + a_3 + a_2 = 10 + 5 + 2 = 17\)
  - Sasha's score: \(a_2 + a_1 + a_3 = 2 + 10 + 5 = 17\)

- **Actual Output:**
  - The program incorrectly calculates the scores and outputs "Draw" instead of checking the final scores accurately.

### Issue in the Program:
The program incorrectly accumulates the scores in a way that doesn't reflect the actual game rules. Specifically, the scores are updated without properly considering the sequence of moves and the maximum possible score at each step.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly simulate the game, the program should:
1. Initialize the starting positions and scores.
2. Simulate each turn, updating positions and scores based on the rules.
3. Ensure the scores are updated correctly for each possible move.

Since the provided program does not handle the game logic correctly, it fails to produce the expected output for certain inputs, making it incorrect.
