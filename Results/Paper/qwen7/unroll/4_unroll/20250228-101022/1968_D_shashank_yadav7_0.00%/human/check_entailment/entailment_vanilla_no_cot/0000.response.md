Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Here's a brief explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` (Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions), and then the arrays `p` and `a`.
3. **Adjusting Starting Positions**: It adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` to be zero-indexed.
4. **Initial Scores Calculation**: It initializes the scores for Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`) based on their initial positions.
5. **Game Simulation**: It simulates the game for `k` turns, updating the positions and scores for both players. For each turn, it updates the positions using the permutation `p` and calculates the new scores considering the maximum possible score for each player.
6. **Result Determination**: After `k` turns, it compares the final scores and prints the result accordingly.

The logic in the program accurately reflects the rules of the game and handles all the necessary calculations to determine the winner. Therefore, the program is correct.
