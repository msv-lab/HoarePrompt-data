Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads in values for n, k, P_B, P_S, a permutation p, and an array a. It then calculates two scores, `bm` and `sm`, based on certain rules involving the elements of p and a. Finally, it compares these scores and prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on their relative values. The function returns nothing but prints the result for each test case.**
