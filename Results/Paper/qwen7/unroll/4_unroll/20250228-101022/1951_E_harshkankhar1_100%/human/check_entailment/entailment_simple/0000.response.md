### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires partitioning a string `s` into substrings such that none of these substrings form a palindrome. The solution provided has two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing `s` with its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes each test case.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s)`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome (`func_1(s) == False`), it prints "YES", `1`, and the string `s` itself, indicating that the string can be partitioned into one non-palindromic substring.
     - If `s` is a palindrome, it proceeds to find the first character in `s` that is different from the first character.
     - It iterates through the string starting from the second character to find the first mismatch.
     - If no mismatch is found (`x == -1`), it prints "NO", indicating that no such partition exists.
     - If a mismatch is found, it checks if the substring from the first character to the mismatch point and the substring after the mismatch point are both non-palindromic.
       - If they are non-palindromic, it prints "YES", `2`, and the two substrings.
       - If they are palindromic, it further checks specific conditions to determine if a valid partition can be formed.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly handles the cases where the string can or cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - It correctly identifies when the string is a palindrome and when it can be split into non-palindromic parts.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases like single-character strings and strings with all characters being the same (like `"aaa"`).

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints the appropriate output for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
