Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is an input string.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from the first character of `s`.
- `func_1(s[0:])` is `True`.
- `x` is not equal to `-1`.
- The function `func_1(s[x + 1:])` evaluates to `False`.

The print statement is `print('YES')`.

Given these conditions, the print statement will simply output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
