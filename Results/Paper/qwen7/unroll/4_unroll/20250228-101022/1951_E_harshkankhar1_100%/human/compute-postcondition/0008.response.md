Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 1 (since the loop starts from `range(1, n)`).
   - The variable `n` is the length of the input string `s`.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` should be set to 1.
   - `n` should be set to the length of the string `s`.

4. **Consider the other given variables**:
   - `x` is initially set to -1, but this value is not relevant to the loop's execution.
   - `func_1(s[0:])` being True is a condition that holds true before the loop starts, but it doesn't affect the loop's initialization.

Based on the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 1.
- `n` should be the length of the string `s`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the length of the input string `s`**.
