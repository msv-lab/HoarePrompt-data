Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings when the entire string itself is a palindrome but can be split into smaller non-palindromic substrings.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
test
```

Expected output:
```
YES
2
te st
```

However, the program will output:
```
NO
```

This happens because the program checks if the entire string is a palindrome and only considers splitting the string if it is not. In the case of "test," the program incorrectly determines that the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings, even though it can be split into "te" and "st."

To fix this, the program should check for smaller non-palindromic substrings instead of just checking the entire string. Here's a revised version of the `func_2` function that addresses this issue:

```python
def func_2():
    s = input().strip()
    (n, x) = (len(s), -1)
    
    # Check if the entire string is a palindrome
    if func_1(s) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    
    # Try to find a non-palindromic substring
    for i in range(1, n):
        if func_1(s[:i]) == False or func_1(s[i:]) == False:
            x = i
            break
    
    if x == -1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x], ' ', s[x:])
```

This revised function checks for non-palindromic substrings by examining both the prefix and suffix of the string for each possible split point.
