Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is an input string.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from the first character of `s`.
- `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to half the length of `s`.
- `func_1(s[0:])` is True, meaning the function `func_1` returns True when applied to the entire string `s`.
- `x` is not equal to -1, ensuring that `x` is a valid index.
- `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True, meaning the function `func_1` returns True when applied to the substring starting from index `x + 1`.

Given these conditions, we need to determine what `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]` will be when the print statement executes.

1. Since `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from the first character of `s`, and `x` is not equal to 1, it means the first character of `s` is repeated until the `x`-th position, and then the next character is different.
2. `x` is also not equal to half the length of `s`, so the first part of the string `s[:x + 2]` will include the first character repeated at least twice, and the second part `s[x + 2:]` will start after the first different character.

Let's assume a specific example to illustrate this:
- Suppose `s = "aaaaab"`, then `x = 5` because the first character 'a' repeats until the 5th position where 'b' starts.
- Here, `s[:x + 2] = "aaaaa"` and `s[x + 2:] = "b"`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **"aaaaa" b**
