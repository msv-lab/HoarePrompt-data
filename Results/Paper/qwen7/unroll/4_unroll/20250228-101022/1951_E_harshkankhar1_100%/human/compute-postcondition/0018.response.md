Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is an input string.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from the first character of `s`.
- `func_1(s[0:])` is `True`, meaning the substring from the start of `s` to the end satisfies some condition checked by `func_1`.
- `x` is not equal to `-1`, meaning there is at least one character in `s` that differs from the first character.
- `func_1(s[x + 1:])` evaluates to `False`, meaning the substring starting from `x + 1` does not satisfy the condition checked by `func_1`.

The print statement is `print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])`.

Given these conditions, `s[:x + 1]` is the substring of `s` from the start up to and including the character at index `x`, and `s[x + 1:]` is the substring of `s` starting from the character after index `x` to the end of the string.

Therefore, the output will be the concatenation of `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]` separated by a space.

Output: **s[:x + 1] s[x + 1:]**
