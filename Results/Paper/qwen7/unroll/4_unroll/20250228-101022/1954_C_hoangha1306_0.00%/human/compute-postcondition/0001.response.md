State: **`x` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `t` must be greater than 0, `q` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `q` is initialized to 0 in the range function.
2. The loop condition `for q in range(t)` checks if `q < t`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
4. The initial values of `x` and `y` do not affect the loop's execution condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` (must be greater than 0) and `q` (is 0).
