Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each line containing either `k - 1` or `n`, depending on the values of `n`, `k`, and the list `l` provided in each iteration of the loop. The number of lines will be equal to the value of `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive). Each line's content is determined by whether the maximum frequency of any unique element in the list `l` is greater than or equal to `k`. If true, it prints `k - 1`; otherwise, it prints `n`.
