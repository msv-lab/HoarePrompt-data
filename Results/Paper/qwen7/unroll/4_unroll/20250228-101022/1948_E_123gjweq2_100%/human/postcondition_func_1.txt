The function `make_array` takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It modifies an array `arr` by filling a segment of it with a sequence of increasing integers starting from `left + 1` up to `right + 1` and assigns the value of `clique` to a corresponding segment in another list `cliquess`. Specifically, it fills the first half of the specified segment with increasing values and the second half with decreasing values, ensuring that the entire segment is covered.
