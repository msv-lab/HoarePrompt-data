Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function correctly reads the input for each test case and calls `func_2(k, x, a)` to process the array.
   - It sorts the array `a` before calling `func_2`, which is necessary to determine the optimal strategy for both players.
   
2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - The function checks if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3. If so, it returns 0, which is correct based on the problem statement.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after Alice removes up to `removals` elements and Bob multiplies up to `negatives` elements by -1.
   - The logic within `func_2` iterates through possible removals and negations to find the maximum sum, considering the constraints.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, both functions seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The sorting step in `func_1` ensures that Alice can optimally choose which elements to remove, and `func_2` correctly handles the optimal strategy for Bob's negations.

Correctness: **True**
