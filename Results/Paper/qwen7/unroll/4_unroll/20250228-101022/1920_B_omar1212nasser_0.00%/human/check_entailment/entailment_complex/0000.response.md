Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a`.
   - It sorts the list `a` before calling `func_2(k, x, a)`.
   - The function then prints the result returned by `func_2(k, x, a)` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - The function has a conditional check that returns 0 if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3.
   - Otherwise, it initializes an empty list `pos` to store possible sums.
   - It calculates the initial sum `s` of the entire list `elements` and the sum `n` of the last `negatives` elements.
   - It appends `s - 2 * n` to `pos` and iteratively updates `s` and `n` by removing the largest elements and adjusting `n` accordingly.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

However, there is a logical flaw in `func_2()`. The function should consider the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob, but the current implementation does not fully account for their strategies. Specifically:
- The function does not handle the case where Alice removes the smallest elements first and Bob negates the largest elements to minimize the sum.
- The logic inside the loop does not correctly simulate the optimal moves for both players.

Given the example inputs and outputs, we can see that the function's behavior does not match the expected optimal outcomes for some cases. For instance, in the fifth test case, the expected output is `-5`, but the function returns `0`.

Therefore, the provided implementation does not correctly simulate the optimal strategies for both players.

Correctness: **False**
