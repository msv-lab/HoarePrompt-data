Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` followed by the array `a`.
   - Sorts the array `a`.
   - Calls `func_2` with `k`, `x`, and the sorted array `a`.
   - Prints the result returned by `func_2`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Checks if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3. If true, it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it initializes an empty list `pos` to store potential sums.
   - Calculates the initial sum `s` of the array `elements`.
   - Adds `s - 2 * n` to `pos`, where `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`.
   - Loops from 1 to `removals` (inclusive), reducing `removals` and `negatives` by 1 each time:
     - Updates `s` by subtracting the `i-th` largest element of `elements`.
     - Tries to update `n` by adding the difference between the `(negatives + i)-th` and `i-th` largest elements of `elements`. If an `IndexError` occurs (when `negatives + i > len(elements)`), sets `n` to 0.
     - Appends `s - 2 * n` to `pos`.
   - Returns the maximum value from `pos`.

Given this analysis, the logic in `func_2` is flawed because:
- It does not correctly simulate the game's rules.
- The loop should consider the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob, but the current implementation does not handle the removals and negations properly.
- The check for `removals == 6 and negatives == 3` is hardcoded and does not reflect the general solution.

However, the annotated program does not fully implement the correct logic for the game. The current implementation does not account for the optimal strategies of both players, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.
