Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Hardcoded Condition**: The function `func_2` contains a hardcoded condition `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3: return 0`. This is incorrect and should be removed because it doesn't handle all possible cases and is not based on the logic of the game.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Calculating Maximum Sum**: The logic inside `func_2` for calculating the maximum sum is flawed. It incorrectly calculates the sum after removing elements and flipping signs without considering the optimal strategy for both players.

3. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The optimal strategy for both players (Alice and Bob) is not correctly implemented. Alice aims to maximize the sum by removing the smallest elements, and Bob aims to minimize the sum by flipping the signs of the largest elements. The current implementation does not reflect this optimal strategy.

### Correct Solution:
Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Remove k smallest elements
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Sort remaining elements in descending order
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Flip signs of the largest x elements
        a[:x] = [-val if val > 0 else val for val in a[:x]]
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        result = sum(a)
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func_1()
```

This solution correctly implements the optimal strategy for both players:
- Alice removes the k smallest elements.
- Bob flips the signs of the x largest remaining elements.
- Finally, it calculates the sum of the modified array.
