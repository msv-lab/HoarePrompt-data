Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling and Sorting:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` and sorts the array `a`.
   - This part is correct and necessary for the subsequent logic.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` is called with parameters `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`.
   - It checks if `removals` is exactly 6 and `negatives` is exactly 3, returning 0 in this specific case. This check seems arbitrary and does not align with the general logic required for the problem.
   - It initializes a list `pos` to store potential sums.
   - It calculates the initial sum `s` of all elements and the sum `n` of the last `negatives` elements.
   - It appends `s - 2 * n` to `pos` to account for the scenario where no elements are removed and all `negatives` elements are negated.
   - It iterates up to `removals` times, updating `s` and `n` in each iteration to consider different scenarios of removing elements and negating others.
   - It appends the calculated sum to `pos` for each iteration.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from `pos`.

3. **Logic for Optimal Strategy:**
   - The logic in `func_2` seems to be trying to simulate different strategies for Alice and Bob but has a hardcoded check for `removals == 6 and negatives == 3`, which is not aligned with the problem statement.
   - The core idea should be to maximize the sum for Alice and minimize it for Bob. The current implementation does not fully capture this strategy.

### Issues Identified:
- The hardcoded check `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3: return 0` is not relevant to the general solution and can be removed.
- The logic inside the loop for updating `s` and `n` needs to be more generalized to handle all possible scenarios of removals and negations.
- The function should consider all possible ways Alice can remove elements and Bob can negate elements to find the optimal sum.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation has issues with the hardcoded check and the logic for handling different scenarios. Therefore, the program is not correct as per the problem description.

**Correctness: **False**
