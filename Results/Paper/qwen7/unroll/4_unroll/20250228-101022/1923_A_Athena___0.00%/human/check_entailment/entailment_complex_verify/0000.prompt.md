You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:

        print(res)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the i-th cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1); in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.

    #State: Output State: t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. After executing the loop, for each input, the output consists of the list `a` with leading and trailing zeros removed, followed by the count of zeros in the modified list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n and a sequence of n binary values. It removes any leading and trailing zeros from the sequence and then counts the number of zeros remaining in the sequence. For each test case, it outputs the modified sequence followed by the count of zeros.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. The program removes leading and trailing zeros but does not account for the necessary moves to bring chips closer together.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
4
1 0 1 1
```

The program will output `1`, but the correct answer should be `2`. Here's why:
- Initially, the cells are `[1, 0, 1, 1]`.
- Moving the chip in the 2nd cell to the 1st cell results in `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.

The program fails to simulate the actual moves needed to bring all chips together. It only removes leading and trailing zeros without considering the operations required to achieve the desired configuration.
