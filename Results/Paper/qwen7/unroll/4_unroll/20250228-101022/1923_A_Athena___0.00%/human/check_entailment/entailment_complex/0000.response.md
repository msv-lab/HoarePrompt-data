Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The logic in the program focuses on removing leading and trailing zeros and counting the remaining zeros, which does not address the requirement to move chips to form a single block. The problem requires moving chips to the closest free cell to the left until all chips are contiguous, which is not achieved by simply removing zeros and counting them.

Here's a breakdown of why the current implementation is incorrect:
1. **Removing Leading and Trailing Zeros**: This step is unnecessary and does not contribute to solving the problem. The goal is to move chips, not to remove zeros.
2. **Counting Zeros**: Counting the number of zeros after removing leading and trailing zeros does not provide the minimum number of operations needed to form a contiguous block of chips.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Identify the positions of all chips.
- Determine the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
