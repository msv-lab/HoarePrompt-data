Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `s` is 0.

Explanation: The loop processes each value of `i` from 0 to `a-1`. For each iteration, it reads an integer `d` and a string `b`. It then iterates over each character in `b`, counting the occurrences of the character '@'. If it encounters two consecutive '*' characters at any point, it breaks out of the inner loop. After processing the inner loop, it prints the count of '@' characters and resets `s` to 0 for the next iteration. Since the problem does not specify any particular values for `d` or `b`, and the final state of `s` is always reset to 0 at the end of each iteration, the final value of `s` remains 0.
