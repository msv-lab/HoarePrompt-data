Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, a is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive.**

The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and the value of `a` is set to the integer input, which is between 1 and 50 inclusive. The string input is not affected by this code.
