The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `d` followed by a string `b` of length up to 50, containing characters '.', '@', and '*'. It counts the number of '@' characters in the string `b`, ignoring any string that contains consecutive '*'s. If the string does not contain consecutive '*'s and starts with '.', it prints the count of '@' characters and resets the count to 0 for the next test case. The final output for each test case is the count of '@' characters found in the string `b`.
