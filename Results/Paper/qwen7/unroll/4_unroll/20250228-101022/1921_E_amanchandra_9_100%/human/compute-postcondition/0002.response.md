Output State: The output state depends on the input values provided within each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if `a > c`, it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates `x` as half the absolute difference between `a` and `c`. Based on whether this difference is odd or even, it then determines the ranges for `l` and `r` and checks conditions involving `b` and `d` to decide whether to print 'Alice' or 'Bob'. The final output state is a series of 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration of the loop.
