#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, edges is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, and start is an integer representing the starting node for the game. Each node is uniquely identified by an integer from 1 to n. The tree has exactly two leaves, and edges form a valid tree structure.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: `tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node (an integer from 1 to n) and the corresponding value is a list containing all the nodes it is connected to through the edges specified in the `edges` list. The `start` variable remains unchanged and still represents the starting node for the game.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns 'Ron'
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree), and `start` (the starting node for the game). It constructs a tree representation using these inputs. Then, it identifies the two leaves in the tree and calculates the shortest distances from the `start` node to each leaf using breadth-first search (BFS). Based on whether these distances are even or odd, the function returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.
