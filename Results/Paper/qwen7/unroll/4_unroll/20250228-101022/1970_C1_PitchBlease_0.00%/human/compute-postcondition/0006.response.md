Output State: **`tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node (an integer from 1 to n) and the corresponding value is a list containing all the nodes it is connected to through the edges specified in the `edges` list; `leaves` is a list containing all the nodes which have only one connection through; `dist1` is the distance from `start` to `leaves[0]` using BFS; `dist2` is the distance from `start` to `leaves[1]` using BFS.**

Explanation: The code `dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])` calculates the shortest path distance from the starting node (`start`) to the second leaf node (`leaves[1]`) using Breadth-First Search (BFS). This distance is stored in the variable `dist2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
