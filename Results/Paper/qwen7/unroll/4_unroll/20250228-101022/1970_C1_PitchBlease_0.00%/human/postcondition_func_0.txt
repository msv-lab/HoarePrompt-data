The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree), and `start` (the starting node for the game). It constructs a tree representation using these inputs. Then, it identifies the two leaves in the tree and calculates the shortest distances from the `start` node to each leaf using breadth-first search (BFS). Based on whether these distances are even or odd, the function returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.
