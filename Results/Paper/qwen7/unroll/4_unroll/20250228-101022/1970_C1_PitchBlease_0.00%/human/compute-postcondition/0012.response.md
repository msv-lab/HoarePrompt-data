The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree), and `start` (an integer representing the starting node for the game). Each node is uniquely identified by an integer from 1 to `n`. The tree has exactly two leaves, and `edges` form a valid tree structure.

Based on the starting node and the structure of the tree, the function returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `edges`, and `start`. It returns 'Ron' if the conditions lead to that outcome, otherwise it returns 'Hermione'.**
