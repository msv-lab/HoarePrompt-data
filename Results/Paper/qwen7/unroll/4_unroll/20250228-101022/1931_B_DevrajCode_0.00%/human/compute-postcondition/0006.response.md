Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `water` and the list `a`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`, assigning each element to the variable `water` in each iteration.

3. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The list `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `water` will take on the values from the list `a` in each iteration, starting with the first element.

4. **Consider the given states**:
   - `total_water` is the sum of all integers in list `a`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `target` is `total_water // n`.
   - `container` is 0 (this variable is not used in the loop, so it doesn't affect the loop execution).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop needs to iterate over the elements of `a`, `a` must have at least one element.
   - In the first iteration, `water` will be set to the first element of `a`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `a` must have at least one element.
- `water` should be set to the first element of `a`.

Therefore, the final state after adjustment is:

**State: **`total_water` is the sum of all integers in list `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least one element, `water` is the first element of `a`**.
