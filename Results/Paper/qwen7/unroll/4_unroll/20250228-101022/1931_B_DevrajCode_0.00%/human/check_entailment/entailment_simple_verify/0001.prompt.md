You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and a is a list of n integers where each integer represents the amount of water in the corresponding container. The sum of all integers in the list is divisible by n.
def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if (total_water % n != 0) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State: `total_water` is the sum of all integers in list `a`, and `n` is a positive integer, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer represents the amount of water in the corresponding container. The sum of all integers in the list is divisible by `n`, and `total_water % n == 0`
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
        
    #State: Output State: `total_water` is the sum of all integers in list `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer represents the amount of water in the corresponding container, `target` is `total_water // n`, `container` is the sum of `(water - target)` for each `water` in list `a`. If any `(water - target)` makes `container` negative during the loop, the loop returns 'No'.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can make the amount of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another.
   - The key observation is that the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers (`n`).

2. **Given Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the input and processes it in a specific way.
   - It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`.
   - If the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, it immediately returns 'No'.
   - If the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, it calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It then iterates through the containers and keeps track of the difference between the current container's water and the target amount.
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the containers, so it returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'No', it returns 'Yes'.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in the program is sound. If the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, it is always possible to balance the containers by pouring water from containers with more water to those with less water until they all have the same amount.
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the total amount of water is not divisible by `n` and immediately returns 'No'.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the total amount of water is divisible by `n` and checks if it's possible to balance the containers.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

### Correctness:
**True**
