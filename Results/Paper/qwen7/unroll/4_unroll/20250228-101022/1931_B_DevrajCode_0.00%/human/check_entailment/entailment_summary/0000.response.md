Reasoning:
1. The problem requires checking if it's possible to redistribute water among containers so that each container has the same amount of water.
2. The solution correctly calculates the average amount of water per container (`target = total_water // n`).
3. It then iterates through each container, tracking the difference between the current container's water and the target. If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means that it's impossible to redistribute the water without some containers ending up with less than zero water, which is not allowed.
4. The logic in the function appears to be sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
5. The provided execution summary indicates that the function behaves as expected in the given test cases.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
