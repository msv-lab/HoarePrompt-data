### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This part is correct and efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the total amount of water in all containers (`total_water = sum(a)`).
   - **Step 2:** Check if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, return 'No'. This check ensures that it's even possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.
   - **Step 3:** Calculate the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).
   - **Step 4:** Initialize a variable `container` to keep track of the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the target amount.
   - **Step 5:** Iterate through each container and update `container` by adding the difference between the current water amount and the target amount.
     - If at any point `container` becomes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the containers to the target amount, so return 'No'.
   - **Step 6:** If the loop completes without returning 'No', return 'Yes'.

The logic in the program is sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem. The program correctly identifies whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by ensuring that the total water is divisible by the number of containers and checking if the cumulative difference can remain non-negative throughout the process.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided annotations.
