Output State: Alice or Bob will be printed based on the input values for each test case. For each test case, if there exists at least one pair of consecutive elements in the sorted unique list of stones where the difference is greater than 1, the game stops immediately, and "Alice" is printed. Otherwise, if no such pair exists, "Bob" is printed after checking all pairs.
