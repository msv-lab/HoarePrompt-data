Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading the number of piles (`n`) and the sizes of the piles (`arr`).
2. **Set and Sorting**: The program converts the list of pile sizes into a sorted list of unique sizes (`s`). This step ensures that we only consider distinct pile sizes, which is crucial for the game logic.
3. **Game Logic**:
   - The program checks if there are exactly two unique pile sizes. If so, it immediately prints "Alice" because Alice can always win by reducing the larger pile to match the smaller one.
   - If there are more than two unique pile sizes, it iterates through the sorted list to check if any two consecutive pile sizes differ by more than 1. If such a pair is found, it breaks the loop and prints "Alice".
   - If no such pair is found, it toggles a boolean value (`ans`) to determine the winner. The logic here is based on the XOR operation, which alternates between 0 and 1. If `ans` is 1 after the loop, "Alice" is printed; otherwise, "Bob" is printed.
4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs "Alice" or "Bob" based on the optimal strategy for each test case.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program correctly implements the game logic and outputs the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
