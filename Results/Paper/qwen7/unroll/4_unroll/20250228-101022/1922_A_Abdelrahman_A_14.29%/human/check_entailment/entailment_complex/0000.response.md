Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`tests`) and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the strings (`slength`), and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. The logic inside the loop checks if `c` is identical to `a` or `b`. If it is, it immediately prints "NO" because `a` and `b` would also match the same template, violating the requirement that only `a` and `b` should match the template.
4. If `c` is not identical to `a` or `b`, it then checks each character in `c` to see if it is present in either `a` or `b`. If every character in `c` is found in either `a` or `b`, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".
5. The logic ensures that for a template to exist, `c` must have at least one character that is not in both `a` and `b`.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function appears to be correct and aligns with the requirements specified.

Correctness: **True**
