Output State: **`tests` is an integer input between 1 and 1000, inclusive.**

The code `tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tests`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), the same condition applies to `tests` after executing the code. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
