Output State: The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each test case, if character `c` is found in either `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if every character in `c` is present in either `a` or `b`. If any character in `c` is not found in both `a` and `b`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This process repeats for each of the `tests` inputs.
