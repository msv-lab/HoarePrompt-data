Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Matching Conditions**: The program checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, it prints "NO", which is correct. However, this only covers one part of the problem. It should also check if both `a` and `b` match some template while `c` does not.

2. **Incomplete Logic for Template Matching**: The program should iterate through each character of `a`, `b`, and `c` to construct a template. If both `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not, it should print "YES". If not, it should print "NO".

3. **Early Exit**: The program breaks out of the loop as soon as it finds a character in `c` that is not in `a` or `b`, which is not sufficient. It needs to ensure that the characters in `a` and `b` can form a valid template and that `c` does not match this template.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        
        # Check if c is equal to a or b
        if c == a or c == b:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Construct the template
        template = ''
        for i in range(slength):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template += a[i].upper()  # Both a and b have the same character
            elif a[i] != b[i]:
                template += '?'
        
        # Check if c matches the template
        if any(template[j].islower() and c[j] == template[j] or
               template[j].isupper() and c[j].lower() == template[j].lower() for j in range(slength)):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version constructs the template by comparing `a` and `b` and ensures that `c` does not match the constructed template.
