Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where for each test case, it receives an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters). It then performs some operations based on these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**

Note: The actual operations and return values are not specified in the given information, so the functionality focuses on the parameters and their constraints.
