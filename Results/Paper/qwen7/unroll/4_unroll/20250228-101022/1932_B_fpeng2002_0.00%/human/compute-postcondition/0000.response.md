Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. The initial conditions for `t` and the subsequent values of `n` and `a_i` remain unchanged and are only processed later in the program.
