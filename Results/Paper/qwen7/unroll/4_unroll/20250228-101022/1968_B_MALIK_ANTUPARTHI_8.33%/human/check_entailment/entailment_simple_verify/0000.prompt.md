You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = input()
        e = input()
        k = 0
        for j in range(b):
            if d[j] in e[k:]:
                k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
                if k == c or j == b - 1:
                    k = j + 1
                    break
            else:
                k = j
                break
        print(k)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. a and b are binary strings of lengths n and m respectively. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and similarly, the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, a is an input integer, b and c are integers obtained from user input, d and e are strings obtained from user input, k is an integer initialized to 0 and updated within the loop based on conditions.
    #
    #In each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `i`), the value of `k` is updated based on the comparison between characters of strings `d` and `e`. The final value of `k` for each iteration is printed. The initial values of `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `k` are determined by user input during each iteration of the outer loop. The value of `a` controls the number of times the outer loop runs. After all iterations of the outer loop have finished, the final state of `k` for each iteration will be the last printed value of `k` for that particular iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum prefix length of string `a` that is a subsequence of string `b`. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the character found in `d` is not followed by another instance of the same character in `e`, which leads to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
5 4
10011
1110
3 3
100
110
1 3
1
111
```

The expected output is:
```
2
2
1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
2
2
0
```

In the last test case, the program incorrectly returns 0 because it does not properly update the index `k` when it finds a character in `d` that is not followed by another instance of the same character in `e`. This causes the loop to prematurely terminate, leading to an incorrect result.
