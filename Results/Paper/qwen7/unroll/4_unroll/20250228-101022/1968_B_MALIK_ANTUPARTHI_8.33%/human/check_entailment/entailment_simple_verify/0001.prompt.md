You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, a is an input integer, b and c are integers obtained from user input, d and e are strings obtained from user input, k is an integer initialized to 0 and updated within the loop based on conditions.
    #
    #In each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `i`), the value of `k` is updated based on the comparison between characters of strings `d` and `e`. The final value of `k` for each iteration is printed. The initial values of `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `k` are determined by user input during each iteration of the outer loop. The value of `a` controls the number of times the outer loop runs. After all iterations of the outer loop have finished, the final state of `k` for each iteration will be the last printed value of `k` for that particular iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` representing the lengths of strings `d` and `e` respectively.
   - It then reads the binary strings `d` and `e`.

2. **Finding Subsequence:**
   - The program initializes a counter `k` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character of string `d`.
   - For each character `d[j]`, it checks if this character exists in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end.
   - If found, it updates `k` to the index of the found character plus one (`e.index(d[j]) + 1`).
   - If `k` reaches the length of `e` or the loop completes without breaking, it increments `k` by `j + 1` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the character `d[j]` is not found in the remaining part of `e`, it sets `k` to `j` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all characters of `d`, it prints the value of `k`.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Subsequence:**
   - The current logic tries to find the exact position of each character in `d` within the remaining part of `e`. This approach is flawed because it doesn't ensure that the characters are in the same order as in `d`.
   - For example, consider the input:
     ```
     1
     5 4
     10011
     1110
     ```
     The program will find `1` at index 0 in `1110`, then `0` at index 1, and `1` at index 2. However, `100` is not a subsequence of `1110` because the order is not maintained.

2. **Improper Handling of Subsequence Order:**
   - The program should maintain the order of characters while checking for subsequences. It should keep track of the positions in `e` where characters from `d` appear, ensuring they are in the correct order.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = input()
        e = input()
        k = 0
        for j in range(b):
            found = False
            for l in range(k, c):
                if d[j] == e[l]:
                    k = l + 1
                    found = True
                    break
            if not found:
                break
        print(k)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Finding Subsequence:**
   - For each character `d[j]`, the program starts searching from index `k` in `e`.
   - It iterates through the remaining part of `e` to find the character `d[j]`.
   - If found, it updates `k` to the next index after the found character.
   - If not found, it breaks out of the loop.

This ensures that the characters are checked in the correct order and maintains the subsequence requirement.

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for finding the subsequence. The corrected program addresses this issue by properly maintaining the order of characters while checking for subsequences.
