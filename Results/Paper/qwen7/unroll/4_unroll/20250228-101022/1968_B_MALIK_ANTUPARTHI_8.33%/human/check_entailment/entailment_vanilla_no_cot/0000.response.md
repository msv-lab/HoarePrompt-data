Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has an issue with how it checks if a character from string `d` (string `a`) is a subsequence in string `e` (string `b`). The current logic tries to find the index of the character in the remaining part of string `e` starting from `k`, but it doesn't correctly handle cases where the character might appear multiple times in `e`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = input()
        e = input()
        k = 0
        for j in range(b):
            found = False
            for l in range(k, c):
                if d[j] == e[l]:
                    k = l + 1
                    found = True
                    break
            if not found:
                break
        print(k)

func()
```

### Explanation of the corrections:
1. **Nested Loop for Subsequence Check**: Instead of using `e.index()`, which only finds the first occurrence, we use a nested loop to check each character in `d` against the remaining part of `e` starting from `k`. This ensures that we correctly account for multiple occurrences of characters in `e`.
2. **Break on Failure**: If a character in `d` is not found in the remaining part of `e`, the loop breaks, and the current value of `k` is printed.
3. **Increment `k` Properly**: When a character is found, `k` is incremented properly to move to the next position in `e`.

This corrected version should accurately determine the maximum length `k` such that the first `k` characters of `d` form a subsequence of `e`.
