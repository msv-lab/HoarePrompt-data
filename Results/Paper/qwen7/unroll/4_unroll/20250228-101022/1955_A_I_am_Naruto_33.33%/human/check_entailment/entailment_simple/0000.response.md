Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It calculates two possible costs:
   - `ans1 = a * n`: The cost if each yogurt is bought individually at the regular price.
   - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`: The cost if the maximum number of pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotional price, and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price.
4. It prints the minimum of these two costs.
5. The logic for handling the case when `n == 1` is also correctly implemented by directly printing `a`.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.

Correctness: **True**
