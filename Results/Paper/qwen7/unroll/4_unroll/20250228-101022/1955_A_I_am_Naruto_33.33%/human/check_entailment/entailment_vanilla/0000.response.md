Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variables Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.
3. **Single Yogurt Purchase Check**: If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `a`, which is the correct price for one yogurt.
4. **Promotion Calculation**: If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible total costs:
   - `ans1`: The cost if each yogurt is bought at the regular price (`a * n`).
   - `ans2`: The cost if the maximum number of pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotion price, and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price (`b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`).
5. **Minimum Cost Selection**: The program then prints the minimum of these two calculated values, which is the correct approach to minimize the total cost.

Given the logic and the calculations performed, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

**Conclusion:**
- The program handles all edge cases (e.g., when `n` is 1).
- It correctly calculates the minimum cost using both the regular price and the promotion price.
- The logic for choosing between the two pricing methods is sound.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
