Output State: **T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4.**

The code `T = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` (which is equivalent to `T` in this context) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the same condition applies to `T` after the code is executed. The values of `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
