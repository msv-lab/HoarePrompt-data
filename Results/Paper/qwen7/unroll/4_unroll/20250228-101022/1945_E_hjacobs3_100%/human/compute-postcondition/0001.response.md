Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n; `l` is 0; `r` is n.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `l` and `r` to 0 and `n` respectively. Since `n` is the length of the `array`, `l` and `r` are set to the start and end indices of the array. The state of the `array` remains unchanged.
