Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem description, the goal is to minimize the number of cards by exchanging groups of `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` new cards. However, the program simply prints `k - 1` without considering the actual distribution of card numbers.

For instance, consider the input:
```
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```
The expected output should be `2`, as we can exchange the three `4`s for two new cards. However, the program will output `2 - 1 = 1`, which is incorrect.

Another example is:
```
7 2
4 2 1 100 5 2 3
```
The expected output here is `1`, as we can exchange all pairs of cards with the same number, leaving only one card. But the program will output `2 - 1 = 1`, which is correct in this case but does not handle the general logic of minimizing the number of cards.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description.
