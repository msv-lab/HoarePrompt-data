Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), followed by pairs of integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100), and a list of n integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100). It then prints k - 1 for each test case, resulting in t lines of output, each containing a single integer which is k - 1.**
