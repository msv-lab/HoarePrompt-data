Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it accepts three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (with 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9). For each set of `n`, `a`, and `b`, it performs some operation and returns a result based on the input values.**

Given the constraints and the lack of specific operations mentioned in the output, the function likely iterates over `t` test cases, taking `n`, `a`, and `b` as inputs for each case, and then returns a result for each case based on these inputs. However, without more specific details on the operations, the exact nature of the return value cannot be precisely described.
