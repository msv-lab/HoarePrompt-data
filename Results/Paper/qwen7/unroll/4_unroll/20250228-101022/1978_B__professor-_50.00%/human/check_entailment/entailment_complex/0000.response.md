Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided function step-by-step to ensure it correctly computes the maximum profit for each test case.

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. It then iterates over each test case, reading `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: If `b <= a`, the function prints `n * a`. This is because selling all buns at the usual price `a` would yield the maximum profit since the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`.
   - **Case 2**: If `b - a >= n`, the function prints \(\frac{(2 * b - n + 1) * n}{2}\). This formula represents the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - (n-1)`, which simplifies to the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
   - **Case 3**: Otherwise, the function prints \(\frac{(b - a) * (b - a + 1)}{2} + a * n\). This formula combines the sum of the first `b - a` natural numbers (which is the sum of the modified prices) with the usual price `a` for the remaining buns.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the logic appears to be correct. The function handles all possible scenarios as described:

- When `b <= a`, selling all buns at the usual price `a` is optimal.
- When `b - a >= n`, selling the first `n` buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price `a` is optimal.
- Otherwise, selling the first `b - a + 1` buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price `a` is optimal.

Since the function correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement and the provided examples match the expected outputs, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
