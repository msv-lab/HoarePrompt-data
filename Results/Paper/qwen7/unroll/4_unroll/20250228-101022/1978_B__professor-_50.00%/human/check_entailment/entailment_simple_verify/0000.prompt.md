You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed as a result of the loop's execution. For each test case specified by the initial integer `t`, the output will depend on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for that particular test case. If `b <= a`, it will print `n * a`. If `b - a >= n`, it will print the value of \(\frac{(2 * b - n + 1) * n}{2}\). Otherwise, it will print the value of \(\frac{(b - a) * (b - a + 1)}{2} + a * n\).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where `b` is greater than `a` but less than `n`. Let's analyze the given logic:

1. **Case 1**: When `b <= a`, the program correctly prints `n * a`.
2. **Case 2**: When `b - a >= n`, the program correctly calculates the profit using the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`.
3. **Case 3**: For other cases, the program uses the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.

However, the formula used in Case 3 is incorrect. It does not account for the fact that the modified price decreases linearly from `b` to `a + 1` for the first `k` buns. A correct approach would involve summing up the arithmetic series for the first `k` buns and then adding the usual price for the remaining `n - k` buns.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 7`

According to the problem description:
- Selling the first `k` buns at prices `7, 6, 5` (if `k = 3`).
- Selling the remaining `n - k` buns at `5` coins each.

The maximum profit is obtained by selling all buns at the modified prices:
\[ 7 + 6 + 5 = 18 \]

However, the program calculates:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{int}((7 - 5) / 2 * (7 - 5 + 1) + 5 * 3) = \text{int}(2 / 2 * 3 + 15) = \text{int}(3 + 15) = 18 \]

This calculation seems correct in this specific case, but let's consider another case to ensure the general correctness:
- Input: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 6`

According to the problem description:
- Selling the first `k` buns at prices `6, 5` (if `k = 2`).
- Selling the remaining `n - k` buns at `5` coins each.

The maximum profit is obtained by selling all buns at the modified prices:
\[ 6 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 21 \]

However, the program calculates:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{int}((6 - 5) / 2 * (6 - 5 + 1) + 5 * 4) = \text{int}(1 / 2 * 2 + 20) = \text{int}(1 + 20) = 21 \]

This calculation is also correct in this specific case. However, the general formula needs to be validated for all possible values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Given the complexity and the need for a more precise formula, the provided solution is not fully correct. Therefore, the program is marked as **False**.
