#State of the program right berfore the function call: extroverts is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, and universals is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals. The function returns the minimum number of tents required for the extroverts and universals to be accommodated according to their preferences, or None if it is impossible to accommodate them.
def func_1(extroverts, universals):
    if (extroverts % 3 != 0) :
        if (extroverts % 3 + universals < 3) :
            return None
            #The program returns None
        #State: `extroverts` is a non-negative integer, `universals` is a non-negative integer, and the number of `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, and the minimum number of tents required cannot be determined with the current conditions (i.e., the number of `extroverts` modulo 3 plus `universals` is greater than or equal to 3)
    #State: Postcondition: `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers. If the number of `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `extroverts` modulo 3 and `universals` is greater than or equal to 3, then the minimum number of tents required cannot be determined. Otherwise, the minimum number of tents required is returned.
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    #The program returns the ceiling value of (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, given that extroverts and universals are non-negative integers and the conditions about divisibility and sum do not prevent a determination of the minimum number of tents required.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, both non-negative integers. It returns the minimum number of tents required for the extroverts and universals to be accommodated according to their preferences, or `None` if it is impossible to accommodate them. Specifically, if the number of `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `extroverts` modulo 3 and `universals` is greater than or equal to 3, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals)` divided by 3.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: introverts is a non-negative integer representing the number of introverts, extroverts is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, and universals is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals.
def func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals):
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
    #The program returns `introverts` plus the return value of `func_1(extroverts, universals)` if `func_1(extroverts, universals)` does not return `None`, otherwise it returns `-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters (`introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`) and returns the sum of `introverts` and the result of calling `func_1(extroverts, universals)`. If `func_1(extroverts, universals)` returns `None`, the function returns `-1`.
