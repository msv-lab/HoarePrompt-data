### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function takes `extroverts` and `universals` as input.
   - It checks if `extroverts % 3 == 0`. If not, it further checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3`.
     - If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it returns `None` indicating it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals.
     - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`.
   - The logic is sound because:
     - Extroverts need to be grouped in sets of 3, and any remaining extroverts can be paired with universals.
     - If the remaining extroverts plus universals are less than 3, it's impossible to form complete groups of 3.
     - The ceiling division ensures we account for any remaining individuals who cannot form a full group of 3.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function takes `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` as input.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` and:
     - Returns `-1` if `func_1` returns `None`.
     - Otherwise, it returns `introverts + func_1(extroverts, universals)`.
   - The logic is sound because:
     - Introverts need individual tents, so the number of tents for introverts is simply `introverts`.
     - The result from `func_1` gives the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals combined.
     - Adding these together gives the total number of tents required.

3. **Overall Program Analysis:**
   - The program iterates over test cases, calling `func_2` with the appropriate inputs.
   - The logic correctly handles all edge cases and follows the problem statement.
   - The examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
