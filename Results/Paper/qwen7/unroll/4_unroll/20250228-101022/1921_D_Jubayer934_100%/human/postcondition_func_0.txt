The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads integers n and m, along with two lists a and b. It then sorts list a in ascending order and list b in descending order. The function calculates the sum of absolute differences between the first n smallest elements of list a and the first m largest elements of list b. If a certain condition is met during the calculation, it adjusts the result accordingly. Finally, it prints the computed sum for each test case.
