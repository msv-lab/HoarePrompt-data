Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. After executing the loop, ans is a list of integers representing the sum of absolute differences between the first n elements of the sorted list a and either the corresponding elements or mirrored elements from the first m elements of the sorted list b, depending on a specific condition.
