Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and then reads `n` integers for array `a` and `m` integers for array `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - It sorts array `a` in ascending order.
   - It sorts array `b` in descending order.

3. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes `temp` to `-1` and `ans` as an empty list.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - It iterates through the first `n` elements of `b` and pairs them with the corresponding elements of `a`.
   - For each element in `a`, it calculates the absolute difference with the corresponding element in `b` and appends it to `ans`.
   - It checks if swapping the current element of `a` with the last element of `b` (to maximize the difference) would yield a larger difference than the current one. If so, it updates `temp` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Adjusting Differences:**
   - If `temp` is updated, it means there was a better way to pair the elements to maximize the differences.
   - It then adjusts the remaining elements of `a` by pairing them with the appropriate elements from the end of `b`.

6. **Calculating and Printing Result:**
   - Finally, it sums up all the differences stored in `ans` and prints the result.

### Correctness Check

1. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - Sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order ensures that we are maximizing the differences between the smallest elements of `a` and the largest elements of `b`.

2. **Pairing Elements:**
   - The logic of checking if swapping the current element of `a` with the last element of `b` (to maximize the difference) is correct. However, the implementation of this logic is flawed. The program should compare the differences directly without breaking the loop prematurely.

3. **Adjusting Differences:**
   - After determining the best initial pairing, the program correctly adjusts the remaining elements to ensure the maximum difference.

4. **Summing Differences:**
   - Summing up the differences and printing the result is correct.

### Issue Identified

The issue lies in the loop where the program checks if swapping the current element of `a` with the last element of `b` would yield a larger difference. The current implementation breaks the loop prematurely, which might not always yield the optimal solution.

### Corrected Approach

The corrected approach should involve comparing the differences directly and ensuring the optimal pairing without breaking the loop prematurely.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the current implementation is not entirely correct due to the premature loop break. Therefore, the program needs to be revised to ensure it correctly maximizes the differences.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
