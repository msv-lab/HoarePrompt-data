Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `times`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `times` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State**: The current state is given as `times` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and `check` is 2147483647.

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `times` is greater than 0. The value of `check` does not affect the loop condition and can remain as it is.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `times` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`times` must be greater than 0, check is 2147483647**
