You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

    #State: Output State: `times` is the number of test cases; for each test case, `check` is 2147483647, and `ans` is the count of elements in the data list that do not have their bitwise XOR with `check` present in the dictionary `dic`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to divide a set of integers into the minimum number of groups such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value in any of the 31 least significant bits.

2. **Key Insight**: Two numbers will have different bits in the 31 least significant positions if their bitwise XOR with `2^31 - 1` (which is `111...111` in binary, a 31-bit number with all bits set to 1) results in a unique value. This is because `2^31 - 1` flips all bits of a number.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program initializes `times` to read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the number of integers, and the integers themselves.
   - It uses a dictionary `dic` to keep track of the count of unique XOR results.
   - For each integer `i`, it computes `s = i ^ check` where `check` is `2^31 - 1`.
   - If `i` is already in the dictionary, it decrements its count and removes it if the count reaches zero.
   - Otherwise, it increments the count of `s` in the dictionary and increments the answer counter `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly identifies unique XOR results which represent the unique combination of bits in the 31 least significant positions.
   - The dictionary ensures that each unique combination is counted only once, and the answer counter `ans` tracks the number of groups needed.
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by resetting the dictionary and counter at the start of each new test case.

Given this analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the required logic.

Correctness: **True**
