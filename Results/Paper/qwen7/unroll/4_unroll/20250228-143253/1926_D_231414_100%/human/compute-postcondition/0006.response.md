Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of subsequent test cases, then for each of these test cases, it reads another positive integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers. It calculates the count of elements in the list that do not have their bitwise XOR with `2^31 - 1` present in a dictionary. Finally, it prints the count for each test case.**
