Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is updated to the value of `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input provided is a positive integer.

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Given that `t` is initially an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive), and it is updated to the value of `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input provided results in a positive integer.

4. **Formulate the final state**: We need to adjust the state such that the loop can execute. This means ensuring that `t` is a positive integer after the input is taken.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `t` is a positive integer after the input is taken.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive)**

This ensures that the loop condition (`t > 0`) is satisfied, allowing the loop to execute.
