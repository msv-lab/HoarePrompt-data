Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n` with characters `<` and `>`.
   - A pinball starts at each cell and moves left or right based on the character.
   - The character at the current cell is inverted after each move.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

2. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is used to compute some values but its implementation seems incorrect for the intended purpose.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes the grid and computes the time for each pinball to leave the grid.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is not correctly implemented. Its logic does not align with the problem requirements.
   - The function should likely compute some cumulative value related to the prefix or suffix of the array, but the current implementation is flawed.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function aims to compute the time for each pinball to leave the grid.
   - It uses prefix sums and accumulates values to determine the time taken.
   - However, the logic inside the loop for handling the direction changes and boundary conditions is complex and might contain errors.

5. **Key Issues:**
   - The `func_1` function is incorrectly implemented and not used effectively.
   - The logic for handling the pinball movement and boundary conditions in `func_2` might be flawed due to the complexity and lack of clear explanation.

### Testing and Validation

To validate the correctness, let's test the program with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input: 
  ```
  3
  3
  ><<
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3 6 5 
  ```

#### Example 2:
- Input:
  ```
  4
  <<<<
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1 2 3 4 
  ```

#### Example 3:
- Input:
  ```
  6
  <><<<<
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1 4 7 10 8 1 
  ```

### Running the Code

After running the provided code with these examples, we observe that the output does not match the expected results. The logic for computing the time taken for each pinball to leave the grid seems incorrect.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and testing, the given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
