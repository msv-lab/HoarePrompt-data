### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves simulating the movement of a pinball on a grid where each cell contains either '<' or '>'. The pinball moves left or right based on the direction indicated by the cell and the direction is then reversed. The goal is to calculate how long it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function seems to be calculating the difference in positions of the pinball at two different times. However, the logic here appears to be incorrect because it uses `max(-l, -1 - times)` which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. The function should be calculating the position of the pinball at a specific time relative to the current time.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly handles the calculation of the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid. It uses prefix sums and suffix sums to efficiently compute the required values. The logic for handling the '<' and '>' characters and updating the answers is correct.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The main issue lies in `func_1`. The function `func_1` is incorrectly implemented and does not serve the purpose intended. It should be replaced with a correct implementation that calculates the position of the pinball at a given time.
   - The overall logic in `func_2` is sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Given that `func_1` is incorrectly implemented and crucial for the correctness of the program, the program as a whole is not correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
