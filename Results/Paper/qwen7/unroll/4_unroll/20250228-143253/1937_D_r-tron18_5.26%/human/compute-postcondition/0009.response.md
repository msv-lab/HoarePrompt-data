Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `s1`, which is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n`, which is the length of the string `s1`. The function returns a value based on the balance of '<' and '>' characters in the string `s1`.**

This means the function checks the balance of '<' and '>' characters in the string `s1` and returns a value accordingly, given that the string length `n` is within the specified range.
