Output State: **`c` is 0, `g` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree, `l` is 1, `r` is `n // k`**.

In this output state, the variable `c` remains unchanged at 0, `g` retains its original structure as a list of length `n + 1` with each element being a list of neighbors, `l` stays at 1, and `r` is now assigned the value of `n // k`.
