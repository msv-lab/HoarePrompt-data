Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum cost to travel between any two cities.
   - The cost to travel directly between two cities \(x\) and \(y\) is \(|a_x - a_y|\).
   - The cost to travel to the closest city is always 1 coin.
   - The closest city to a city \(i\) is unique and can be found using the `func_1` function.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities, their positions, and the number of queries.
   - It then calculates the "forward" and "backward" distances to the closest city using the `func_1` function.
   - It computes prefix sums for these distances.
   - Finally, it processes each query to determine the minimum cost to travel between the given cities.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the distance to the closest city for each city.
   - It iterates through each city and determines the closer of the two neighboring cities.
   - If the forward city is closer, it sets the value to 1 (cost to travel to the closest city); otherwise, it sets it to the distance to the forward city.

4. **Prefix Sums:**
   - Prefix sums are calculated for both forward and backward distances.
   - These are used to quickly compute the sum of distances for any range of cities.

5. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the code uses the prefix sums to find the minimum cost.
   - If the starting city index is less than the ending city index, it uses the forward prefix sum; otherwise, it uses the backward prefix sum.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge cases where the starting and ending indices are reversed correctly by using the appropriate prefix sum array.

7. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic for finding the closest city and calculating the prefix sums seems correct.
   - The query processing logic also appears to be correct, using the appropriate prefix sums.

Given the analysis, the provided code seems to correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
