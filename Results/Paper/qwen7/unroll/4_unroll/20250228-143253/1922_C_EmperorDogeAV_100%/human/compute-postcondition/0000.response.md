Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `prog_cities` with `n-1` elements, all set to 0. The original list `cities` remains unchanged. Therefore, `cities` still represents the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, and `prog_cities` is a list of `n-1` zeros.
