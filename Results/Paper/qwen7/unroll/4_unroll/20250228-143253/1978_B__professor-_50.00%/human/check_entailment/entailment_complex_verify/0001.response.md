### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the provided problem description and examples.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if `b` is less than or equal to `a`. If true, it prints `n * a` because the best strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price.
   - If `b` is greater than `a`, it further checks if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`. If true, it calculates the profit using the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`.
   - Otherwise, it uses the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` to calculate the profit.

3. **Formulas Explanation:**
   - When `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, the profit is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - n + 1`. This is derived from the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence.
   - When `b > a` and `b - a < n`, the profit is calculated by considering the first `k` buns sold at the modified price and the rest at the usual price.

#### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - Output: `17`
   - Here, `b - a = 1` which is less than `n = 4`. So, the optimal choice is to sell the first `k = 1` bun at `5` coins and the rest at `4` coins each. Thus, the profit is `5 + 4*3 = 17`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `5 5 9`
   - Output: `35`
   - Here, `b - a = 4` which is greater than `n = 5`. So, the optimal choice is to sell all 5 buns at the modified prices, giving a profit of `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35`.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `10 10 5`
   - Output: `100`
   - Here, `b - a = 5` which is greater than `n = 10`. So, the optimal choice is to sell all 10 buns at the usual price, giving a profit of `10 * 10 = 100`.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `5 5 11`
   - Output: `45`
   - Here, `b - a = 6` which is greater than `n = 5`. So, the optimal choice is to sell all 5 buns at the modified prices, giving a profit of `11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45`.

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000`
   - Here, `b = a`, so the profit is `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.

6. **Example 6:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000`
   - Here, `b - a = 999999999` which is much greater than `n = 1000000000`. So, the optimal choice is to sell all 1000000000 buns at the modified price, giving a profit of `1000000000 * 1 = 1000000000000000000`.

7. **Example 7:**
   - Input: `1000 1 1000`
   - Output: `500500`
   - Here, `b - a = 999` which is less than `n = 1000`. So, the optimal choice is to sell the first `k = 999` buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price, giving a profit of `999 + 998 + ... + 2 + 1 + 1000 * (1000 - 999) = 500500`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the profit based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
