Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers, each corresponding to the result of one iteration of the loop. The number of integers in the output state will be equal to the value of `t`. Each integer is calculated based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case, following the conditions specified in the loop body.
