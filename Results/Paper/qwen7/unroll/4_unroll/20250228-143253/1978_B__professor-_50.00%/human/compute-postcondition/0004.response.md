Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it takes three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (with 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9) as inputs and returns a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It processes these inputs for each test case and returns a result accordingly, though the specific result is not detailed in the given information.
