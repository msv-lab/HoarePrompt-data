Reasoning:
1. **Case 1: \( b \leq a \)**
   - According to the problem, if \( b \leq a \), Bob should sell all buns at the usual price \( a \). This is correctly handled by the code with `print(n * a)`.

2. **Case 2: \( b - a \geq n \)**
   - Here, Bob should sell the first \( n \) buns at the modified prices, which form an arithmetic sequence starting from \( b \) down to \( b - n + 1 \). The sum of the first \( n \) terms of this sequence is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \( S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (2b - n + 1) \).
   - The code correctly calculates this with `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`.

3. **Case 3: \( b - a < n \)**
   - In this case, Bob should sell the first \( b - a + 1 \) buns at the modified prices, forming an arithmetic sequence from \( b \) down to \( b - (b - a) \), and the remaining \( n - (b - a + 1) \) buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - The sum of the first \( b - a + 1 \) terms of this sequence is given by \( S_{b-a+1} = \frac{(b - a + 1)}{2} \times (2b - (b - a) + 1) = \frac{(b - a + 1)}{2} \times (b - a + 2) \).
   - The total profit is then the sum of this sequence plus the usual price for the remaining buns: \( \text{Profit} = \frac{(b - a + 1) \times (b - a + 2)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a)) \).
   - The code correctly implements this with `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.

Given that the code handles all the specified conditions correctly according to the problem statement, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
