Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, a is an integer input by the user, each iteration of the outer loop modifies variable `k` based on the conditions given, and the final value of `k` for each iteration is printed. The final state of `k` after all iterations of the loop will be the last value printed.
