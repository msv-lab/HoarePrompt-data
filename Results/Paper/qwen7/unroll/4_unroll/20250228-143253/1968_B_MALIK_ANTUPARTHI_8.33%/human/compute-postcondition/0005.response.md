Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers n and m, followed by two binary strings a and b. It then finds the first occurrence of string a within string b (considering overlaps) and prints the starting index of this occurrence. If no such occurrence exists, it prints the length of string a. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with the final output consisting of indices for each test case.**
