The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads values for n, k, P_B, P_S, a permutation p, and an array a. It then calculates scores for two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on specific rules involving the elements of p and a. Finally, it prints the result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') for each test case based on the comparison of the calculated scores.
