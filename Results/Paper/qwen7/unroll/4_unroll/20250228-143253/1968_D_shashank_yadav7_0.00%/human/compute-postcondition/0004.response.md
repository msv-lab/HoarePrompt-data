Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a set of inputs including a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by t test cases. Each test case includes positive integers n, k, P_B, P_S (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), a permutation p of length n, and an array a of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i. For each test case, it returns a result based on the given inputs.**
