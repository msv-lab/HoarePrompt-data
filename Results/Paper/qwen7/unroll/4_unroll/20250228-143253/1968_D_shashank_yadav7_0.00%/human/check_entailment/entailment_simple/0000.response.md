Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the necessary inputs: `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
3. The program converts the starting positions `P_B` and `P_S` to zero-based indices by subtracting 1.
4. It initializes scores for Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`) based on their initial positions.
5. The program then iterates up to `k` times, updating the positions and scores for both players based on the rules of the game.
6. After the loop, it compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function seems to correctly simulate the game according to the rules provided. The program handles the game logic and scoring correctly, and the output matches the expected results based on the examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
