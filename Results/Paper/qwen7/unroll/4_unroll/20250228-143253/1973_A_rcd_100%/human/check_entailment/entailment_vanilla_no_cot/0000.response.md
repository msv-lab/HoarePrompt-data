Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Handling of Draw Conditions**: The logic for determining the maximum number of draws is not correctly implemented. The current approach does not accurately calculate the maximum number of draws that could have occurred.

2. **Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle all edge cases properly. For instance, it incorrectly prints `-1` in some scenarios where a valid solution exists.

3. **Logic Flaws**: The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is flawed. Specifically, the while loop condition and the way `x` and `y` are incremented/decremented do not correctly reflect the scoring system.

### Correct Solution:
Hereâ€™s a revised version of the function that correctly calculates the maximum number of draws:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Check if the total score is even
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the total points
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        # If p3 is greater than or equal to p1 + p2, it's impossible to achieve the scores
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        max_draws = 0
        for x in range(p1 + 1):  # x is the number of games won by the first player
            for y in range(p2 + 1):  # y is the number of games won by the second player
                z = (total_points - 2 * (x + y)) // 2  # z is the number of games won by the third player
                if x + y + z == p3 and x + y + z == (p1 + p2 + p3) / 2:
                    max_draws = max(max_draws, x + y)
        
        print(max_draws)

func()
```

This solution iterates through all possible combinations of wins and draws for each player to find the maximum number of draws that can result in the given scores.
