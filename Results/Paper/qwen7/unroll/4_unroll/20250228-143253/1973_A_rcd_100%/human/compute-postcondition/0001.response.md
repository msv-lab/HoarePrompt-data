State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(t)` to determine how many times it will iterate.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The initial state of `t` being an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, does not guarantee that the loop will execute if `t` is 0 or negative.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is ensuring `t` is greater than 0.
