You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0
            y = p3
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                    print(p1 - x + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    x += 1
                    y -= 1
            else:
                print(p3)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a positive integer `t` and then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. It checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`. If the sum is even and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`. If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, it attempts to find integers `x` and `y` such that `p1 - x` equals `p2 - y` and `p3`. If such integers exist, it prints `p1 - x + p3`; otherwise, it prints `p3`. After processing all test cases, it outputs a series of integers or `-1` based on the conditions described.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. If not, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is because the total points must be even since each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 1 point to each player in a draw.

3. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`. If true, it prints `p1 + p2`, which is the maximum possible number of draws. This condition ensures that the highest score (`p3`) can be achieved by drawing all games with the other two players.

4. **Iterative Calculation:**
   - If the above condition is not met, the program enters an iterative loop where it tries to find the maximum number of draws.
     - It initializes `x` and `y` such that `x` represents the number of draws involving the first player and `y` represents the number of draws involving the second player.
     - The loop continues as long as `y >= x`.
     - In each iteration, it checks if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`. If true, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop. This means the current configuration of draws is valid.
     - If not, it increments `x` and decrements `y` and continues the loop.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the scores are inconsistent or where no valid configuration exists. Specifically, it does not check if the scores can be achieved through a combination of wins and draws.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Handling Inconsistent Scores:**
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the scores cannot be achieved through any valid combination of games and results. For example, the scores `1 1 10` should return `-1`, but the program does not check this condition properly.

2. **Complexity and Efficiency:**
   - The iterative approach in the loop might not be efficient for large values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, especially when the scores are inconsistent.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not ensure that the scores are achievable through valid games and results. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

Correctness: **False**
