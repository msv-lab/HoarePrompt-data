Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers or -1, depending on the input values for each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the output will be -1. Otherwise, if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the output will be `p1 + p2`. If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the loop will attempt to find integers `x` and `y` such that `p1 - x` equals `p2 - y` and `p3`, and will output `p1 - x + p3` if such integers exist. If no such integers exist, the output will be `p3`.
