Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of cards remaining after performing operations that involve exchanging groups of \(k\) cards with the same number for \(k-1\) new cards. The goal is to minimize the number of cards left.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If \(k > n\), we cannot perform any exchanges, so the minimum number of cards is \(n\).
   - If \(k == n\), we can exchange all cards for \(k-1\) cards, so the result is \(k-1\).
   - For other cases, we need to consider the frequency of each card number and ensure that no number's count exceeds \(k\).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the base cases where \(k > n\) and \(k == n\).
   - The `func_1` function calculates the frequency of each card number but caps the count at \(k\) if it exceeds \(k\).
   - After calling `func_1`, the program checks if any number's count is exactly \(k\). If so, it prints \(k-1\) because we can exchange \(k\) cards for \(k-1\). Otherwise, it prints \(n\) because no further exchanges are possible.

4. **Edge Cases and Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly updates the frequency table to cap counts at \(k\).
   - The main program logic is correct in handling the different scenarios and using the results from `func_1`.

Given the analysis, the program appears to handle all specified cases correctly according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
