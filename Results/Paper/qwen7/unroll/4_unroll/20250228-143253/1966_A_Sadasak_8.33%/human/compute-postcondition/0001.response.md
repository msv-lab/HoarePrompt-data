Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `num` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `arr`. The variable `num` will take the value of each element in `arr` during each iteration.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards.
   - `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 100\).
   - `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over each element in `arr`, the initial state of `arr` should be preserved.
   - The variable `num` will be assigned the value of each element in `arr` during each iteration, but its initial value before the loop starts is not relevant because it will change with each iteration.
   - The variable `k` is not used within the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted.
   - The `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary initially, and it will be modified inside the loop, but its initial state is correct as it is empty.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the list `arr` to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will start with the first element of `arr` and continue until all elements are processed.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards**, and `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.
