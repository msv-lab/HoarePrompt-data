Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations, where each operation can either permute the rows or columns.
2. The provided code does not actually perform any row or column permutations. Instead, it calculates a sum based on a mathematical formula and prints a fixed number of operations (always \( 2n \)) without performing any actual permutations.
3. The sum calculation in the provided code is incorrect and does not relate to the problem's requirements. The formula used in the sum calculation does not reflect the logic needed to maximize the sum of the matrix elements through row and column permutations.
4. The output format for the operations is incorrect because it does not involve any actual permutations of the rows or columns.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
