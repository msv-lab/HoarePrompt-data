Output State: t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. After executing the loop, for each input integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500), the sum is calculated based on the given formula and printed along with n + n. Additionally, two patterns are printed for each n, consisting of lines with specific sequences of numbers.
