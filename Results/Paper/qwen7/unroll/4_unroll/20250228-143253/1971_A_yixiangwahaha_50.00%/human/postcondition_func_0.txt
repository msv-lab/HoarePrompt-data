The function reads an integer `t` and two lists of integers `x` and `y` from the input. It then compares the corresponding elements of `x` and `y` and prints 10 lines, each containing two integers. If the element in `x` is less than the corresponding element in `y`, it prints the element from `x` followed by the element from `y`. Otherwise, it prints the element from `y` followed by the element from `x`. The function does not return any value.
