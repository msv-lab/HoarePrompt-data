Reasoning:
- The problem requires processing multiple test cases, but the provided program only processes one set of 10 pairs of integers.
- The input format suggests that there should be multiple lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers, and the number of such lines is specified by the first input (integer `t`).
- The program currently only reads 10 pairs of integers and does not handle the `t` test cases properly.
- The program logic correctly identifies the minimum and maximum of each pair and prints them in the required format.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not process multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. It only handles a fixed number of 10 pairs instead of reading `t` pairs of integers.

Correctness: **False**
