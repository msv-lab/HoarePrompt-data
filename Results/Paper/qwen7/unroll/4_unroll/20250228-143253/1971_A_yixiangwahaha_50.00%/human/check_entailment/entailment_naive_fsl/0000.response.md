Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. According to the problem description, the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, and each subsequent line contains two space-separated integers `x` and `y`. However, the program assumes that there will always be exactly 10 test cases and reads 10 pairs of integers directly from the input, regardless of the actual value of `t`.

This means that if the input does not contain exactly 10 test cases, the program will either read extra data or stop prematurely, leading to incorrect results. For example, if the input is:

```
5
1 9
8 4
```

The program will process the first two test cases correctly but will then attempt to process two more test cases that do not exist, leading to undefined behavior.

To fix this, the program should read the number of test cases `t` first and then process exactly `t` pairs of integers.
