Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading `t`, which is supposed to be the number of test cases.
   - It then reads 10 pairs of integers (from `i` = 0 to `i` = 9) instead of `t` pairs. This is incorrect because it should read `t` pairs of integers, not a fixed number.

2. **Data Storage:**
   - The program stores the integers in lists `x` and `y`. However, since it reads only 10 pairs regardless of the value of `t`, this part will only work correctly if `t` is 10. If `t` is less than or greater than 10, the program will either read extra data or stop prematurely.

3. **Output Logic:**
   - For each pair, the program checks if `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`.
   - If true, it prints `x[i]` followed by `y[i]`.
   - If false, it prints `y[i]` followed by `x[i]`.
   - This logic is correct for determining the minimum and maximum of each pair.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem statement, the program should handle `t` test cases, where `t` can vary from 1 to 100. However, the current implementation reads exactly 10 pairs of integers, which means it will not work correctly for all possible values of `t`.

### Correctness:

Since the program does not correctly handle the variable number of test cases (`t`), the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
