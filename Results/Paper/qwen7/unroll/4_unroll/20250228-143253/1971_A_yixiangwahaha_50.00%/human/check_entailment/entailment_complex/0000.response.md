Reasoning:
- The problem description specifies that there are multiple test cases, and for each test case, we need to compare two integers \(x\) and \(y\), and print the minimum followed by the maximum.
- The annotated program incorrectly reads 10 pairs of integers instead of reading \(t\) pairs of integers, where \(t\) is the number of test cases.
- The program should iterate \(t\) times, not a fixed 10 times, to process each test case correctly.
- The logic inside the loop is correct; it compares \(x\) and \(y\) and prints the minimum followed by the maximum.

Given these points, the annotated program is incorrect because it processes a fixed number of test cases (10) instead of the variable number of test cases specified by \(t\).

Correctness: **False**
