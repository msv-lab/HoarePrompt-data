Output State: The output state will consist of 10 lines, each containing two integers separated by a space. For each iteration `i` from 0 to 9, if the value at index `i` in list `x` is less than the value at the same index in list `y`, it will print the value from `x` followed by the value from `y`. Otherwise, it will print the value from `y` followed by the value from `x`.
