Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and initializes `ans1` to 0.

2. **Finding the Maximum OR Value with `ans1`**:
   - It iterates from 1 to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_ans1 | p_i)` with `(p_ans1 | p_ans1)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `ans1` to `i`.

3. **Finding the Maximum OR Value with Updated `ans1`**:
   - Initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` to `[0]`.
   - Iterates from 1 to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_mx | p_i)` with `(p_ans1 | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it resets `v` to an empty list and updates `mx` to `i`, adding `i` to `v`.
   - If the result is `=`, it adds `i` to `v`.

4. **Selecting the Best Candidate**:
   - Sets `mx` to the first element of `v` and `ans` to the same element.
   - Iterates through the rest of the elements in `v` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_ans | p_ans)` with `(p_v[i] | p_v[i])`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `ans` to `v[i]`.

5. **Outputting the Result**:
   - Prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the result.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Query Format**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but never called with the correct parameters. The problem requires specific indices for the queries, but the function is not used correctly.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The logic for finding the maximum XOR value is flawed. The program attempts to find the maximum OR value first, which is not directly related to finding the maximum XOR value.
   - The approach of finding the maximum OR value and then selecting the best candidate does not guarantee finding the maximum XOR value.

3. **Query Count**:
   - The program makes more than 3n queries, which violates the problem constraints.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
