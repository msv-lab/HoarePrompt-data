Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) represents the count of numbers of types 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the final sequence respectively, where i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}.

Explanation: After executing the loop for each test case, the value of `cnt` is calculated based on the conditions given in the loop. The final value of `cnt` is printed, which represents the sum of the original numbers divided by 2 and a special condition check. The counts of numbers of types 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the final sequence are not directly affected by the loop and remain as the initial counts provided in the input.
