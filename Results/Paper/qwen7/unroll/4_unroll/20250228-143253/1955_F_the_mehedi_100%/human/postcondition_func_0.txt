The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by counts of four types (1, 2, 3, and 4) of numbers within the range of 0 to 200. For each test case, it calculates a value `cnt` based on specific conditions involving the input counts and prints this value. The function does not return any value but outputs the calculated `cnt` for each test case.
