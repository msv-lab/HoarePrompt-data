Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a non-zero value. This means the loop will continue until `input()` returns an empty string or some other value that evaluates to `False` when converted to an integer.

3. **Determine the Initial State**: We know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, this information is about the input that will be read inside the loop, not the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

4. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute**: For the loop to execute, the condition `int(input())` must return a non-zero value. Therefore, the initial state should ensure that the first input read is a positive integer.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the initial input that will be read by `int(input())`. Since `t` is a positive integer, the loop will execute as long as the input is a positive integer.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the first input read by int(input()) must be a positive integer within the specified range.**
