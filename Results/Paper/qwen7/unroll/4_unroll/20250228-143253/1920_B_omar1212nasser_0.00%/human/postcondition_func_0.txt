The function processes a specified number of test cases (`t`). For each test case, it reads three positive integers (`n`, `k`, `x`) and a list of `n` integers (`a`). It sorts the list `a` and then calls another function `func_2` with `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a` as arguments. After processing all test cases, it prints the result of `func_2` for each case.
