t is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); for each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), \(1 \leq x, k \leq n\); and a list of n integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\). The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
