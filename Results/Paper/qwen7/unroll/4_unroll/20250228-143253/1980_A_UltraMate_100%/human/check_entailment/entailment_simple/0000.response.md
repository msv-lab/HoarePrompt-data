Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variables Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes `n` and `m` (number of problems and number of rounds), and reads the string `s` which represents the difficulties of the problems in the bank.
3. **Counter Initialization**: It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
4. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed**:
   - For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', it checks if the required number of problems (`m`) is less than the available problems.
   - If fewer problems are available than required, it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to the answer `ans`.
5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

The logic ensures that for each difficulty level, the program calculates how many more problems are needed to meet the requirement for `m` rounds. This is done efficiently using the `Counter` to keep track of the counts and iterating over the fixed set of difficulty levels ('ABCDEFG').

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
