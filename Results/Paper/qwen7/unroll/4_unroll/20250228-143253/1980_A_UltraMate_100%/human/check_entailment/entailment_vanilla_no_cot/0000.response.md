Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that he can hold `m` rounds with at least one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - It reads the string `s` representing the difficulties of the existing problems.
   - It initializes a counter `hmp` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
   - It iterates over each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') and checks if it is missing in the counter `hmp`. If a difficulty level is missing, it means Vlad needs to create `m` problems of that difficulty level.
   - For each difficulty level present in `hmp`, if the count of that difficulty level is less than `m`, it calculates the additional problems needed for that difficulty level.
3. **Output**: It prints the total number of additional problems required for each test case.

The logic is sound and handles all edge cases as per the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
