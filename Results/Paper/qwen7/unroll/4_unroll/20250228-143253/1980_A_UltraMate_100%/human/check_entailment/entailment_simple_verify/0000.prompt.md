You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

    #State: t is the number of test cases, and for each test case, t is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, n and m are integers, s is a string consisting of uppercase letters from 'A' to 'G', and ans is the calculated value based on the conditions given in the loop. The final output is the value of ans for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure he can hold `m` rounds, each containing one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the number of rounds `m`, and the string `s` representing the difficulties of the existing problems.
3. It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
4. It iterates over each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') and checks if it is missing from the counter. If it is, it adds `m` to the answer because Vlad needs to create `m` problems of that difficulty level.
5. If the difficulty level is present but its count is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to the answer.

This approach ensures that Vlad creates the minimum number of new problems needed. The program handles all edge cases, such as when the bank already has sufficient problems for each difficulty level or when no problems are available for certain difficulty levels. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
