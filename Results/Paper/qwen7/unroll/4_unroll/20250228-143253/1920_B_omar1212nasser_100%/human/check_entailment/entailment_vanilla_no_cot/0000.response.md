Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This allows Alice to remove the smallest elements to maximize the remaining sum.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It calculates the potential sums after Alice removes up to `k` elements.
   - For each possible number of elements Alice removes (`i` from 0 to `k`), it calculates the new sum after removing these elements.
   - It also considers the effect of Bob multiplying up to `x` elements by -1. Specifically, it keeps track of the sum of the last `x` elements, which are candidates for being multiplied by -1.
   - It computes the maximum possible sum after both players make their moves.

3. **Main Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads the input and calls `func_2` with the appropriate parameters.
   - It prints the result returned by `func_2`.

The logic in `func_2` ensures that both players play optimally by considering all possible scenarios where Alice removes elements and Bob multiplies elements by -1. The solution handles all constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.
