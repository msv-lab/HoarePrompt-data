Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and `elements` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 1000 inclusive. After processing, the function returns the maximum value among the list `pos`, which contains values calculated by the formula `s - 2 * s2` for each iteration of the loop, where `s` is the sum of all elements in the `elements` list and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives + i` elements of `elements`.**
