Output State: **`pos` is an empty list, `removals` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `elements`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `elements` and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `pos`, `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements` remain unchanged from their initial state.
