Output State: **`pos` is an empty list, `removals` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and `elements` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 1000 inclusive.**

In this code snippet, a new empty list `pos` is created. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements` remain unchanged from their initial state.
