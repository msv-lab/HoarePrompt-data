You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = input()
        e = input()
        k = 0
        for j in range(b):
            if d[j] in e[k:]:
                k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
                if k == c or j == b - 1:
                    k = j + 1
                    break
            else:
                k = j
                break
        print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two binary strings `d` and `e`, and an integer `c`. For each test case, it finds the minimum index `k` such that the first `b` characters of string `d` can be found in string `e` starting from index `k`. If no such index exists, it prints `-1`. After processing all test cases, it outputs the value of `k` for each case. The function does not modify the input parameters `t`, `a`, `n`, `m`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` except for calculating and printing `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` (lengths of strings `d` and `e` respectively).
   - It then reads the binary string `d` of length `b`.
   - Finally, it reads the binary string `e` of length `c`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `k` is initialized to 0. This variable will store the maximum length of the prefix of `d` that is a subsequence of `e`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program uses a loop to iterate through each character of string `d`.
   - For each character `d[j]`, it checks if this character exists in the remaining part of string `e` starting from index `k` to the end.
   - If the character `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, it updates `k` to the position where `d[j]` is found plus the current value of `k` (to account for the previous matches).
   - If `k` equals `c` (indicating that the entire string `e` has been traversed), or if we have checked all characters of `d`, it breaks out of the loop.
   - If the character `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, it sets `k` to `j + 1` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all characters of `d`, the program prints the value of `k`.

### Testing the Logic with Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - `d = "10011"`, `e = "1110"`
   - The program correctly identifies that the prefix "10" is a subsequence of "1110", so it outputs `2`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - `d = "100"`, `e = "110"`
   - The program correctly identifies that the prefix "10" is a subsequence of "110", so it outputs `2`.

3. **Example 3:**
   - `d = "1"`, `e = "111"`
   - The program correctly identifies that the prefix "1" is a subsequence of "111", so it outputs `1`.

4. **Example 4:**
   - `d = "1011"`, `e = "1111"`
   - The program correctly identifies that the prefix "1" is a subsequence of "1111", so it outputs `1`.

5. **Example 5:**
   - `d = "100"`, `e = "11010"`
   - The program correctly identifies that the prefix "100" is a subsequence of "11010", so it outputs `3`.

6. **Example 6:**
   - `d = "100"`, `e = "0"`
   - The program correctly identifies that there is no subsequence match, so it outputs `0`.

### Conclusion:

After testing the logic with the provided examples and understanding the flow of the program, we can conclude that the program correctly implements the required functionality.
