t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; a is a binary string of length n; b is a binary string of length m; the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; the sum of all m values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
