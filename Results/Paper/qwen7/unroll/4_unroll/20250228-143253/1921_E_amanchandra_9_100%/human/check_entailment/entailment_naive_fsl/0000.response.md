Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. Let's consider a few examples:

1. **Case 1**: Board dimensions \(6 \times 5\), Alice starts at \((2, 2)\), Bob starts at \((5, 3)\).
   - According to the problem, Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left. Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left.
   - Alice can move to \((3, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), or \((3, 3)\).
   - Bob can move to \((4, 3)\), \((4, 2)\), or \((4, 4)\).
   - In this scenario, the program incorrectly determines the result as "Draw" because it does not properly simulate the optimal moves for both players.

2. **Case 2**: Board dimensions \(4 \times 1\), Alice starts at \((2, 1)\), Bob starts at \((4, 1)\).
   - Alice can only move down to \((3, 1)\).
   - Bob can only move up to \((3, 1)\).
   - Since both players can move to the same cell, the game should end in a win for Alice, but the program incorrectly outputs "Draw".

The provided solution does not correctly simulate the optimal moves for both players and fails to account for scenarios where one player can force a win. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
