The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes the number of card types (n), a redistribution limit (k), and a list of initial card counts (a). It redistributes the cards according to a specific algorithm to ensure the redistribution limit is met. After processing each test case, it outputs the total count of cards after redistribution. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
