You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program: 
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: Output State: The values of `t` and `x` remain unchanged, and the output consists of pairs of integers printed based on the condition in the loop. For each iteration `i` in the range of `x`, if the first integer `x` is greater than the second integer `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`; otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. The current implementation reads a single integer `x` at the beginning and then processes `x` test cases within the loop, which is incorrect. It should read the number of test cases `t` first and then process each test case individually. Here's an example that demonstrates the issue:

Input:
```
3
5 3
7 2
1 9
```

Expected Output:
```
3 5
2 7
1 9
```

Actual Output (with the given program):
```
3 5
2 7
9 1
```

The program does not correctly handle multiple test cases, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
