You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple pairs of integers from the user input, compares each pair, and prints them in descending order if the first integer is greater than the second; otherwise, it prints them in ascending order. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `x`, which represents the number of test cases.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: It then enters a loop that runs `x` times, processing each test case individually.
3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.
4. **Comparing and Printing**: 
   - It compares `x` and `y`.
   - If `x` is greater than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.

### Analysis:
- The logic in the program is flawed because it uses the same variable names `x` and `y` for both the number of test cases and the values within each test case. This leads to confusion and incorrect results.
- Specifically, the program should use different variables to store the values read from each test case to avoid overwriting the initial value of `x`.

### Corrected Version:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())  # Read two space-separated integers for each test case
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the reuse of variable names `x` and `y`. Therefore, the given program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Response:
Correctness: **False**
