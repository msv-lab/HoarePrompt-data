Reasoning:
1. The problem requires outputting the minimum and maximum of each pair of integers in the correct order.
2. The provided program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading pairs of integers.
3. For each pair, the program checks if the first integer (`x`) is greater than the second integer (`y`).
   - If `x > y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.
4. This logic correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values of each pair and prints them in the required order.
5. The execution summary indicates that the function behaves as expected, processing each test case and printing the results in the correct order.

Given this analysis, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
