State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0** 

### Explanation:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before entering the loop.
3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < x`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `x` must be greater than 0.
4. **Adjusting States**: We need to ensure that `x` is greater than 0 so that the loop can start executing. The value of `t` does not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` must be greater than 0, along with the initial values of `i` being 0 and `x` itself.
