The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it prints either 1, \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\), or \(\frac{k}{2} + 1\) based on the value of \( k \) relative to \( n \). Specifically, if \( k \) is 1, it prints 1. If \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 2n \), it prints \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\). Otherwise, it prints \(\frac{k}{2} + 1\). The function does not return any value but outputs these results for each test case.
