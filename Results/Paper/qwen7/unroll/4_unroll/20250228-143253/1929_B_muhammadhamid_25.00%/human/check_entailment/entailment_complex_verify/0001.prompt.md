You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of a series of lines, each containing either `1`, `math.ceil(k / 2)`, or `k // 2 + 1`, depending on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. For each test case, if `k` equals 1, the output is `1`. If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, the output is `math.ceil(k / 2)`. Otherwise, the output is `k // 2 + 1`. The number of lines in the output state corresponds to the number of test cases provided as input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it prints either 1, \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\), or \(\frac{k}{2} + 1\) based on the value of \( k \) relative to \( n \). Specifically, if \( k \) is 1, it prints 1. If \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 2n \), it prints \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\). Otherwise, it prints \(\frac{k}{2} + 1\). The function does not return any value but outputs these results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `k` for each case.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If `k == 1`, the program prints `1`. This is correct because, in the worst case, we need to color just one cell to satisfy the condition of having at least one colored diagonal.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - For `k > 1`, the program checks if `k <= 2 * n`.
     - If true, it prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
     - If false, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Special Case: \( k == 1 \)
- This case is handled correctly. For example, if \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 1 \), we need to color just one cell to ensure at least one diagonal is colored.

#### General Case: \( k > 1 \)
- **Condition Check**: `if k <= 2 * n`
  - This condition is necessary because for any \( n \times n \) grid, there are at most \( 2n \) diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left.
  - If \( k \leq 2n \), coloring \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) cells will ensure that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
  - This works because each cell can contribute to up to 2 diagonals (one from each direction).

- **Else Condition**: `else: print(k // 2 + 1)`
  - If \( k > 2n \), the logic ensures that we color enough cells to cover all required diagonals.
  - The formula \( k // 2 + 1 \) is derived from the observation that after coloring \( 2n \) cells, we still need additional cells to cover the remaining diagonals.
  - This formula ensures that we account for the extra diagonals beyond \( 2n \).

### Example Verification

Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 4 \)
  - \( \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
  - Correct answer: 2

- **Test Case 2**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
  - Correct answer: 2

- **Test Case 3**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 10 \)
  - \( 2n = 6 \), \( k > 2n \)
  - \( \frac{10}{2} + 1 = 6 \)
  - Correct answer: 6

- **Test Case 4**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 9 \)
  - \( 2n = 6 \), \( k > 2n \)
  - \( \frac{9}{2} + 1 = 5 \)
  - Correct answer: 5

- **Test Case 5**: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 7 \)
  - \( 2n = 8 \), \( k < 2n \)
  - \( \lceil \frac{7}{2} \rceil = 4 \)
  - Correct answer: 4

- **Test Case 6**: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 11 \)
  - \( 2n = 14 \), \( k < 2n \)
  - \( \lceil \frac{11}{2} \rceil = 6 \)
  - Correct answer: 6

- **Test Case 7**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - \( 2n = 4 \), \( k < 2n \)
  - \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
  - Correct answer: 2
