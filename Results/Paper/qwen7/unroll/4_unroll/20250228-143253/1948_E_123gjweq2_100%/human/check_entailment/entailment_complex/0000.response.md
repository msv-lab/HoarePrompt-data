### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to assign distinct integers to vertices of a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**:
     - The function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
     - It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`.
     - It calls `make_array` to fill these arrays.
     - It prints the contents of `arr`, the number of cliques, and the contents of `cliquess`.

   - **Function `make_array`**:
     - This function fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays based on the given `left`, `right`, and `clique` parameters.
     - It splits the range `[left, right]` into two halves and assigns values in a specific pattern.

3. **Verification**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - The `make_array` function ensures that the values in `arr` and `cliquess` are assigned in a way that satisfies the conditions of the problem.
   - The output format matches the required format: the first line contains the assigned values, the second line contains the number of cliques, and the third line contains the partition of the graph into cliques.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the constraints `2 ≤ n ≤ 40` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 2n` appropriately.
   - The use of `ceil(n / k)` ensures that the number of cliques is minimized.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_1` and `make_array` is consistent with the problem requirements.
   - The output format is correct and meets the problem's specifications.

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
