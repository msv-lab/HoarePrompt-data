Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Function Name**: The function `make_array` is defined but never called within the main function `func_1`. This means that the array `arr` and the list `cliquess` will remain uninitialized, leading to undefined behavior when printing the results.

2. **Array Initialization**: The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized to all zeros, but they are never updated within the `func_1` function. Instead, the `make_array` function is supposed to update these arrays, but it does not get called.

3. **Logic Error in `make_array`**: The logic inside `make_array` is flawed. It attempts to fill the array `arr` and the list `cliquess` with values, but the indices used are incorrect. Specifically, the array `arr` is not properly filled with distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Partitioning Logic**: The logic to ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques is missing. The current implementation does not guarantee that the graph will be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(n, k):
    # Calculate the number of cliques needed
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    
    # Initialize the arrays
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    
    # Assign values to vertices
    for i in range(n):
        arr[i] = i + 1
        cliquess[i] = (i // k) + 1
    
    # Print the result
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        func_1(n, k)
```

This corrected version initializes the arrays correctly and ensures that each vertex gets a unique value from 1 to `n`. It also calculates the number of cliques and assigns each vertex to a clique based on the division by `k`, ensuring that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
