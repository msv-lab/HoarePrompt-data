Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6 and the product of n and m does not exceed 2⋅10^6, and they are the values returned by `func_7()`**.

This means that after executing `n, m = func_7()`, the values of `n` and `m` are the ones returned by the function `func_7()`. The conditions that `n` and `m` must satisfy (both being positive integers within the specified range and their product not exceeding \(2 \cdot 10^6\)) remain valid.
