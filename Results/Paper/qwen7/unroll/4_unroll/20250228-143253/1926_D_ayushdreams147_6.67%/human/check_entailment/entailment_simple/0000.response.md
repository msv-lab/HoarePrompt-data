### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to divide the integers into groups such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit at any position from 1 to 31. The solution uses a bitwise trick to achieve this.

Here's the breakdown of the solution:

1. **Bitwise Operation**: The expression `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` flips all the bits of the number `num`. This ensures that if two numbers `x` and `y` have different bits in any position from 1 to 31, their counterparts after the bitwise operation will also differ in some bit position.

2. **Counting Unique Elements**: The code counts how many unique elements there are after applying the bitwise operation. Since the bitwise operation ensures that no two numbers with matching bits in positions 1 to 31 will have the same result, the number of unique results corresponds to the minimum number of groups needed.

3. **Group Assignment**: For each number, if it hasn't been seen before, it is assigned to a new group (incrementing the result counter). If it has been seen before, it is decremented from the count of the corresponding group.

The logic in the function `func_1` correctly implements the above steps. It ensures that each number is placed in a unique group based on its bitwise transformation, which guarantees that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit in any position from 1 to 31.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the provided solution should work correctly for the given test cases.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**

The program correctly determines the minimum number of groups required to satisfy the condition specified in the problem statement.
