### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate participants based on their preferences.
   - Introverts must have a tent alone.
   - Extroverts prefer to share a tent with two others.
   - Universals can share a tent with anyone.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it checks if there are enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts.
   - If not, it returns `None` indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone.
   - Otherwise, it returns the number of tents needed using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the total number of tents required.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate everyone, so it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of tents needed for introverts (`introverts`) to the result from `func_1`.

4. **Checking the Implementation:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the pairing of extroverts and universals.
   - However, there is a potential issue in `func_1` when calculating the number of tents needed. Specifically, the condition `if extroverts % 3 != 0` should be checked before calling `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`. The current implementation might lead to incorrect results in some cases.
   - For example, consider the case where `extroverts = 2` and `universals = 1`. According to the logic, since `2 % 3 == 2` and `2 + 1 >= 3`, it should return `1` tent. But the current implementation would incorrectly return `None` because `2 % 3 != 0`.

5. **Testing the Functions:**
   - The example test cases provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the functions.
   - However, the test cases do not cover all edge cases, particularly those where the condition in `func_1` might fail to correctly handle the pairing of extroverts and universals.

### Conclusion:
The given program has a logical flaw in `func_1` that could lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios. The original assessment did not fully address this potential issue, and the test cases provided may not have uncovered this flaw.

**Correctness: **False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
