Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all scenarios, particularly when calculating the number of tents required for the given constraints. Let's analyze why:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. However, it doesn't fully account for the constraints. Specifically, it doesn't ensure that every extrovert can find a place to stay with at least two others or that universals can fill the remaining spots.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses `func_1` to calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals and then adds the number of tents needed for introverts. However, it does not correctly handle cases where the number of extroverts and universals cannot form complete groups of three.

Let's provide a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

def min_tents(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
    # Tents for introverts
    tents_for_introverts = a
    
    # Tents for extroverts and universals
    # Each extrovert needs a tent with 2 others, and universals can fill the remaining spots
    # We need to ensure we can form complete groups of 3
    remaining_people = b + c
    full_groups = remaining_people // 3
    remaining_people_after_full_groups = remaining_people % 3
    
    # Tents needed for full groups of 3
    tents_for_full_groups = full_groups
    
    # Additional tents needed for remaining people
    additional_tents = 0
    if remaining_people_after_full_groups == 1:
        # If there's 1 person left, it's impossible to form a group of 3
        return -1
    elif remaining_people_after_full_groups == 2:
        # If there are 2 people left, they can share a tent with an introvert
        additional_tents = 1
    
    # Total tents
    total_tents = tents_for_introverts + tents_for_full_groups + additional_tents
    
    return total_tents

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().strip().split())
        print(min_tents(a, b, c))
```

This corrected version ensures that the constraints are properly handled and calculates the minimum number of tents correctly.
