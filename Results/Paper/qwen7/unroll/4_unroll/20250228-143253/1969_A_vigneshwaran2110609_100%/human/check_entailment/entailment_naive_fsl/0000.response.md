Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. Specifically, the program checks if any friend is the best friend of another invited friend and prints 2 if this condition is met. However, this logic is insufficient because it does not account for scenarios where no such direct pair exists but inviting more friends can still satisfy the condition.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
3 1 2 5 4
```
The program outputs 2, which is incorrect. In this case, inviting friends 4 and 5 ensures both come to the party, but the program incorrectly prints 2 without checking if inviting just these two is the minimum number of invitations needed.

A correct approach would involve checking all possible pairs of friends and determining the minimum set of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
