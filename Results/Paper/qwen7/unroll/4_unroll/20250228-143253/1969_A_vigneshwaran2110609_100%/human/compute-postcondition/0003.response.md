Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct. The loop prints either 2 or 3 for each iteration based on the condition inside the loop. Since the loop does not modify any of the variables outside its scope (t, n, and p), their states remain unchanged. The output consists of a series of 2's or 3's printed during the loop executions, depending on whether the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` was met for each iteration.
