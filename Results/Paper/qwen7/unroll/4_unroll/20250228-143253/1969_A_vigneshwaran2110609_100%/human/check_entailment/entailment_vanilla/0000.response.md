### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations required so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend will come to the party if both the friend and their best friend (given by `p_i`) receive an invitation.
   - The program should output the minimum number of invitations needed for each test case.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The function `func()` does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem.
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`n`), but it does not handle each test case properly.
   - The code attempts to check if a pair of friends `(i, l[i]-1)` are each other’s best friends and prints `2` if true.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`. However, this logic is flawed because it does not ensure that at least 2 friends will come to the party.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - For each test case, we need to identify pairs of friends who are each other’s best friends.
   - If there is at least one such pair, we only need to invite those two friends, which requires 2 invitations.
   - If no such pair exists, we need to invite at least 3 friends to ensure at least 2 come to the party.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - We need to iterate through the list of friends and check for pairs where `l[l[i]-1] == i+1`.
   - If such a pair is found, we print `2`.
   - Otherwise, we print `3`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        invited = set()
        for i in range(n):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                invited.add(i + 1)
                invited.add(l[i])
        if len(invited) >= 2:
            print(len(invited))
        else:
            print(3)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations needed. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
