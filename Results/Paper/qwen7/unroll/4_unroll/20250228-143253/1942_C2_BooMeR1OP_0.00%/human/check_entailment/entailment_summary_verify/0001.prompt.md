You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \), an integer \( x \), an integer \( y \), and a list of \( x \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \). It calculates and returns an integer value \( ans \) based on specific conditions related to the gaps between the numbers in the list. Specifically, it counts the number of valid gaps (where the next two consecutive numbers modulo \( n \) meet certain criteria) and adjusts \( ans \) accordingly, while also decrementing \( y \) appropriately. The final value of \( ans \) represents the sum of these adjustments.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the list of `x` chosen vertices.
   - It adjusts the vertex indices to be zero-based (`a = [num - 1 for num in a]`).
   - It sorts the list of chosen vertices (`a.sort()`).

2. **Initial Triangles Calculation:**
   - The initial number of triangles is calculated as `x - 2` because any set of 3 vertices forms a triangle, and we start with `x` vertices.
   - It checks if adding adjacent vertices (`t1` and `t2`) to the existing chosen vertices can form additional triangles. If `t1` is not chosen and `t2` is chosen, it adds one more triangle (`ans += 1`).

3. **Gap Calculation:**
   - It calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.
   - These gaps are sorted to prioritize filling the largest gaps first.
   - For each gap, it checks how many pairs of vertices can be added without exceeding the limit `y`.

4. **Adding More Triangles:**
   - For each gap, it calculates how many pairs of vertices can be added (`pairs = gap // 2`).
   - If `y` is sufficient to add these pairs, it adds the full number of triangles corresponding to these pairs (`ans += gap`), and reduces `y` accordingly.
   - If `y` is insufficient, it adds the maximum possible triangles (`2 * y`), and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the total number of triangles.

### Verification

1. **Initial Triangle Calculation:**
   - The calculation `x - 2` is correct for the initial number of triangles formed by the chosen vertices.

2. **Adjacent Vertex Check:**
   - The check for adding adjacent vertices (`t1` and `t2`) is correct and ensures that no new triangles overlap.

3. **Gap Calculation and Filling:**
   - Sorting the gaps and filling them from largest to smallest is a good strategy to maximize the number of triangles.
   - The logic for adding pairs of vertices and updating `y` is correct.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `y` might be insufficient to fill all gaps completely.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. It follows the steps outlined in the problem description and handles the constraints appropriately.
