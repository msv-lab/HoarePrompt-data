Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order where each element is (original element - 1), `present` is a set containing all elements of the list `a` minus one, `ans` is x - 2 + sum of `gap` for all iterations where `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `present` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `present`, `gaps` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` plus `n` for the last element, adjusted by subtracting the original elements, and `gaps` is sorted.
