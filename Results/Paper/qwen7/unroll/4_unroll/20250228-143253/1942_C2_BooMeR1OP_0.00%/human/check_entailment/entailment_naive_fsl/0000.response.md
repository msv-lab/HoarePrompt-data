Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake is flawed. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  4 2 2
  1 3
  ```

Expected output: `2` (since we can choose 2 additional vertices to maximize the number of triangles).

However, the program's current logic might not correctly account for all possible ways to maximize the number of triangles. For instance, the program checks for immediate neighbors and then tries to fill gaps, but it does not fully explore all possible configurations.

To illustrate the issue, let's manually analyze the given test case:
- We have a polygon with 4 sides, and Bessie has chosen vertices 1 and 3.
- We can choose up to 2 additional vertices.

A correct approach would involve checking all possible combinations of choosing 2 additional vertices to ensure the maximum number of triangles is formed. However, the current implementation does not guarantee this.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, leading to a verdict of **False**.
