Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order where each element is (original element - 1), `present` is a set containing all elements of the list `a` minus one, `ans` is x - 2.**

The code assigns the value of `x - 2` to the variable `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `present` remain unchanged from their initial states.
