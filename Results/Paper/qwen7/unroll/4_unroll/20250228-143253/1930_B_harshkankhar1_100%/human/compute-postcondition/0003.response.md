Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each test case, it performs some unspecified operations and returns results based on the given constraints.**
