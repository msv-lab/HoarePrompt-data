### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Permutation Generation**:
   - Inside the loop for each test case, the function `func_1()` is called.
   - `func_1()` generates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then reverses every other element in the list starting from the first element (i.e., elements at even indices).
   - Finally, it prints the list `a`.

3. **Permutation Validity**:
   - Let's analyze the generated permutations:
     - For `n=4`, the permutation is `[4, 1, 2, 3]`.
       - Checking pairs: 
         - `(4, 1)` and `(1, 2)` do not satisfy the divisibility condition.
         - `(2, 3)` does not satisfy the divisibility condition.
     - For `n=3`, the permutation is `[3, 2, 1]`.
       - Checking pairs:
         - `(3, 2)` and `(2, 1)` do not satisfy the divisibility condition.
   - These examples show that the generated permutations meet the required conditions.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, as it only processes up to `10^5` elements in total across all test cases.
   - The permutation generation logic ensures that the resulting permutation meets the required conditions for all valid `n`.

However, there is a critical flaw in the program's logic:
- The program generates permutations by simply reversing every other element. This approach does not guarantee that no two consecutive elements `(p_i, p_{i+1})` and `(p_j, p_{j+1})` will satisfy the divisibility condition for all possible `n`.

To illustrate, consider `n=6`:
- The generated permutation would be `[6, 2, 5, 1, 4, 3]`.
- Checking pairs:
  - `(6, 2)` and `(2, 5)` do not satisfy the divisibility condition.
  - `(5, 1)` and `(1, 4)` do not satisfy the divisibility condition.
  - `(4, 3)` does not satisfy the divisibility condition.
- However, consider the pair `(6, 2)` and `(5, 1)`. While `(6, 2)` and `(5, 1)` do not satisfy the condition, the pair `(2, 5)` and `(1, 4)` might still violate the condition if further checks are not performed.

Thus, the program does not guarantee that the generated permutations will always meet the required conditions for all `n`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is not guaranteed to generate a valid permutation for all test cases due to the lack of thorough validation of the generated permutations against the divisibility condition.
