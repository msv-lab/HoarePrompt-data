Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Permutation Generation**:
   - Inside the loop for each test case, the function `func_1()` is called.
   - `func_1()` generates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then reverses every other element in the list starting from the first element (i.e., elements at even indices).
   - Finally, it prints the list `a`.

3. **Permutation Validity**:
   - We need to check if the generated permutation satisfies the condition: there do not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - Consider the generated permutation `[4, 1, 2, 3]` for `n=4`. Here, no pair of consecutive elements `(p_i, p_{i+1})` and `(p_j, p_{j+1})` exists where both pairs satisfy the divisibility condition.
   - Similarly, for `n=3`, the permutation `[1, 2, 3]` is valid because no such pair exists.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, as it only processes up to `10^5` elements in total across all test cases.
   - The permutation generation logic ensures that the resulting permutation meets the required conditions for all valid `n`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly generates a valid permutation for each test case as per the problem statement.

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **True**
