Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If true, it directly calculates the profit as `n * a` because selling all buns at the usual price would yield the maximum profit.
4. If `a` is less than `b`, it calculates the optimal value of `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This ensures that `k` is within the valid range and maximizes the profit.
5. It then calculates `ans` using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.
6. It also calculates `p2` as `(n - k) * a`.
7. Finally, it prints the total profit as `ans + p2`.

Given the logic and the formulas used, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem statement. There are no logical errors or omissions in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
