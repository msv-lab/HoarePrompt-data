State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(t)` to determine how many times it should iterate.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) because `range(0)` would result in no iterations.
3. No other variables or states need to be adjusted since the loop head only involves the variable `t`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts must be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.
