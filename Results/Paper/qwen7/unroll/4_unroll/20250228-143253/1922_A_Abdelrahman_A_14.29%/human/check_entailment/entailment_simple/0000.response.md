Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `slength`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It initializes a boolean variable `no` to `True`, which is used to determine if the conditions for printing 'NO' are met.
4. The program checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`. If it is, it directly prints 'NO' and sets `no` to `False`.
5. If `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`, it iterates through each character in `c` and checks if it is present in both `a` and `b`. If any character in `c` is not found in either `a` or `b`, it prints 'YES' and sets `no` to `False`, breaking out of the loop.
6. If no character in `c` meets the criteria to print 'YES', it prints 'NO'.
7. The logic in the annotated program aligns with the problem statement and examples provided.

Given this analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
