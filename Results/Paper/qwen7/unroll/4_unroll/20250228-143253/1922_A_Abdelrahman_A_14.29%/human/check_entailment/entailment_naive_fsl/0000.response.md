Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, and if not, it prints "YES". However, this approach is incorrect because it does not ensure that both `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not. Instead, it only checks if `c` is exactly the same as `a` or `b`.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
1
3
mathforces
luckforces
adhoccoder
```

- Expected Output:
```
NO
```

- Program Output:
```
YES
```

This is incorrect because both `a` and `b` do not match the template "mathforces", but `c` also does not match the template. The program incorrectly prints "YES" because it only checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`.

The correct approach would involve checking if both `a` and `b` match the template while ensuring that `c` does not. This requires a more complex logic to construct the template and verify the conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c`.
