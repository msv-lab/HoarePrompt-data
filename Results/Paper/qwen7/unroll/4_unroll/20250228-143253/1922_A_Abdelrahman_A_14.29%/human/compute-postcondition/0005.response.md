Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (length of strings), and three strings a, b, and c (each of length n). For each test case, it checks if string c contains any character not present in either string a or b. If c contains any such character, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
