Output State: The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each test case (`i` in `range(tests)`), if `c` contains any character that is present in both `a` and `b`, or if `c` contains any character not present in either `a` or `b`, then 'NO' will be printed. Otherwise, 'YES' will be printed. The number of 'YES' and 'NO' outputs will depend on the specific inputs provided for each test case.
