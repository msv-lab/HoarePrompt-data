Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses based on the conditions checked within the loop for each iteration. For each test case (`i` in `range(tests)`), the program checks if the string `c` contains any character that is not present in either string `a` or `b`. If `c` contains a character from `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, if `c` contains only characters present in both `a` and `b`, it prints 'YES'. This process is repeated for each test case provided by the input integer `tests`.
