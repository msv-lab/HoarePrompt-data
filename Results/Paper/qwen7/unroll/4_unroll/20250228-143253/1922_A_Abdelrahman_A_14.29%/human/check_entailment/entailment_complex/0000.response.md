Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`tests`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **String Length Handling**: For each test case, it correctly reads the length of the strings (`slength`).
3. **String Input Handling**: It reads the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` as specified.
4. **Template Validation Logic**:
   - The program initializes a boolean variable `no` to `True`, indicating that initially, no template has been found.
   - It checks if `c` is identical to `a` or `b`. If so, it immediately prints 'NO' because `c` would match the template of `a` or `b`, which contradicts the requirement.
   - If `c` is not identical to `a` or `b`, it iterates through each character in `c` and checks if it is present in both `a` and `b`. If it finds a character in `c` that is not present in either `a` or `b`, it prints 'YES' and sets `no` to `False`, breaking out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a character, it prints 'NO'.
5. **Output Handling**: The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the validation logic, as required by the problem statement.

Given that the program correctly follows the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately, the annotated program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
