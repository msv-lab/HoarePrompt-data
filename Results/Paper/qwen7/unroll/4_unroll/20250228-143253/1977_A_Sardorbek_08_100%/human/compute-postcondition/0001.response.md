State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` must be 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `a`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `a` must be at least 1 (since `range(a)` will generate numbers from 0 to `a-1`).
3. Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0 because the loop will start with `i = 0` and increment `i` in each iteration.
4. The value of `t` is not directly related to the loop's execution but is given as additional information about the state.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `a` to ensure it is at least 1, and `i` to be initialized to 0.
