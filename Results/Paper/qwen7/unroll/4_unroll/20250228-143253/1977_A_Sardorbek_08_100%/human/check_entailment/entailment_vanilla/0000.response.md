Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop where it processes each test case individually.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It checks the conditions to determine if it's possible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves.

3. **Conditions Checked:**
   - **Condition 1:** `b == c`
     - If the number of moves (`b`) equals the desired number of cubes (`c`), it prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move.
   - **Condition 2:** `b < c`
     - If the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because it's impossible to end up with more cubes than moves.
   - **Condition 3:** `b % 2 == c % 2`
     - If the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of moves matches the parity of the desired number of cubes, it prints 'Yes'. This is correct because adding or removing cubes alternately will maintain the parity.
   - **Else Condition:**
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'No'. This covers all other cases, but we need to ensure this condition correctly handles all scenarios not covered by the previous ones.

### Detailed Check:

- **Condition 1:** `b == c` is correct.
- **Condition 2:** `b < c` is correct.
- **Condition 3:** `b % 2 == c % 2` is correct because maintaining the parity ensures that the operations (adding or removing one cube at a time) can achieve the desired result.
- **Else Condition:** This should handle cases where `b` is even and `c` is odd, or vice versa. However, the current implementation incorrectly prints 'Yes' instead of 'No' when the parities do not match.

### Correct Implementation:

To fix the issue, the `else` block should print 'No' when the parities do not match:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')  # Corrected to print 'NO' when parities do not match
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has a logical error in the `else` block. After correcting it, the program will be fully correct according to the problem statement.

**Correctness: False** (Original program)  
**Correctness: True** (After correction)
