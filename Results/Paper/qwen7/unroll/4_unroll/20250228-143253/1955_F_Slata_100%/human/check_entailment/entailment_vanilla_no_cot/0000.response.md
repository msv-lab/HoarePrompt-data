Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program calculates the sum of half the counts of `1`s, `2`s, `3`s, and `4`s plus a boolean check for the parity condition, but it does not accurately simulate the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the bitwise XOR operation and how removing numbers affects the overall XOR result. Here’s a more accurate approach:

1. **Initial XOR Calculation**: Calculate the initial XOR of all numbers.
2. **Optimal Removal Strategy**: Determine the optimal number to remove to ensure Bob wins as many times as possible. This involves checking which number removals would keep the XOR non-zero for as long as possible.

Here’s a revised version of the function to correctly solve the problem:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        # Initial XOR value
        xor_value = a ^ b ^ c ^ d
        
        # Count of numbers that contribute to making the XOR zero
        count_zero_contributors = 0
        
        # Check which numbers contribute to making the XOR zero
        if xor_value & 1 == 0:  # If the least significant bit is 0
            count_zero_contributors += a
        if xor_value & 2 == 0:
            count_zero_contributors += b
        if xor_value & 4 == 0:
            count_zero_contributors += c
        if xor_value & 8 == 0:
            count_zero_contributors += d
        
        # The maximum number of times Bob can win is equal to the count of numbers that contribute to making the XOR zero
        print(count_zero_contributors)

func()
```

This revised function correctly calculates the initial XOR and then determines how many numbers contribute to making the XOR zero, which is the key to determining the maximum number of times Bob can win.
