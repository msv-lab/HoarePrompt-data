Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder for the loop index) and `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Variables**:
   - The variable `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not hold a specific value but rather acts as an index for each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer and is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), it will always be greater than 0 initially.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. This means `t` should be greater than 0.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
