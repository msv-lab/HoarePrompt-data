You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, indicating the initial position of your cow.
def func_1(a):
    x = a[k]
    ind = []
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:
            ind.append(i)

    #State: Output State: `ind` is a list containing indices of the first two cows with ratings greater than the rating of the initial cow at position `k`, `c` is 2, `x` is the integer at index `k` in list `a`, and `a` remains a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows.

        #State: Postcondition: `ind` is a list containing indices of the first two cows with ratings greater than the rating of the initial cow at position `k`, `c` is 2, `x` is the integer at index `k` in list `a`, and `a` remains a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The length of `ind` is exactly 1, and the first element of `ind` is not the index of the cow with the smallest rating among those greater than `x`.
        if (ind[0] > k) :

Additionally, the length of `ind` is greater than 1, and `ind` is not an empty list.
    if (ind[0] == 0) :

Additionally, the length of `ind` is greater than 1, and `ind` is not an empty list. The first element of `ind` is not 0.
    if (k > ind[1]) :
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])

    #State: Postcondition: `ind` is a list containing indices of the first two cows with ratings greater than the rating of the initial cow at position `k`, `c` is 2, `x` is the integer at index `k` in list `a`, and `a` remains a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. Additionally, the length of `ind` is greater than 1, and `ind` is not an empty list. The first element of `ind` is not 0, and `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`.
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])
    #The program returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (k - ind[0])
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. It returns one of the following values based on specific conditions: n-1 (where n is the number of distinct integers in the list `a`), k-1 (where k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, indicating the initial position of your cow), the first element in the list `ind` minus 1, the maximum value between k minus the index of the first cow with a rating greater than x or the index of the first cow with a rating greater than x minus 1, the minimum value between the second index in list `ind` decremented by 1 and the index `k` decremented by 1, the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (ind[1] - ind[0]), or the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (k - ind[0]).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the value of n minus 1, where n is the number of distinct integers in the list 'a'.

Case_2: The program returns k minus 1

Case_3: The program returns a value which is the first element in the list `ind` minus 1.

Case_4: The program returns the maximum value between k minus the index of the first cow with a rating greater than x, or the index of the first cow with a rating greater than x minus 1.

Case_5: The program returns the minimum value between the second index in list `ind` decremented by 1 and the index `k` decremented by 1.

Case_6: The program returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (ind[1] - ind[0])

Case_7: The program returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (k - ind[0])
