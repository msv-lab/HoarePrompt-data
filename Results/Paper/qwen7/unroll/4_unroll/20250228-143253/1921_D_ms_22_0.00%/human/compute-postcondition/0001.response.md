Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, this condition is preserved, and `t` now holds the value of the input integer within the specified range. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`) remain in their initial undefined state as they were not affected by the given code.
