Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and the new state of `a` is the integer input provided by the user, which is constrained to be between 2 and 10 (inclusive) as per the problem description.
