Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `a`.
2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**: 
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `a`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `a` must be at least 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `a` is an input integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 10\).

For the loop to execute at least once, `a` must be at least 1. Since the problem specifies that \(2 \leq n \leq 10\), we know that `a` is already within the valid range for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that `a` is at least 1 (which it already is according to the given constraints).

However, since `t` is not directly involved in the loop condition and its value does not affect the loop execution, it does not need to be adjusted.

So, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`a` must be at least 1**.
