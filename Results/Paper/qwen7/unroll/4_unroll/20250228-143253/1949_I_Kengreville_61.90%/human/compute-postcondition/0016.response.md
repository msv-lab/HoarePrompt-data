Based on the initial state provided:

- `nodes` is an empty list.
- `coef0` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `n` is the same input integer.
- `x` is a list of `n` integers.
- `y` is a list of `n` integers.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers.
- `visited` is a list of `n` True values.
- `coef1` is a list of `n` ones.
- `ok` is True.
- The sum of `coef1` for all nodes in `nodes` is not 0.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
