Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `i`, which represents the index of the disk to start the DFS traversal from. It does not return any value but updates the `visited` list and `nodes` list during the traversal.**

This means the function `dfs` accepts an integer `i` that indicates the starting index of a disk in the traversal. The function performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal of the disks, marking each disk as visited and recording the order of visited disks in the `nodes` list. It does not return any value after completing the traversal.
