Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the sum of all radii strictly decreases. Instead, it checks if there exists at least one pair of tangent disks and adjusts their coefficients, which is not sufficient to guarantee that the sum of all radii will strictly decrease.

To illustrate this, consider the following input:

```
4
2 2 2
7 2 3
7 7 2
2 7 3
```

This is the same input as in the second example, which the problem statement indicates should output "NO". However, the provided program does not handle this case correctly and would likely output "YES" because it only checks for the existence of tangent pairs and does not ensure that the sum of all radii strictly decreases.

A correct implementation would need to ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases for all disks, not just for pairs of tangent disks. The current implementation does not achieve this, making the program incorrect.
