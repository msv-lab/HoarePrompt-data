n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, x and y are lists of n integers each, representing the x and y coordinates of the centers of the disks respectively, and r is a list of n integers, representing the radii of the disks respectively. The values of x, y, and r are such that -10^9 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.
