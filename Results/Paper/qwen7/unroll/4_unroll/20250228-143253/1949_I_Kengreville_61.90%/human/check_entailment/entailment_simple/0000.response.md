### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk. It also initializes necessary lists and variables.

2. **DFS Traversal and Coefficient Calculation**:
   - The program performs a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the graph formed by the tangency relationships between the disks.
   - For each disk `i`, if it hasn't been visited, it initializes `coef0[i]` to 0 and `coef1[i]` to 1, and starts a DFS from this disk.
   - During the DFS, for each neighboring disk `j` (i.e., a disk that is tangent to disk `i`), it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` based on the tangency condition `(r[i] + r[j])^2 == dx^2 + dy^2`.

3. **Checking the Condition**:
   - After completing the DFS for each disk, the program checks if the sum of `coef1` for all nodes in the current connected component is non-zero.
   - If the sum of `coef1` is non-zero for any connected component, it means it's possible to adjust the radii such that the sum of all radii decreases while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap.

4. **Output**:
   - If any connected component satisfies the condition, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where no two disks overlap in a region of positive area and ensures that the tangency relationships are maintained.

Given the above analysis, the program logic appears to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately. It correctly identifies whether it is possible to adjust the radii as required.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii of the disks under the given constraints.
