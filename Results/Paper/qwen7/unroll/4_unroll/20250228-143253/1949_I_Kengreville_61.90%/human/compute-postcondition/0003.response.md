Output State: **`visited[i]` is `True`, `n` is an integer representing the number of disks, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` containing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively, `nodes` is a list used to store the order of visited nodes during the DFS traversal with `i` appended, and `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of length `n` initialized to `0`.**

The code `nodes.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `nodes`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
