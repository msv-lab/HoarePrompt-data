### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Input Parsing
- The program correctly reads the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk.

#### Initialization
- Arrays `x`, `y`, and `r` store the coordinates and radii of the disks.
- Arrays `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are initialized to keep track of visited nodes and coefficients.
- `nodes` is used to store nodes during DFS traversal.

#### Main Logic
1. **DFS Traversal:**
   - The program iterates through each disk to perform a DFS starting from unvisited disks.
   - During DFS, it checks if two disks are tangent (`(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`).
   - If two disks are tangent, it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` to ensure that the tangency condition remains true even after decreasing the radii.
   - It then recursively calls DFS on the neighboring disk.

2. **Coefficient Update:**
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are updated correctly to maintain the tangency condition.
   - Specifically, for a tangent pair `(i, j)`, the update rule is:
     \[
     \text{coef0}[j] = r[i] + r[j] - \text{coef0}[i]
     \]
     \[
     \text{coef1}[j] = -\text{coef1}[i]
     \]

3. **Sum of Radii:**
   - After completing the DFS, it checks if the sum of `coef1` values for the current node and its neighbors is non-zero. If so, it means we can reduce the radii while maintaining tangency and reducing the total radius.

#### Edge Cases
- The program handles the case where disks are tangent and the tangency condition must be preserved.
- It correctly identifies when it is possible to reduce the radii without violating the tangency conditions.

#### Correctness Check
- The program correctly identifies tangent disks using the distance formula between their centers and their radii.
- The DFS ensures that all connected components (sets of tangent disks) are processed.
- The coefficient update ensures that the tangency condition is maintained.
- The check for the non-zero `coef1` sum ensures that the total radius can be reduced.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is read and initialized.
   - Arrays `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` are initialized.

2. **DFS Call:**
   - For each unvisited disk `i`, a DFS is initiated.
   - During DFS, for each tangent pair `(i, j)`, the coefficients are updated.
   - The `visited` array is updated to mark the disks as visited.
   - The `nodes` list stores the order of visited disks.

3. **Coefficient Sum Calculation:**
   - After the DFS, the sum of `coef1` values for the current node and its neighbors is calculated.
   - If the sum is non-zero, `ok` is set to `True`.

4. **Output:**
   - If `ok` is `True`, "YES" is printed.
   - Otherwise, "NO" is printed.

### Conclusion
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks while maintaining tangency and reducing the total radius. The annotated code confirms that the program follows the correct steps and handles edge cases appropriately.
