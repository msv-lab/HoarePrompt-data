Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move involves adding or removing one cube.
- The provided program attempts to solve this by checking several conditions:
  - If `b` (number of moves) equals `c` (desired number of cubes), it prints 'YES'.
  - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'.
  - It checks if `a` (which seems to be a typo and should be `b`) and `b` have the same parity and prints 'Yes' if they do, otherwise 'No'.
- However, the logic for determining if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves is flawed:
  - The condition `if b == c:` correctly identifies a scenario where it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
  - The condition `elif b < c:` incorrectly identifies scenarios where it's impossible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, which is not always true.
  - The parity check (`elif a % 2 == b % 2:`) is irrelevant to the problem since `a` is not used in the problem statement.
- A correct approach would be to check if `n` (the number of moves) is at least `m` (the desired number of cubes) and if the difference between `n` and `m` is even (since each pair of add and remove operations cancels out).

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
