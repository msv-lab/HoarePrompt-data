Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Parity**: The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` to check if the final number of cubes (`c`) has the same parity as the total number of moves (`b`).

2. **Unnecessary Variables and Logic**: The variables `b`, `c`, and `q` are unnecessary and can be directly used in the logic. The variable `a` in the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` should be `b`.

3. **Case Handling**: The program needs to handle all cases properly:
   - If `b == c`, then it's always possible.
   - If `b < c`, it's impossible because you can only add cubes, not remove more than you have.
   - If `b > c` and `b % 2 == c % 2`, it's possible to achieve `c` cubes by adding and removing cubes appropriately.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b > c and b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This corrected version checks the conditions correctly and handles all edge cases as required.
