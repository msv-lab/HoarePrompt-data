Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program checks if `b` (the number of moves) is equal to `c` (the desired number of cubes), or if `a` (which is unused in the function) and `b` have the same parity (both even or both odd). However, the program fails to consider the actual operations of adding or removing cubes, which can result in different outcomes depending on the sequence of moves.

For example, in the third test case `(5, 3)`, the program incorrectly prints 'Yes' because `5 % 2 == 3 % 2`. However, it is not possible to end up with exactly 3 cubes after 5 moves if each move is either adding or removing one cube. The correct approach would involve checking if the difference between the number of addition and removal moves can result in the desired number of cubes.

A corrected version of the function could be:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print('No')
        elif abs(b - c) <= b:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

This corrected version checks if the total number of moves (`b + c`) is even, and if the absolute difference between the number of additions and removals (`abs(b - c)`) is less than or equal to the number of moves (`b`).
