The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( b \) and \( c \) (where \( 1 \leq b, c \leq 100 \)). For each test case, it prints 'YES' if \( b \) equals \( c \), 'NO' if \( b \) is less than \( c \), 'Yes' if both \( a \) and \( b \) have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
