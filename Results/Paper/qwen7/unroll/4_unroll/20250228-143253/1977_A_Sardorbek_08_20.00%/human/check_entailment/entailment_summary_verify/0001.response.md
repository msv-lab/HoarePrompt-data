### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and function summary.

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`, which represent the number of moves and the desired number of cubes respectively.
3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1**: `if b == c`
     - This condition checks if the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes. If this is true, it means that each move adds exactly one cube, and thus, it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes. This condition is correct.
   - **Condition 2**: `elif b < c`
     - This condition checks if the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes. If this is true, it is impossible to achieve the desired number of cubes because there aren't enough moves to add the required number of cubes. This condition is correct.
   - **Condition 3**: `elif a % 2 == b % 2`
     - This condition checks if the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves matches the parity of the number of test cases. However, this condition is irrelevant to the problem. The number of test cases `a` does not affect the possibility of achieving the desired number of cubes with the given moves. This condition is incorrect.
   - **Condition 4**: `else`
     - This condition prints 'No' if none of the previous conditions are met. However, since the previous conditions cover all possible scenarios, this condition is redundant and should be removed.

The function summary correctly describes the behavior of the function, but it incorrectly includes the condition involving the parity of `a` and `b`. The correct logic should only involve checking if `b == c` or `b < c`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was incorrect because the conditions involving the parity of `a` and `b` are not relevant and do not correctly solve the problem. The corrected program only needs to check if `b == c` or `b < c`.

**Final: False**
