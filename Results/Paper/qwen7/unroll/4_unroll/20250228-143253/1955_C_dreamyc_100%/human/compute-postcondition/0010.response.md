Output State: **The program returns the sum of all indices `i` for which either the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `nums` is less than or equal to `math.ceil(k / 2)` or the sum of the last `i+1` elements of `nums` is less than or equal to `k // 2`.**

This means that the program will calculate the sum of indices where the cumulative sum of the first part of the list up to that index is less than or equal to `math.ceil(k / 2)`, or the cumulative sum of the latter part of the list starting from that index is less than or equal to `k // 2`. The exact value of the return will depend on the specific values of `nums`, `n`, and `k`.
