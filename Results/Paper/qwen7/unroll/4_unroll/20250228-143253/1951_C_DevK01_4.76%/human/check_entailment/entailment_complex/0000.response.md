Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly defines the function `func()` which processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.
2. It reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` along with the list `M` representing the ticket prices for each day.
4. The code sorts the list `M` and calculates the number of days `q` required to buy `k` tickets, considering the constraint `m` (maximum tickets per day).
5. It then calculates the cost based on the sorted list `N` of the first `q` elements of `M`. The cost calculation takes into account the increasing prices due to purchasing tickets on previous days.
6. The logic for calculating the cost seems to handle both scenarios where `n * m == k` and when it's not equal, ensuring that the cost is minimized.
7. The function correctly prints the cost for each test case without returning any value.

Given the detailed explanation and the logical flow of the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
