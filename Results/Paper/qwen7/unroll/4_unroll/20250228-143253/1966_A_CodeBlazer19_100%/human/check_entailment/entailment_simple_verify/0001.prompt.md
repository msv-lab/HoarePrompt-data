You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Example

    7 2
    
    4 2 1 100 5 2 3
    
    10 4
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5 2
    
    3 8 1 48 7
    
    6 2
    
    10 20 30 10 20 40
    
    6 3
    
    10 20 30 10 20 40

Output

    2
    1
    1
    3
    5
    1
    6
    
Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        if max(p) >= k:
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100. The list of integers c represents the numbers written on the cards, where each c_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        
        if max(p) >= k:
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed based on the conditions inside the loop. For each iteration of the loop (from 0 to t-1), if the maximum frequency of any number in the list `l` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k - 1` will be printed; otherwise, `n` will be printed. The exact sequence of these integers depends on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list of card numbers `l`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It creates a list `p` where each element is the count of occurrences of a unique card number in `l`.
   - This is done using a list comprehension that iterates over the unique elements in `l` and counts their occurrences.

3. **Checking Condition:**
   - The program checks if the maximum value in `p` (i.e., the highest count of any card number) is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - If true, it prints `k - 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `n`.

### Correctness Check

#### Test Case Analysis

1. **First Example Case:**
   - Input: `5 3 4 1 1 4 4`
   - Unique counts: `[2, 3]`
   - Maximum count: `3`
   - Since `3 >= 3`, it prints `3 - 1 = 2` (Correct).

2. **Second Example Case:**
   - Input: `1 10 7`
   - Unique counts: `[7]`
   - Maximum count: `7`
   - Since `7 >= 10` is false, it prints `1` (Correct).

3. **Third Example Case:**
   - Input: `7 2 4 2 1 100 5 2 3`
   - Unique counts: `[1, 2, 1, 1]`
   - Maximum count: `2`
   - Since `2 >= 2`, it prints `2 - 1 = 1` (Correct).

4. **Fourth Example Case:**
   - Input: `10 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Unique counts: `[10]`
   - Maximum count: `10`
   - Since `10 >= 4`, it prints `4 - 1 = 3` (Correct).

5. **Fifth Example Case:**
   - Input: `5 2 3 8 1 48 7`
   - Unique counts: `[1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Maximum count: `1`
   - Since `1 < 2`, it prints `5` (Correct).

6. **Sixth Example Case:**
   - Input: `6 2 10 20 30 10 20 40`
   - Unique counts: `[2, 2, 1]`
   - Maximum count: `2`
   - Since `2 >= 2`, it prints `2 - 1 = 1` (Correct).

7. **Seventh Example Case:**
   - Input: `6 3 10 20 30 10 20 40`
   - Unique counts: `[2, 2, 1]`
   - Maximum count: `2`
   - Since `2 >= 3` is false, it prints `6` (Correct).

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program against the provided examples, we see that the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of cards left after performing the specified operations. Therefore, the program is correct.
