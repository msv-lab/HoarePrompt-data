Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Here is the breakdown of the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - However, the logic inside `func_1` does not correctly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates from 2 to \(\sqrt{n}\), which is not relevant to the problem's constraints.
   - The variable `cnt` is set to \(i \times i\), and `ans` is incremented based on this value, which does not reflect the required condition.

3. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The current implementation does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - It instead seems to be counting something else, likely related to the square root of \(n\), which is unrelated to the problem.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the given condition. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\). Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
