Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^3; `u2vs` is a list of n lists where each list contains up to n-1 elements representing the indices of other lists it is connected to through pairs `(u, v)` entered during the loop's iterations; `d` is the result of the BFS starting from index 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the result of the function `func_1(d)` to the variable `a`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, `u2vs` remains a list of n lists where each list contains up to n-1 elements representing the indices of other lists it is connected to, and `d` remains the result of the BFS starting from index 0.
