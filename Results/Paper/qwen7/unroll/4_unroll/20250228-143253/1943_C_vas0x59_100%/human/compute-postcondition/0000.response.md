Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^3, u2vs is a list of length n where each element is a list of integers representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree, n is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the integer input received, while the list `u2vs` remains unchanged. The precondition that `n` is an integer within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^3) and that `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list of integers representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree is preserved.
