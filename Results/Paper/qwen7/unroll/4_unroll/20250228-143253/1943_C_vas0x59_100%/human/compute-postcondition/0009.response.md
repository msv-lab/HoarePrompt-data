Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^3, `u2vs` is a list of n lists where each list contains up to n-1 elements representing the indices of other lists it is connected to through pairs `(u, v)`, `d` is the result of the BFS starting from index 0, `d` is now updated with the result of the BFS, and `previous` is a variable holding the previous node information from the BFS; `path_ba` is a list containing the element `b`.**

Explanation: The line `path_ba = [b]` creates a new list `path_ba` and assigns it the value `[b]`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, or `previous`. The only change is the creation of the list `path_ba` which contains the single element `b`.
