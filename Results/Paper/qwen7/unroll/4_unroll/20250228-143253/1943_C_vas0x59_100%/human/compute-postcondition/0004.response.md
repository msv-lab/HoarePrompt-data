Output State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^3; `u2vs` is a list of n lists where each list contains up to n-1 elements representing the indices of other lists it is connected to through pairs `(u, v)` entered during the loop's iterations. Each element in the lists is one less than its actual value due to the `- 1` operation in the code.
