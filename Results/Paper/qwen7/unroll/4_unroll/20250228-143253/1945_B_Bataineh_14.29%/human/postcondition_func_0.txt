The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) (each between 1 and \(10^{18}\)). If \(m\) is less than both \(a\) and \(b\), it prints 2. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the value of \(\frac{m}{a} + \frac{m}{b} + 2\). After processing all test cases, it outputs a series of results, one per line, corresponding to each test case.
