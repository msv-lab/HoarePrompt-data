Output State: The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case based on the conditions provided in the loop. For each test case defined by the input values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it will print 'NO', otherwise it will print 'YES'. The total number of 'YES' and 'NO' outputs will depend on the inputs provided for each test case.
