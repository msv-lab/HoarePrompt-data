Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly simulate the game as described. Here's why:

1. **Game Rules Not Followed**: 
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, and then delete it from `a`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and delete it.
   - The program does not simulate these rules. Instead, it simply counts the occurrences of each number in the array and checks for the smallest missing index or the smallest index that appears exactly once after its first occurrence.

2. **Optimal Strategy Ignored**:
   - The optimal strategy involves both players making moves that affect the MEX value of `c`. The current implementation does not account for the alternating turns and the strategic choices of picking elements.
   - For example, in the first test case, the optimal strategy would involve Alice and Bob making specific choices to achieve the desired MEX value, but the current program does not simulate this.

3. **Output Mismatch**:
   - The output for the given examples does not match the expected results. The program does not produce the correct MEX values for the given test cases.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and does not follow the optimal strategy required for the problem.

Correctness: **False**
