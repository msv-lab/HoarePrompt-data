Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Game Logic Misinterpretation**: The problem specifies that Alice and Bob play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively. However, the provided code simply finds the smallest missing index or the smallest index that appears exactly once in the array `arr`. This does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob nor the optimal strategy they would employ.

2. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The optimal strategy involves Alice and Bob making moves that affect the MEX value in their favor. The current implementation does not simulate these moves or consider the sequence of turns.

3. **Output Interpretation**: The current implementation outputs the smallest missing index or the smallest index that appears exactly once in the array `arr`. This is not the same as finding the MEX of the array `c` formed by Alice's and Bob's optimal moves.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
