Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object involved here is the input value used in the `range` function, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as the input value is a positive integer. Given the constraints, the input value must be within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).

3. **Adjust the initial state**: Since the loop depends on the input value, the initial state must ensure that this input value is within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value itself, ensuring it is a positive integer within the given range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4**
