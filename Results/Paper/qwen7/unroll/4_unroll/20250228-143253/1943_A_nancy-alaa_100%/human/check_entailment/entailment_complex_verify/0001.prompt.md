You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

    #State: Output State: The output is the smallest missing index in the array `arr` or the smallest index that appears exactly once in `arr` after the first occurrence of such an index. If no such index exists, it outputs -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it finds and prints either the smallest missing index in the array or the smallest index that appears exactly once in the array after its first occurrence. If no such index exists, it prints -1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, who play optimally on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice picks elements from `a` and appends them to her array `c`, while Bob only removes elements.
   - The goal is to find the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of `c` at the end of the game.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob aims to minimize the MEX of `c`.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - If there are no duplicates in `a`, the MEX will be `n` because all numbers from `0` to `n-1` will be present in `c`.
   - If there are duplicates, the presence of a duplicate can affect the MEX value. Specifically, if a number appears exactly once, it can be used by Alice to increase the MEX.

4. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The code uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through numbers from `0` to `n+1` to find the smallest missing number (`i`) that is not in `mpp.keys()` (i.e., not in `arr`).
   - However, the logic for handling duplicates and ensuring optimal play is flawed.

5. **Flaws in the Given Code:**
   - The code does not account for the optimal strategy where Alice and Bob would strategically pick elements.
   - It does not handle the scenario where Alice can use the presence of duplicates to her advantage.
   - The code does not ensure that Alice maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it.

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - Alice should try to create gaps in the sequence by picking elements strategically.
   - Bob should remove elements to prevent Alice from creating large gaps.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.
