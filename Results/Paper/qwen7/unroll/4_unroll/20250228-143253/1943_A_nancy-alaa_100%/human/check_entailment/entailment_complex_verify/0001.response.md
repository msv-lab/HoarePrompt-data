### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, who play optimally on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice picks elements from `a` and appends them to her array `c`, while Bob only removes elements.
   - The goal is to find the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of `c` at the end of the game.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob aims to minimize the MEX of `c`.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - If there are no duplicates in `a`, the MEX will be `n` because all numbers from `0` to `n-1` will be present in `c`.
   - If there are duplicates, the presence of a duplicate can affect the MEX value. Specifically, if a number appears exactly once, it can be used by Alice to increase the MEX.

4. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The code uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through numbers from `0` to `n+1` to find the smallest missing number (`i`) that is not in `mpp.keys()` (i.e., not in `arr`).
   - However, the logic for handling duplicates and ensuring optimal play is flawed.

5. **Flaws in the Given Code:**
   - The code does not account for the optimal strategy where Alice and Bob would strategically pick elements.
   - It does not handle the scenario where Alice can use the presence of duplicates to her advantage.
   - The code does not ensure that Alice maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it.

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - Alice should try to create gaps in the sequence by picking elements strategically.
   - Bob should remove elements to prevent Alice from creating large gaps.

7. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code states that the function finds and prints either the smallest missing index in the array `arr` or the smallest index that appears exactly once in the array after the first occurrence of such an index. This is not the same as finding the MEX in the context of the game.
   - The logic in the annotated code is still flawed because it does not consider the strategic play of both players.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The given code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
