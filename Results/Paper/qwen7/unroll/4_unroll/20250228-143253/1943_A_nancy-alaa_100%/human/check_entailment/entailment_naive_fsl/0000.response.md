Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not simulate the game correctly according to the problem description. Specifically, the program assumes that the MEX of the array `c` can be determined solely by checking the presence of numbers in the counter `mpp`. However, the game involves strategic moves by both players, where Alice tries to maximize the MEX and Bob tries to minimize it. The current implementation does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob and their strategic choices.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
```

The correct output should be 2, as explained in the problem statement. However, the provided program would incorrectly output 0 because it only checks for the presence of numbers in the counter without considering the turns taken by Alice and Bob.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the game turns and ensure that Alice and Bob make optimal moves. The current implementation does not handle this logic, making it incorrect.
