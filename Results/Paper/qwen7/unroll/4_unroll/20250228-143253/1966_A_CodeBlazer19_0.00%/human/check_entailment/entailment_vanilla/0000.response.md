Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program only prints `k - 1` for each test case without considering the actual numbers on the cards or performing any operations as described in the problem statement.

3. **Checking the Problem Statement:**
   - According to the problem, we need to find the minimum number of cards left after performing the specified operations.
   - The operations involve selecting `k` cards with the same number and exchanging them for `k-1` new cards.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of cards left, not just print `k - 1`.

4. **Examples Provided:**
   - In the examples, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards left. For instance, in the first example, the output should be `2`, but the program outputs `2` (which is `k - 1`), which is not necessarily the minimum number of cards left.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem correctly. It simply prints `k - 1` for each test case, which is not the intended behavior.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
