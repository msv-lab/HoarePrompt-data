Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem description, the goal is to minimize the number of cards in the hand by exchanging groups of `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` new cards. However, the program simply prints `k - 1` regardless of the input, which is clearly incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```
The correct output should be `2`, as explained in the problem statement. However, the program will output `2` for this input, which is correct, but it will also output `2` for many other incorrect inputs, such as:
```
5 3
1 1 1 1 1
```
In this case, the correct output should be `1` because all cards have the same number, and we can exchange all five cards for four new ones, and then exchange those four for three, and so on, until only one card remains. The program, however, will output `2`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is thus incorrect.
