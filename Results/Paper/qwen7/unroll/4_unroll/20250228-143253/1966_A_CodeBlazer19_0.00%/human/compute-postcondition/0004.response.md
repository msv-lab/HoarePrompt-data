Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t, followed by pairs of integers n and k, and a list of n integers. It then prints the value k - 1 for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ends with t lines of output, each containing the value k - 1 from the corresponding test case.**
