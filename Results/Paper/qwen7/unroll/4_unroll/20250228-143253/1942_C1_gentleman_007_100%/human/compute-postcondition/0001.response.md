Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer; `prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where every element is initially set to True; `Highest_Prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where every element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `Highest_Prime` as a list of length `num + 1` with each element set to 0. This does not affect the values of `num` or the `prime` list. Therefore, the `prime` list remains unchanged, and `num` also remains unchanged.
