The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon, and `m` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. The function generates a list `l` of size `n + 1`, where each sublist at index `i` (from 1 to `n`) contains two elements: the first element is a vertex `x` returned by the function `func_1()`, and the second element is a distinct integer `y` between 1 and `n`. The list `l[0]` remains empty.
