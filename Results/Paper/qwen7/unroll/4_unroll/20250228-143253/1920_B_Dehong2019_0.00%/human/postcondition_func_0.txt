The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers t, n, k, x, and an array a of n integers. For each test case, it sorts the array a in non-increasing order, calculates two values (ans1 and ans2) based on specified operations involving elements of the array, and determines the maximum value between these two. Finally, it prints the maximum value obtained for each test case.
