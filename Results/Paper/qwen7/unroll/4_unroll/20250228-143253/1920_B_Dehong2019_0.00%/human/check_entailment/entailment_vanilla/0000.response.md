Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic for the game described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` followed by the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This is crucial because Alice will want to remove the largest elements, and Bob will want to negate the smallest elements to minimize the sum.

3. **Calculating Initial Sum:**
   - The initial sum `ans1` is calculated as the sum of all elements in the sorted array.

4. **Negating Elements:**
   - The program iterates through the first `x` elements of the sorted array and subtracts twice their value from `ans1`. This simulates Bob negating these elements.

5. **Removing Elements:**
   - The program then iterates through the first `k` elements of the sorted array and adds their values to `ans1`. It also subtracts twice the value of the corresponding element in the remaining part of the array (if within bounds). This simulates Alice removing these elements.

6. **Finding the Optimal Result:**
   - The program keeps track of the maximum possible sum (`ans`) by comparing `ans1` and `ans2` at each step.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The initial sum `ans1` is correctly calculated as the sum of all elements in the sorted array.

2. **Negation Logic:**
   - Negating the first `x` elements is correct because Bob wants to minimize the sum, so he would ideally negate the smallest elements.

3. **Removal Logic:**
   - Removing the first `k` elements is correct because Alice wants to maximize the sum, so she would ideally remove the largest elements.

4. **Optimal Sum Calculation:**
   - The program correctly updates `ans1` by adding and subtracting elements in a way that considers both Alice's and Bob's actions.

5. **Final Result:**
   - The final result is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, which ensures that the optimal sum is found.

### Conclusion:

The given Python program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob make their moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
