State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution condition.
4. The initial state of `t` being an input integer does not guarantee that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to ensure `t > 0`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
