You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). For each test case, it checks if the sum of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is even. If the sum is odd, it prints \(-1\). Otherwise, it calculates two values: \(x\) as half the sum of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (rounded down), and \(y\) as the sum of \(a\) and \(b\). It then prints the smaller of these two values. The function reads the number of test cases from the input and repeats this process for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Checking Parity:**
   - The program checks if the sum `(a + b + c)` is even. This is necessary because the total points must be even since each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 1 point to each player in a draw.
   - If the sum is odd, the program prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This check is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Calculating Total Points:**
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of games played, as each game contributes 2 points (or 1 point to each player in a draw).
   - It then calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the total points scored by the first two players combined.

4. **Determining Maximum Draws:**
   - The program prints `min(x, y)`, which is intended to represent the maximum possible number of draws.
   - However, this logic is flawed. The correct approach should consider the distribution of points among the players and ensure that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.

### Example Analysis:

Let's manually check the examples provided in the problem statement:

- **Example 1:** `0 0 0`
  - Sum is `0`, which is even.
  - `x = 0`, `y = 0`.
  - `min(0, 0) = 0`.
  - Correct output: `0`.

- **Example 2:** `0 1 1`
  - Sum is `2`, which is even.
  - `x = 1`, `y = 1`.
  - `min(1, 1) = 1`.
  - Correct output: `1`.

- **Example 3:** `1 1 1`
  - Sum is `3`, which is odd.
  - Correct output: `-1`.

- **Example 4:** `1 1 2`
  - Sum is `4`, which is even.
  - `x = 2`, `y = 2`.
  - `min(2, 2) = 2`.
  - Correct output: `2`.

- **Example 5:** `3 3 3`
  - Sum is `9`, which is odd.
  - Correct output: `-1`.

- **Example 6:** `3 4 5`
  - Sum is `12`, which is even.
  - `x = 6`, `y = 7`.
  - `min(6, 7) = 6`.
  - Correct output: `6`.

- **Example 7:** `1 1 10`
  - Sum is `12`, which is even.
  - `x = 6`, `y = 2`.
  - `min(6, 2) = 2`.
  - Correct output: `2`.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. The logic `min(x, y)` is incorrect because it does not account for the distribution of points among the players. Therefore, the program will produce incorrect results for many test cases.

Correctness: **False**
