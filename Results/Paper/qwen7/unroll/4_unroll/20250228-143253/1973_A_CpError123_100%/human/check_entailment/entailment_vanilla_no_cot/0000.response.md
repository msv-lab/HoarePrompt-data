Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. Here's why:

1. **Score Calculation**: The total score (sum of `a`, `b`, and `c`) must be even for the scores to be consistent. This part is correctly checked.
2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The logic to find the maximum number of draws is flawed. The current approach calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2` and `y` as `a + b`. Then, it prints `min(x, y)`, which does not necessarily give the maximum number of draws.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following:
- Each game can result in either 2 points being distributed (1 win, 1 loss) or 2 points being shared (2 draws).
- We need to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the scores are consistent.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Total points from games
        total_points = a + b + c
        
        # Maximum possible points from wins (2 points per game)
        max_points_from_wins = 2 * (a + b + c) // 2
        
        # Minimum points needed from draws (1 point per draw for each player)
        min_points_from_draws = 2 * (a + b + c) // 2 - total_points
        
        # Calculate maximum draws
        max_draws = min(min_points_from_draws, (total_points - max_points_from_wins) // 2)
        
        print(max_draws)

func()
```

This solution ensures that the maximum number of draws is calculated correctly by considering the distribution of points from wins and draws.
