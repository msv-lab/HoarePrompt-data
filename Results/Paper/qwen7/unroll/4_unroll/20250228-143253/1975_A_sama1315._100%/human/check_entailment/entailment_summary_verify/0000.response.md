Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the function summaries to understand why the original assessment might be incorrect.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
The function `func_1` takes an array `a` and checks if there exists a way to split the array into two parts and concatenate them in reverse order to match a sorted version of the array. This approach is flawed because it only checks for rotations (i.e., cyclic permutations) of the array, not valid splits and swaps.

For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. If we were to split this array into `[1, 1, 4]` and `[5, 1, 4]` and concatenate them in reverse order, we get `[5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4]`, which is not sorted. The function `func_1` would incorrectly return "Yes" because it checks for rotations rather than valid splits and swaps.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results.

### Correctness of the Original Assessment:
The original assessment stated that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. However, the assessment is based on the assumption that `func_1` is the primary function responsible for determining the correctness of the array transformation. 

Upon closer inspection, the original assessment overlooks the fact that `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case. The issue lies with `func_1`, which does not correctly implement the logic for checking valid splits and swaps.

### Conclusion:
While `func_1` is indeed flawed, the overall program structure and the handling of multiple test cases in `func_2` are correct. Therefore, the original assessment should be overturned because the program as a whole is capable of processing test cases correctly, even though `func_1` needs improvement.

Final: **False**
