Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. Specifically, `func_1` checks if the array can be split and rearranged to match a sorted version of itself, but this is not sufficient. The function does not ensure that the array can be split in such a way that the resulting array is non-decreasing.

For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. According to the problem description, we need to check if we can split the array into two parts and swap them to make the array non-decreasing. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly. The function `func_1` checks if any rotation of the array matches the sorted version, which is not the same as checking if the array can be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order.

To illustrate, the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]` cannot be made non-decreasing by any valid split and swap operation, but the current implementation would incorrectly return "Yes" because it checks for rotations rather than valid splits and swaps.
