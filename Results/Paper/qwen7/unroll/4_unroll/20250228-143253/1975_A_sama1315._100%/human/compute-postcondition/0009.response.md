Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (number of test cases) such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, an integer `n` (length of the array) such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and an array `a` of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. For each test case, it performs some unspecified operation on the array `a` and returns the results accordingly.**

Note: The specific operation on the array `a` is not detailed in the given information, so the functionality focuses on the structure and nature of the input rather than the exact computation performed.
