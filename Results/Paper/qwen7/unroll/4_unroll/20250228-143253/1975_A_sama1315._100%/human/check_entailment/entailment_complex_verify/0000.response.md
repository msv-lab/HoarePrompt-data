### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's analyze the provided code and the problem statement to understand why.

#### Problem Statement Analysis:
- The goal is to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
- The function `func_1` currently checks if any rotation of the array matches the sorted version of the array. This is not equivalent to checking if the array can be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` takes an array `a` and checks if any rotation of `a` matches the sorted version of `a`.
- It does this by creating a concatenated version of `a` (`a + a`) and then checking if any subsequence of this concatenated version matches the sorted version of `a`.

#### Example Analysis:
- Consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`.
  - The sorted version is `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`.
  - Concatenating `a` with itself gives `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`.
  - Checking if any subsequence of this concatenated version matches the sorted version will find a match (e.g., `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]` from indices 2 to 7).
  - Therefore, `func_1` will return `'Yes'`.

However, this does not mean the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. The array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]` cannot be made non-decreasing by any valid split and swap operation.

#### Correct Approach:
- To solve the problem correctly, we need to check if the array can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-decreasing and the second part is non-decreasing, and the last element of the first part is less than or equal to the first element of the second part.

#### Conclusion:
- The current implementation in `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. It checks for rotations instead of valid splits and swaps.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
