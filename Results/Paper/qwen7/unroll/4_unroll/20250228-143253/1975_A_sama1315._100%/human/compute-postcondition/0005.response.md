Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `idx` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `idx` is still 2 and `t` is still an integer equal to `int(data[0])`. The new variable `results` is introduced as an empty list.
