### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function checks if the given array `a` can be transformed into a non-decreasing sequence by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - It works by sorting the array `a` and then checking if any subsequence of the concatenated array (`a + a`) matches the sorted array.
   - However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly handle the requirement of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them. Instead, it checks if the entire array can be a subsequence of a repeated version of itself, which is not the intended logic.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The logic in `func_2` is correct in terms of reading input and calling `func_1`, but since `func_1` has a flawed logic, the overall program will produce incorrect results.

3. **Example Test Cases:**
   - For the given examples:
     - **Test Case 1:** `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
       - Expected: `No`
       - Actual: `No` (Correct)
     - **Test Case 2:** `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
       - Expected: `Yes`
       - Actual: `No` (Incorrect)
     - **Test Case 3:** `[1, 2, 3]`
       - Expected: `Yes`
       - Actual: `No` (Incorrect)

Since `func_1` does not correctly implement the required logic, the overall program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
