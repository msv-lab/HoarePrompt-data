State: **`idx` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, results is an empty list** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `_` and `t`.
2. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
3. The variable `idx` is not used in the loop condition or within the loop body, so it does not need to be adjusted.
4. The variable `results` is not used in the loop condition or within the loop body, so it does not need to be adjusted.
5. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, which must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
