Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of elements to remove for the array to stop being beautiful. Specifically, the logic for determining `minn` does not account for the requirement to find the smallest segment that can be removed to break the beauty condition.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
2
6
1 2 1 2 1 2
4
3 3 3 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
-1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
1
1
```

The program incorrectly identifies that removing one element from `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]` makes it non-beautiful, but it fails to recognize that removing just one element from `[3, 3, 3, 3]` cannot break the beauty condition since all elements are already the same.

The program needs to correctly identify the smallest segment that can be removed to break the beauty condition, which is not achieved by the current logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
