Reasoning:
The provided program aims to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same number. However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. **Initialization and Incrementation**: The variable `same` is incremented only when the current element matches `num`, which might not correctly capture the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same number. For instance, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the logic would incorrectly count the first segment of `1`s as `1` instead of `3`.

2. **Handling the End of Segments**: The logic does not properly handle the end of segments where the next element is different. The variable `minn` should be updated when a new segment starts, but the current implementation does not ensure this.

3. **Final Check**: The final check for `minn` should consider the last segment of consecutive elements, but the current implementation does not account for this.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
