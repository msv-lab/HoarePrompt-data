Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \) (where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq n \)). It calculates the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same number in the array \( a \). If no such segment exists, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the length of the shortest such segment. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
