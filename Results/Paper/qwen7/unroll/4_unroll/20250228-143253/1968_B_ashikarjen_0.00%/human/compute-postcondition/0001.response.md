Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is assigned the value of the first integer input split by space; m is an integer such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; a is the string input from the user.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of the string input from the user, which could be any string. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
