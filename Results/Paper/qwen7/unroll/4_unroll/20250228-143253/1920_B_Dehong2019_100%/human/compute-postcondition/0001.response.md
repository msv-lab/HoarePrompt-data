Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This sets `t` as a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The other conditions and lists remain unchanged as they are not involved in this operation.
