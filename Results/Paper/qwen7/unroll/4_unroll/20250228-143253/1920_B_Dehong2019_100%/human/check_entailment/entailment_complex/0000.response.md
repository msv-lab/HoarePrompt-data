### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for each test case, including the number of elements `n`, the removal limit `k`, the negation limit `x`, and the list of integers `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array**: The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This step is crucial because it allows Alice to remove the smallest elements first, which helps her maximize the sum, and Bob to negate the largest elements first, which helps him minimize the sum.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation**: The initial sum `ans1` is calculated as the sum of the sorted array. This is a starting point for further adjustments.

4. **Negation Operations**: The program iterates over the first `x` elements of the sorted array and subtracts twice their value from `ans1`. This simulates Bob's optimal strategy of negating the largest elements first.

5. **Removal Operations**: The program then iterates over the first `k` elements of the sorted array and adds their values to `ans1` and subtracts twice their value from `ans1` if they are within the range of the negations. This simulates Alice's optimal strategy of removing the smallest elements first.

6. **Maximization**: The variable `ans2` keeps track of the maximum possible sum after considering both Alice's and Bob's optimal strategies. It updates `ans2` with the maximum value between the current `ans1` and the previous `ans2`.

7. **Output**: The program prints the value of `ans2` for each test case, which represents the maximum possible sum of the array after the game.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly implements the described game rules and computes the optimal sum for each test case.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**
