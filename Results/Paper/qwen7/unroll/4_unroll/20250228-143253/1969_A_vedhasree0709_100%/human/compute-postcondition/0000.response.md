Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is `_`, which is a placeholder for the loop counter. However, since it is a placeholder, we don't need to explicitly adjust its state.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer.
   - Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer (which it is, given the constraints), no adjustment is needed for `t`.
   - The other variables (`n` and `p`) are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be considered for the loop to execute is the value of `t`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000**
