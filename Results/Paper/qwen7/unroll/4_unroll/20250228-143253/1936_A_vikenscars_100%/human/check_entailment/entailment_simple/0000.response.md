### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. The allowed operations involve comparing the bitwise OR of pairs of elements.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The bitwise OR operation (\(|\)) will always produce a non-zero result if at least one bit is set in either operand.
   - The bitwise XOR operation (\(\oplus\)) will maximize when the bits differ between the two operands.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function asks a query and returns the result of the comparison between the bitwise ORs of the specified pairs.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function aims to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\).

4. **Algorithm Breakdown**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the index `max_item_idx` such that the bitwise OR of the element at `max_item_idx` with itself is less than the bitwise OR of the element at `i` with itself for some `i`.
   - **Step 2**: For each candidate `i`, check if the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` with itself is less than the bitwise OR of `i` with itself. If so, update `pair_idx` to `i`.
   - **Step 3**: For each candidate `i`, check if the bitwise OR of `pair_idx` with itself is greater than the bitwise OR of `i` with itself. If so, update `pair_idx` to `i`.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The algorithm attempts to find the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` such that the bitwise OR of these indices with themselves is compared and updated accordingly.
   - The final step prints the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` which are supposed to maximize the bitwise XOR operation.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm correctly handles the case where the bitwise OR of the elements is used to compare and update indices.
   - The constraints and the number of queries (at most \(3n\)) are respected.

7. **Verification**:
   - The provided example and the logic within the functions align with the problem requirements.
   - The approach ensures that the maximum XOR is found by leveraging the bitwise OR comparisons.

### Conclusion:
The given program appears to follow the logic required to solve the problem and respects the constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
