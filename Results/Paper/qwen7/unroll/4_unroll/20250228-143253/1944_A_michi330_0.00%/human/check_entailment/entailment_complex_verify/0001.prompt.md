You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, where each line contains either "1" or "n - 1". Specifically, for each iteration of the loop, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the output will be "1", otherwise it will be "n - 1". Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified, the output can vary based on user input during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases defined by the number of tests `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. Based on the value of `k` relative to `n-1`, it outputs either "1" or "n-1". The final state of the program consists of `t` lines of output, each containing either "1" or "n-1" depending on the condition met by `k` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys at most `k` bridges.
   - Initially, there are `n` islands, and every pair of islands is connected by a bridge.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, it prints `1`. Otherwise, it prints `n-1`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - If `k >= n-1`:
     - This means that Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1 from all other islands. Thus, Everule can only visit island 1.
     - The program correctly outputs `1` in this case.
   - If `k < n-1`:
     - This means that Dominater cannot isolate island 1 from all other islands because there are fewer than `n-1` bridges to destroy.
     - Since every pair of islands is initially connected, Everule can still visit all `n` islands.
     - The program correctly outputs `n-1` in this case, which is the number of islands excluding the starting island (island 1).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `k` is exactly `n-1` and where `k` is less than `n-1` correctly.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is zero, which should result in `n-1` islands being reachable.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit based on the value of `k`.
