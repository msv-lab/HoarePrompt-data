Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). However, the program simply sorts the array in ascending order and prints it. This approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array.

To maximize the beauty, we should place the largest element at the beginning and the smallest at the end, and sort the rest in a way that maximizes the differences. Specifically, we can alternate the largest and smallest remaining elements.

Let's analyze the provided example:

1. For the input:
   ```
   5
   3
   2 1 3
   ```
   The program sorts `[2, 1, 3]` to `[1, 2, 3]`, resulting in a beauty of \( (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 \), which is correct.

2. For the input:
   ```
   3
   69 69 69
   ```
   The program sorts `[69, 69, 69]` to `[69, 69, 69]`, resulting in a beauty of \( 0 \), which is correct.

3. For the input:
   ```
   5
   100 54 80 43 90
   ```
   The program sorts `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]` to `[54, 80, 90, 100, 43]`, resulting in a beauty of \( (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) + (43 - 100) = 26 + 10 + 10 - 57 = -1 \), which is incorrect.

The correct approach would involve sorting the array and then arranging the elements such that the differences are maximized. Therefore, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
