Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). However, the provided function simply sorts the array and prints it. This does not maximize the beauty of the array according to the given definition.

To find the maximum beauty, we should arrange the array such that the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are maximized. The optimal strategy is to place the smallest element at the beginning and the largest element at the end, and then alternate between the smallest and largest remaining elements. This ensures that the differences are maximized.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
