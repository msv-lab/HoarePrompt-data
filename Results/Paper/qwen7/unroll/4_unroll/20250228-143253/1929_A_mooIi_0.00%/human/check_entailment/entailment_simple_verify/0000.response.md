### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code:

1. **Problem Description**: The goal is to find the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

2. **Given Code**:
   ```python
   def func():
       for _ in range(int(input())):
           n = int(input())
           ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
           print(' '.join(ar))
   ```

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \(n\) and the array elements.
   - It then sorts the array and converts the sorted integers to strings.
   - Finally, it prints the sorted array as a string.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The assessment states that the program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty because sorting and printing the array does not maximize the beauty.
   - The assessment provides an example where sorting the array does not yield the maximum beauty.

### Analysis:

- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array arranges the elements in ascending or descending order. However, the beauty calculation depends on the differences between consecutive elements, not just their order.
- **Optimal Arrangement**: To maximize the beauty, we need to ensure that the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are maximized. Sorting the array does not necessarily achieve this. For instance, in the example given:
  - Input: `3 100 54 80`
  - Sorted: `[54, 80, 100]` → Beauty: \((80 - 54) + (100 - 80) = 26 + 20 = 46\)
  - Optimal: `[100, 54, 80]` → Beauty: \((100 - 54) + (80 - 100) = 46 - 20 = 26\)

- **Conclusion**: The original assessment is correct. Sorting the array and printing it does not guarantee the maximum beauty. The program needs to find a different approach to maximize the beauty, such as arranging the array in a specific order to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not maximize the beauty of the array as required by the problem statement.
