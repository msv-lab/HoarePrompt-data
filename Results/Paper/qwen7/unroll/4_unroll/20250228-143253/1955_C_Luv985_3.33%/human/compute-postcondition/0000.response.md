Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; the code block is an empty code block.**

The given code block is an empty code block, which means no operations are performed on the variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
