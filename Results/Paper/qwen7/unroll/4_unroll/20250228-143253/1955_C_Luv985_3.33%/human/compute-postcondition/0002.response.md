Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `T`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `while T:` will execute as long as `T` is non-zero.

3. **Current state before the loop**: The state given is that `T` is an input integer and it is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\).

4. **Determine the necessary adjustment**: For the loop to execute at least once, `T` must be non-zero. Since `T` is already stated to be a positive integer (which means \(T > 0\)), it is guaranteed to be non-zero.

Given this analysis, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`T` is an input integer and it is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\)**
