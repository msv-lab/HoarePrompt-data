Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and s and f are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, representing the initial and desired positions of the cats in the boxes, respectively. After executing all iterations of the loop, the output is determined based on the conditions within the loop. If the counts of '1's in s and t are equal, the output is the count of differing positions (cnt) if it is zero, otherwise it is zero. If the counts of '1's are different, the output is calculated as (cnt - d) // 2 + d, where d is the absolute difference between the counts of '1's in s and t. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
