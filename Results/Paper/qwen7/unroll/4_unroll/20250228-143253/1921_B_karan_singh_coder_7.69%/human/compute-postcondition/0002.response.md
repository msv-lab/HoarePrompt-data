Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and s and f are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, representing the initial and desired positions of the cats in the boxes, respectively. After executing the loop for all test cases, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The output for each test case is either the count of differing positions (cnt) adjusted by the difference in the number of '1's in s and f (d), or the absolute difference in the number of '1's (d) depending on whether the counts of '1's are equal or not, printed for each test case.
