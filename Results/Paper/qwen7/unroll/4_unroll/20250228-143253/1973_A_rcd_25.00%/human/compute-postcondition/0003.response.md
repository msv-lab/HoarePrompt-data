Output State: The output state depends on the input values provided for each iteration of the loop. For each input triplet (p1, p2, p3), the program checks if their sum is even. If not, it prints -1 and continues to the next iteration. If the sum is even, it further checks if p3 is greater than or equal to p1 + p2. If true, it prints p1 + p2. Otherwise, it calculates two values, low and high, based on p3, p1, and p2, and uses a while loop to find a value cur such that p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur). It then prints p1 - cur + p3. If no such cur is found, it prints p3.
