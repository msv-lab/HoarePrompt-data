Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`, the new state of `t` remains within this range, but its specific value is now determined by the user's input. The other conditions and constraints on `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged and are still valid.
