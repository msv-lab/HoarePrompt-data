Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each one.
2. It checks if the sum of \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) is even. If not, it prints \(-1\) as required, because an odd sum would mean the scores cannot be achieved with the given rules.
3. If the sum is even, it checks if \(p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2\). If this condition is true, it prints \(p_1 + p_2\). This is correct because if \(p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2\), it means all points from the games involving the third player could have come from draws or wins, and the maximum number of draws would be \(p_1 + p_2\).
4. If \(p_3 < p_1 + p_2\), it enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws. The logic in the loop is designed to find the largest \(cur\) such that \(p_1 - cur \leq p_2 - (p_3 - cur)\). This ensures that the number of draws is maximized while satisfying the constraints.
5. The function handles all given examples correctly, as shown in the execution summary.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
