### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the corrected program step-by-step to determine their correctness.

#### Given Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even for the given scoring rules.

3. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The program incorrectly checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. This condition does not necessarily mean that no draws are possible. Instead, it should calculate the minimum number of games required to achieve the given scores.

4. **Binary Search for Maximum Draws:**
   - The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum number of draws. However, the logic is overly complex and may not correctly handle all edge cases.

5. **Breaking Conditions:**
   - If the current number of draws (`cur`) satisfies the condition where `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks the loop.
   - If no valid number of draws is found, it prints `p3`.

#### Corrected Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even for the given scoring rules.

3. **Calculate Minimum Number of Games:**
   - The program calculates the minimum number of games required to achieve the given scores using `(total_points - 2 * p3) // 2`.

4. **Calculate Maximum Number of Draws:**
   - The program calculates the maximum number of draws by considering the constraints and ensuring the total points are consistent.

5. **Ensure Non-Negative Draws:**
   - The program ensures that the calculated number of draws is non-negative.

6. **Print Result:**
   - The program prints the maximum number of draws.

#### Evaluation:

- The given program has several issues, including incorrect handling of the initial condition and overly complex binary search logic.
- The corrected program correctly calculates the minimum number of games required and then determines the maximum number of draws based on these constraints.

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect due to its flawed logic and handling of the initial condition. The corrected program addresses these issues and provides the correct solution.

**Correctness:** False

Final: **False**
