You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers satisfying 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the input values provided for each iteration of the loop. For each input triplet (p1, p2, p3), the program checks if their sum is even. If not, it prints -1 and continues to the next iteration. If the sum is even, it further checks if p3 is greater than or equal to p1 + p2. If true, it prints p1 + p2. Otherwise, it calculates two values, low and high, based on p3, p1, and p2, and uses a while loop to find a value cur such that p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur). It then prints p1 - cur + p3. If no such cur is found, it prints p3.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on the constraints provided for t, p_1, p_2, and p_3. Specifically, t is a positive integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, and p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. The function does not use these constraints within its body but rather uses them to define the valid range of inputs for other operations or calculations that might be performed elsewhere.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
