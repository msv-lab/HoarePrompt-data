The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three non-negative integers \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) where \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\). For each test case, it first checks if the sum of \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) is even. If the sum is odd, it prints \(-1\) and moves to the next test case. If the sum is even, it further checks if \(p_3\) is greater than or equal to \(p_1 + p_2\). If true, it prints \(p_1 + p_2\). Otherwise, it finds a value \(cur\) such that \(p_1 - cur \leq p_2 - (p_3 - cur)\) and prints \(p_1 - cur + p_3\). If no such \(cur\) exists, it prints \(p_3\). The function outputs a series of numbers based on the conditions met by the input values for each test case.
