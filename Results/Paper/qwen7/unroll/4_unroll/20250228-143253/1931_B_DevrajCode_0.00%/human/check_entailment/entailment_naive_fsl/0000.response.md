Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Here’s a breakdown of why the program works for all potential cases:

1. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'No', which is correct because it’s impossible to distribute the water evenly if the total is not divisible by `n`.

2. **Target Calculation**: If the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, the program calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`total_water // n`).

3. **Balance Check**: The program then iterates through each container and checks if the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount accumulates to zero. If at any point the accumulated difference becomes negative, it means it’s impossible to balance the water, and the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

This approach ensures that the program handles all potential cases correctly. Since the sum of `a_i` is guaranteed to be divisible by `n`, the only way the program could fail is if the water cannot be evenly distributed, which is precisely what the program checks for. Therefore, the program is correct.
