### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to check if we can make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container's index is always less than the destination container's index.

2. **Key Insight**: Given that the sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers (`n`), it is theoretically possible to distribute the water evenly among the containers. This means each container should end up with `total_water / n` units of water.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`.
   - If the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, it returns 'No'.
   - If it is divisible, it calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It then iterates through each container and checks if the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount accumulates to a negative value. If it does, it means it's impossible to balance the water, and it returns 'No'.
   - If no such accumulation occurs, it returns 'Yes'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where the total amount of water is not divisible by `n` correctly.
   - The code also correctly checks if the water distribution can be balanced without accumulating a negative difference.

5. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The code reads input from standard input, which is fine for the given problem constraints.
   - The output format matches the required format.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:

**True**
