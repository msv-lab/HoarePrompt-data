The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where the sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`. It calculates the target amount of water each element should have (`total_water // n`). Then, it iterates through the list `a`, adjusting a cumulative difference (`container`) between the current element and the target. If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, the function returns 'No'. If the cumulative difference never goes negative, the function returns 'Yes'.
