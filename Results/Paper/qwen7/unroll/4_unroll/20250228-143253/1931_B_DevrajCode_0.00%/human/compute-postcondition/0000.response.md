Output State: **`total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `n` is a positive integer, and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that the sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `total_water`. The initial conditions about `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
