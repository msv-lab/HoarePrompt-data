Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome.
   - It works correctly by comparing the string with its reverse (`s[::-1]`).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to partition the string `s` into non-palindromic substrings.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition.
     - Otherwise, it iterates through the string to find the first character that differs from the first character.
     - If all characters are the same (indicating a palindrome), it prints "NO".
     - If a differing character is found, it checks if the substring starting from this index is a palindrome.
       - If the substring is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the partition into two parts.
       - If the substring is a palindrome, it further checks specific edge cases (e.g., when `x == 1` or `x == n // 2`) before deciding whether the partition is valid.

### Testing the Functionality:

1. **Test Case 1: `sinktheyacht`**
   - `sinktheyacht` is not a palindrome.
   - The function should print "YES" and the string itself as the partition.
   - This is handled correctly.

2. **Test Case 2: `lllllllll`**
   - All characters are the same, making the string a palindrome.
   - The function should print "NO".
   - This is handled correctly.

3. **Test Case 3: `uwuowouwu`**
   - The function should attempt to partition the string.
   - It finds that `uw` is not a palindrome, so it prints "YES" and the partition `uw uow ouwu`.
   - This is handled correctly.

### Edge Cases:
- The function handles the edge cases where the string is very short (e.g., single characters or strings with alternating characters).
- It also handles cases where the string is symmetric around the middle (e.g., `lllllllll`).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check for and partition the string into non-palindromic substrings based on the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
