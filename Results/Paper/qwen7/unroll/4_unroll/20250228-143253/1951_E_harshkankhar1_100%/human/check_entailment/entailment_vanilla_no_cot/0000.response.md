Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a string is a palindrome, which is unnecessary for the solution. The main logic should directly check for palindromes without needing a separate function.

2. **Handling of Palindromes**: The code attempts to split the string into two parts at the first position where the characters do not match. However, this approach is flawed because it doesn't guarantee that both parts will not be palindromes. For example, consider the string "aab". Splitting it at the first position would result in "a" and "ab", but "a" is a palindrome.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly. For instance, if the entire string is a palindrome, the code incorrectly returns "NO".

4. **General Logic**: The logic to determine if a partition can be made into non-palindromic substrings is incomplete and incorrect. It only considers splitting at the first mismatch and does not explore other possible splits.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to ensure that every substring in the partition is not a palindrome. Here's a revised version of the code:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def find_partition(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if not is_palindrome(s[:i]) and not is_palindrome(s[i:]):
            return True, i
    return False, -1

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        valid, split_point = find_partition(s)
        if valid:
            print("YES")
            print(2)
            print(s[:split_point], s[split_point:])
        else:
            print("NO")

solve()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
1. **Function `is_palindrome`**: Checks if a string is a palindrome.
2. **Function `find_partition`**: Tries to find a valid split point where neither part is a palindrome.
3. **Main Function `solve`**: Reads input, processes each test case, and prints the appropriate output based on whether a valid partition exists.

This approach ensures that the string is correctly partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
