### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summaries provided.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function correctly checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.
- Correct implementation.

#### Function `func_2`:
- The function aims to determine if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
- **Initial Analysis:**
  - The function first checks if the entire string is not a palindrome.
    - If true, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition.
    - This part is correct.
  - If the string is a palindrome, it looks for the first character that differs from the first character.
    - If all characters are the same, it prints "NO".
    - This part is correct.
  - If a differing character is found, it checks if the substring starting from this index is a palindrome.
    - If the substring is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the partition into two parts.
    - This part is correct.
  - If the substring is a palindrome, it further checks specific edge cases (e.g., when `x == 1` or `x == n // 2`).
    - The handling of these edge cases seems to be incorrect.

#### Detailed Edge Case Analysis:
- **Edge Case 1: `lllllllll`**
  - The function correctly identifies that the string is a palindrome and prints "NO".
- **Edge Case 2: `uwuowouwu`**
  - The function finds that `uw` is not a palindrome and prints "YES" and the partition `uw uow ouwu`.
  - However, the function should handle cases where the string is symmetric around the middle more robustly.
- **Edge Case 3: `a`**
  - The function should print "NO" because a single character is always a palindrome.
- **Edge Case 4: `ab`**
  - The function should print "YES" and the partition `a b`.

#### Specific Issues:
- The function incorrectly handles cases where the string is symmetric around the middle. For example, `lllllllll` should print "NO" instead of checking for further partitions.
- The function does not handle cases where the string has alternating characters correctly. For example, `ab` should print "YES" and the partition `a b`.

### Corrected Approach:
To correctly handle these edge cases, the function should:
1. Check if the entire string is a palindrome.
2. If not, print "YES" and the string itself.
3. If the string is a palindrome, check if it has alternating characters or is symmetric around the middle.
4. Handle other cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is partially correct but incomplete. The function does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly those involving symmetric strings and alternating characters.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the handling of edge cases.
