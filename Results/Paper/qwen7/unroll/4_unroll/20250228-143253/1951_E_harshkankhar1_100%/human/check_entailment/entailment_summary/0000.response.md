Reasoning:
1. **func_1** correctly checks if a given string is a palindrome.
2. **func_2** is responsible for determining if the input string can be partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes.
   - It first checks if the entire string is not a palindrome using `func_1`. If true, it prints "YES" and the string itself as a single partition.
   - If the entire string is a palindrome, it looks for the first character that is different from the first character. This helps in finding a point to split the string.
   - If such a character is found, it checks if the substring after this point is a palindrome. If not, it prints "YES" and the appropriate partitions.
   - If no such point is found or if the point is at the beginning or middle of the string, it prints "NO".

Given the logic in **func_2**, it correctly handles all the test cases provided:
- For "sinktheyacht", it correctly identifies that the whole string is not a palindrome and thus can be a single partition.
- For "lllllllll", it correctly identifies that every substring is a palindrome and thus cannot be partitioned as required.
- For "uwuowouwu", it correctly identifies that the string can be partitioned into "uw", "uow", and "ouwu".

Therefore, the implementation of **func_2** aligns with the problem statement and handles all scenarios appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
