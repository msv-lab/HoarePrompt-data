Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, and `n` is the length of the input string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The variable `n`, which was previously the length of the string `s`, is no longer updated because the length of the string is not recalculated. Therefore, `n` remains as the length of the original string `s`, which was part of the initial state.
