Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the input string `s`, and `x` is -1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n` and initializes `x` to -1. The initial state of `s` and `n` remains unchanged, and `x` is explicitly set to -1.
