Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character, or `-1` if all characters in `s` are the same. In this case, `x` is not equal to `-1`.
- The function `func_1` returns `False` when applied to the substring starting from `s[x + 1]`.

The `print(2)` statement simply prints the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
