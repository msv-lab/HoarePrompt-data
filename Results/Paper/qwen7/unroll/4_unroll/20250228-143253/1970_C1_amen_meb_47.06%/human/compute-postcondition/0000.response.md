Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains 1 integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `numbers` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `numbers`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, or the list of starting nodes. Therefore, the conditions for these variables remain the same as in the initial state.
