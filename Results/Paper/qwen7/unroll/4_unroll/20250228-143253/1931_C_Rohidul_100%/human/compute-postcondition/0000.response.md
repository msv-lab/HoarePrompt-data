Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in Python when the value of the loop variable is not needed. It is typically used for iterating over a range or a collection without using the actual values.

2. **Determine the conditions for loop execution**: The loop will execute based on the number of test cases provided by `input()`. The input is converted to an integer using `int(input())`, which means the loop will run as many times as the integer value provided by the user.

3. **Adjust the initial state**: Since the loop depends on the input from the user, the initial state must reflect that the input is a valid integer within the specified range. Additionally, since the loop will run for each test case, we need to ensure that the state is set up correctly for the first iteration.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input itself, ensuring it is a valid integer within the specified range.

**State:**
- The input must be a valid integer such that \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the final state is:
**State: **The input must be a valid integer such that \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\)**.
