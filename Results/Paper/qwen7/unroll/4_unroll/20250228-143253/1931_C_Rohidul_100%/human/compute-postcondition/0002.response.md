Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the array a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i. After executing the loop, ans is an integer representing the result of the computation based on the conditions given in the loop body, and it is printed for each test case. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
