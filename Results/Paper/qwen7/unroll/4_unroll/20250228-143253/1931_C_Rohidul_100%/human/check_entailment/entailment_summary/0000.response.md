Reasoning:
- The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying segments of the array where elements are the same and then calculating the minimum cost to make all elements equal.
- The logic in the program seems to identify the longest segment of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning (`st`) and ending from the end (`end`).
- The variable `ans` is calculated based on these segments:
  - `ans = le - max(st, end)` initially considers the length of the array minus the maximum length of the identified segments.
  - If the first and last elements are the same, it adjusts the calculation to account for overlapping segments correctly.
- The program correctly handles the edge cases where the entire array is already uniform or parts of the array are uniform.
- Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program appears to correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

Correctness: **True**
