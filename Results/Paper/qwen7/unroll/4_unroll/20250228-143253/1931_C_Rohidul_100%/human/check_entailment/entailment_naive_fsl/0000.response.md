Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where the array has multiple distinct values and the optimal operation involves selecting a subarray that includes the boundaries of different segments of these values.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The program will incorrectly calculate the result as `5` (the length of the array), but the correct answer should be `4`. This is because we can set the entire array to the value `1` using two operations: setting the first three elements to `1` and then setting the last two elements to `1`. The total cost would be `(3-1+1) + (5-3+1) = 4`.

The program's logic is flawed because it only checks the start and end of the array for equality and does not properly account for the minimum cost to make all elements equal. It fails to consider the optimal subarray that minimizes the cost for arrays with more than two distinct values.
