You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        flag = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each string `s` provided by the user, if the string is non-decreasing, the output is `count + 1`, otherwise, it is `count`. The variable `count` and `flag` are reset for each iteration of the outer loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the binary string has multiple segments of consecutive zeros or ones. For example, consider the input "010101". The program would incorrectly output 2, as it counts the transitions between different digits but does not account for the fact that the string can be split into "01" and "01", which can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. However, the correct answer should be 3, as the string can be split into "0", "10", and "1". This demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
