Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly maximize the total difference \(D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|\). The logic in the `for` loop where it tries to decide whether to use `b[-(n - i)]` or `b[i]` is flawed. It should instead aim to pair the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and vice versa to maximize the differences.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)
        
        # Pair the smallest elements of a with the largest elements of b
        ans = [abs(a[i] - b[i]) for i in range(n)]
        
        print(sum(ans))
```

This corrected version directly pairs the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and calculates the differences, ensuring the maximum possible total difference.
