Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the values in `b` are not sufficient to maximize the total difference `D`. Specifically, the program assumes that the largest `n` values in `b` can always be paired with the smallest `n` values in `a`, but this is not necessarily true. 

Consider the following test case:
```
3 5
1 2 3 4 5
8 7 6 5 4
```
In this case, the program would sort `a` as `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `b` as `[8, 7, 6, 5, 4]` in descending order. It then pairs the elements as follows:
- `|1-8| = 7`
- `|2-7| = 5`
- `|3-6| = 3`
- `|4-5| = 1`

Thus, the total difference `D` would be `7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 16`.

However, the optimal solution would be to pair the elements differently:
- Pair `1` with `4` (difference `3`)
- Pair `2` with `5` (difference `3`)
- Pair `3` with `6` (difference `3`)
- Pair `4` with `8` (difference `4`)

Thus, the total difference `D` would be `3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13`.

The program fails to consider this optimal pairing, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
