### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing each row in the list `a`.

2. **Row and Column Checks**:
   - The program constructs the `first_row` and `last_row` by concatenating the first and last characters of each row, respectively.
   - It checks if the first row is uniform (`len(set(a[0])) == 1`) and different from the last row (`a[0] != a[-1]`).
   - It also checks if the first row is uniform and different from the last row (`len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row`).

3. **Output Determination**:
   - If either of the above conditions is true, the program prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Analysis of the Given Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   ```
   2 1
   W
   B
   ```
   - The first row is "W" and the last row is "B".
   - Since they are different, the program prints "NO".

2. **Test Case 2**:
   ```
   6 6
   WWWWBW
   WBWWWW
   BBBWWW
   BWWWBB
   WWBWBB
   BBBWBW
   ```
   - The first row is "WWWWBW" and the last row is "BBBWBW".
   - Since they are different, the program prints "NO".

3. **Test Case 3**:
   ```
   1 1
   W
   ```
   - The grid is uniform, so the program prints "YES".

4. **Test Case 4**:
   ```
   2 2
   BB
   BB
   ```
   - The grid is uniform, so the program prints "YES".

5. **Test Case 5**:
   ```
   3 4
   BWBW
   WBWB
   BWBW
   ```
   - The first row is "BWBW" and the last row is "BWBW".
   - They are the same, so the program prints "YES".

6. **Test Case 6**:
   ```
   4 2
   BB
   BB
   WW
   WW
   ```
   - The first row is "BB" and the last row is "WW".
   - Since they are different, the program prints "NO".

7. **Test Case 7**:
   ```
   4 4
   WWBW
   BBWB
   WWBB
   BBBB
   ```
   - The first row is "WWBW" and the last row is "BBBB".
   - Since they are different, the program prints "NO".

8. **Test Case 8**:
   ```
   1 5
   WBBWB
   ```
   - The grid is uniform, so the program prints "YES".

### Evaluation of the Program:

The program correctly handles the test cases provided in the example. It checks if the first and last rows are uniform and different, which is a necessary condition for the grid to be non-uniform. However, the program does not fully cover all scenarios where the grid can become uniform through the allowed operations.

### Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:
```
3 3
BBB
BBB
BBB
```
- Here, all rows are uniform and identical.
- The program should print "YES" because it is possible to make all squares the same color (all black in this case).
- However, the program prints "NO" because the first and last rows are the same.

### Conclusion:

The program fails to handle the case where the entire grid is uniform, even though the first and last rows may be the same. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
