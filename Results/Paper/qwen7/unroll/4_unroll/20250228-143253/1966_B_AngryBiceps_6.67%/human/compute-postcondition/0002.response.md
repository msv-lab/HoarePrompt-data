Output State: The output state consists of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed based on the conditions checked within the loop for each test case. For each test case, if the first row is uniform and different from the last row, or if any row is uniform and different from its corresponding column's start and end characters, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. The number of 'YES' and 'NO' will depend on the input provided for each test case.
