Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to handle various special cases and then falls back to a general algorithm for calculating the number of sunk ships. However, the program is overly complex and relies heavily on hard-coded values and conditions, which makes it difficult to maintain and understand. More importantly, the program does not correctly simulate the attack pattern described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. **Special Cases Handling**: The program includes numerous hard-coded conditions that check for specific values of `n` and `k`. These conditions are not part of the general logic and do not reflect the actual attack pattern described.
2. **Attack Pattern Simulation**: The program should simulate the Kraken's attack pattern correctly. It should alternate between attacking the first and last ship until all ships are sunk. However, the current implementation does not accurately simulate this pattern.
3. **General Logic**: For the general case, the program should correctly simulate the attack pattern and count the number of ships sunk. The current implementation does not fully achieve this, as it does not correctly handle the alternating attack pattern and the decrement of ship durability.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements and thus is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
