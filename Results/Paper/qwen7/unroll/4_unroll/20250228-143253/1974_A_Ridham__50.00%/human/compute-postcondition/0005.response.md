Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `result` is a list containing integers calculated based on the input values of `x` and `y` for each iteration of the loop.

The `print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))` statement will join all elements of the `result` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). Since the exact values of `x`, `y`, and how they are used to calculate the elements of `result` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact content of the `result` list.

However, we know that each element of `result` is an integer. Therefore, the output will be a series of integers, each on a new line.

Output: **a series of integers, each on a new line (where each integer is part of the `result` list)**
