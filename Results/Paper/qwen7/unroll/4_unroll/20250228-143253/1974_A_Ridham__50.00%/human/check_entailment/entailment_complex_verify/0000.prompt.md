You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `result` is a list containing integers calculated based on the input values of `x` and `y` for each iteration of the loop.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: a series of integers, each on a new line (where each integer is part of the `result` list)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) followed by pairs of non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). For each pair of `x` and `y`, it calculates a specific output based on the values of `x` and `y`. If `space_x` (which is `x`) can fit within the remaining cells after accounting for `space_y` (which is `y * 4`), it appends the required number of screens (`screen_require_for_y`) to the result list. Otherwise, it calculates the additional screens needed (`extra_screen`) and appends the total number of screens required to the result list. Finally, it prints a series of integers, each representing the calculated result for each test case, with each integer on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of screens required. Specifically, the calculation of `remaining_cells` and the subsequent logic for determining the number of additional screens needed are flawed. 

For example, consider the test case `(x, y) = (12, 4)`:
- According to the problem, we need to fit 12 icons of size 1x1 and 4 icons of size 2x2.
- The total space required for 2x2 icons is `4 * 4 = 16` cells.
- The number of screens required for 2x2 icons is `4 // 2 + 1 = 3` (since 4 is odd, we need an additional screen).

However, the program calculates the remaining cells incorrectly and does not properly account for the placement of 1x1 icons. The correct approach would involve calculating how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.

A correct approach would be to first calculate the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons and then check if the remaining space can accommodate the 1x1 icons. Here's a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons
        screen_require_for_y = (y + 1) // 2
        # Calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4
        # Calculate the number of screens required for 1x1 icons
        extra_screens_for_x = (x + remaining_cells - 1) // remaining_cells
        result.append(screen_require_for_y + extra_screens_for_x)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of screens required is calculated accurately based on the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
