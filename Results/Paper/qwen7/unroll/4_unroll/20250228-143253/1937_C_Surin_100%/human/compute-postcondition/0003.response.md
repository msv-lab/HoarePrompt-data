Output State: The value of `prev` and `v1` are determined based on the comparisons made during the loop executions. Specifically, `v1` will hold the value of the last `i` where the condition `r == '<'` was met in the first inner loop, and `prev` will hold the value of the last `i` where the condition `r == '>'` was met in the second inner loop. If no such conditions were met, `v1` and `prev` will retain their initial value of 0.
