Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly maximize the XOR value \( p_i \oplus p_j \) within the allowed constraints. Here's why:

1. **Query Strategy**: The current strategy of comparing \( p_v \mid p_v \) with \( p_i \mid p_i \) and then trying to find the maximum OR value does not guarantee finding the maximum XOR value. This approach only checks for equality and inequality of OR values but does not necessarily lead to the maximum XOR.

2. **Lack of Exploration**: The solution does not explore all possible pairs effectively. It only compares certain fixed pairs repeatedly without a comprehensive exploration strategy.

3. **Incorrect Assumptions**: The logic assumes that the maximum XOR will be found by comparing OR values, which is not always true. The maximum XOR can occur between different pairs of elements, not just those with the same index.

### Correct Approach:
A better approach involves using the properties of XOR and OR operations to efficiently find the maximum XOR pair. One effective method is to use a divide-and-conquer strategy combined with querying the OR values in a structured manner.

Hereâ€™s a more detailed and correct approach:

1. **Divide and Conquer**: Divide the array into smaller segments and use the results of OR queries to narrow down the potential candidates for the maximum XOR.
2. **Efficient Querying**: Use the results of previous queries to strategically choose new queries that help identify the maximum XOR pair.

Below is a more refined version of the solution:

```python
import sys

def query(a, b, c, d):
    print(f'? {a} {b} {c} {d}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    return input()

def find_max_xor(n):
    def solve(start, end):
        if start == end:
            return start, start
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        left_max, left_index = solve(start, mid)
        right_max, right_index = solve(mid + 1, end)
        
        # Find the maximum XOR in the left and right halves
        max_xor = 0
        max_pair = (-1, -1)
        for i in range(left_index, left_index + 1):
            for j in range(right_index, right_index + 1):
                xor_val = query(i, i, j, j)
                if xor_val == '=':
                    continue
                if xor_val == '>':
                    max_xor = max(max_xor, query(i, i, mid, mid))
                    max_pair = (i, j)
                else:
                    max_xor = max(max_xor, query(mid, mid, j, j))
                    max_pair = (j, i)
        
        return max_xor, max_pair
    
    _, (i, j) = solve(0, n-1)
    print(f'! {i} {j}')
    sys.stdout.flush()

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    find_max_xor(n)
```

This solution uses a divide-and-conquer approach to efficiently find the maximum XOR pair while adhering to the query limit.
