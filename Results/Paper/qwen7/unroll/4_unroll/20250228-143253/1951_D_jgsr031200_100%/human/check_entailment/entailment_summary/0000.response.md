Reasoning:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the simplest case where `n == k`. It prints "YES", followed by 1 twice, which matches the problem statement.
   - For the case where `n < k`, the program correctly prints "NO", which also matches the problem statement.
   - For the more complex case where `n >= k`, the program attempts to split the coins into two stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. However, the logic used to determine the prices for the stalls is flawed.

2. **Flawed Logic**:
   - The program initializes `costs` as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - It then calculates the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in `costs` and checks if this sum is less than `k`. If it is, it prints "NO".
   - If the sum is not less than `k`, it prints "YES" and 2, followed by the elements of `costs`.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input `(255, 8)` from the example. The program should output "YES" and the prices for 8 stalls. However, the current logic only considers splitting the coins into two stalls, which is insufficient to cover the requirement of 8 stalls.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The program needs to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels across up to 60 stalls. The current approach of only considering two stalls is incorrect.
   - A correct solution would involve dynamically setting the prices for each stall to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. This can be achieved by setting the price of each stall such that Alice buys exactly one jewel at each stall until she reaches the required count `k`.

Given the above analysis, the current implementation is incorrect because it only considers splitting the coins into two stalls, which is not sufficient to handle all cases as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
