Output State: **The program returns None**

Explanation: The provided code snippet does not contain any return statement with a value. Therefore, the function would return `None` by default, as `return` without any value specified returns the `None` object in Python. Given the initial state information about `n` and `k`, the absence of a return statement means the function will simply return `None`.
