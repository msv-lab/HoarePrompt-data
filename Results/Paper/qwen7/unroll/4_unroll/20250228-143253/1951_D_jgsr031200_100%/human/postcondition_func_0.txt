The function accepts two parameters, n and k, both of which are positive integers with a constraint of 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. If n equals k, it prints "YES" followed by 1 twice and returns the value of n. If n is less than k, it prints "NO" and returns None. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in the list `costs` where `costs` is initialized as `[n - k + 1, 1]`. If this sum is less than k, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES", 2, and the elements of the list `costs`. The function returns None in all cases except when n equals k.
