#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, edges is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, and start is an integer representing the starting node for the game. Each node is uniquely identified by an integer from 1 to n. The tree has exactly two leaves, and the function assumes that the input guarantees this condition.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: `tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes, fully constructed based on the edges provided. The `n` variable remains an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, and the `start` variable retains its original integer value representing the starting node for the game.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns 'Ron'
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree), and `start` (an integer representing the starting node for the game). It constructs a tree representation using the provided edges, identifies the two leaves in the tree, calculates the shortest distances from the starting node to each leaf using BFS, and returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on whether these distances are even or odd. If at least one distance is even, the function returns 'Ron'; otherwise, it returns 'Hermione'.
