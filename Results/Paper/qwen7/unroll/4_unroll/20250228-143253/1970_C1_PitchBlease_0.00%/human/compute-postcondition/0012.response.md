The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree), and `start` (an integer representing the starting node for the game). Each node is uniquely identified by an integer from 1 to `n`. The tree has exactly two leaves, and the function assumes that the input guarantees this condition.

Based on the starting node and the structure of the tree, the function returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `edges`, and `start`. It returns 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on the starting node and the structure of the tree, which has exactly two leaves.**
