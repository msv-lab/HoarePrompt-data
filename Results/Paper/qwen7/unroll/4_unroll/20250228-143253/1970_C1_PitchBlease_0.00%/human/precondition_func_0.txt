n is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, edges is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, and start is an integer representing the starting node for the game. Each node is uniquely identified by an integer from 1 to n. The tree has exactly two leaves, and the function assumes that the input guarantees this condition.
