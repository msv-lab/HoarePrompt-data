Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring node indices, `visited` is a set containing `start`.**

The code initializes a set called `visited` and adds the starting node (`start`) to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
