Output State: **`leaves` is a list containing all nodes from `tree` that have exactly one adjacent node, `tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes, the `n` variable remains an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, the `start` variable retains its original integer value representing the starting node for the game, `dist1` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[0]` using BFS, `dist2` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[1]` using BFS.**

In this step, the code `dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])` calculates the shortest distance from the starting node (`start`) to the second leaf node (`leaves[1]`) using BFS. This distance is stored in the variable `dist2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
