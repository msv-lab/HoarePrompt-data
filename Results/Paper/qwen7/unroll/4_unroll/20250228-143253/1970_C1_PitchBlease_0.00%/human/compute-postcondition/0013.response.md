Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree), and `start` (an integer representing the starting node for the game). It constructs a tree representation using the provided edges, identifies the two leaves in the tree, calculates the shortest distances from the starting node to each leaf using BFS, and returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on whether these distances are even or odd. If at least one distance is even, the function returns 'Ron'; otherwise, it returns 'Hermione'.**
