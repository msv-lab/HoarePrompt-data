Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers n and k within each test case where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. It returns a result based on the relationship between n and k.**

This means the function indirectly accepts two integers `n` and `k` through a test case structure, where `n` and `k` must satisfy the conditions 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `t` (the number of test cases) must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. The function then determines and returns a result based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.
