Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). Additionally, the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. For each test case, the function performs some unspecified operation and returns the result.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases with specific constraints on the values of t and n, and it returns a result based on these test cases without needing any external parameters to be passed directly to the function.
