Output State: t test cases are printed, each followed by two lines of output. For each test case:
1. A line containing the value of `res` and `n << 1`.
2. `n` lines, each starting with '1' followed by numbers from 1 to n.
3. `n` lines, each starting with '2' followed by numbers from 1 to n.

The value of `res` is calculated as the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for each row `i` in the matrix `mat`, and `n << 1` is equivalent to `2 * n`. The matrix `mat` is a square matrix of size `n x n` filled with numbers from 1 to n in sequence.
