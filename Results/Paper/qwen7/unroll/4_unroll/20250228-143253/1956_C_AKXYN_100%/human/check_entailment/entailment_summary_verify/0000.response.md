Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \(n \times n\) matrix using at most \(2n\) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix. The key is to understand how to use these operations to maximize the sum.

### Program Analysis

The provided program does the following:
1. Reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Initializes an \(n \times n\) matrix `mat` with the identity permutation.
   - Calculates a value `res` using a formula that does not involve any actual operations.
   - Prints `res` and \(2n\).
   - Prints \(n\) lines starting with '1' followed by numbers from 1 to \(n\).
   - Prints another \(n\) lines starting with '2' followed by numbers from 1 to \(n\).

Here is the breakdown of the program's steps:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]  # Initialize matrix with identity permutation
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)  # Calculate a value res using a formula
        print(res, n << 1)  # Print res and 2n
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):  # Print n lines starting with '1' followed by numbers from 1 to n
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Print another n lines starting with '2' followed by numbers from 1 to n
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Correctness Evaluation

1. **Matrix Initialization**: The matrix is initialized with the identity permutation, which means each row and column is already in the correct order. This does not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The value `res` is calculated using the formula \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1)\). This formula does not reflect the actual operations needed to maximize the sum of the matrix.

3. **Operations**: The program prints \(n\) lines starting with '1' followed by numbers from 1 to \(n\) and another \(n\) lines starting with '2' followed by numbers from 1 to \(n\). These operations do not change the matrix in a way that maximizes its sum.

### Example Verification

Consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- For \(n = 2\):
  - Initial matrix: \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}\)
  - Sum: \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\)
  - Maximum possible sum: \(7\)

The program calculates \(res = 1 \times 3 + 2 \times 5 = 3 + 10 = 13\), which is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix. It initializes the matrix with the identity permutation and calculates a sum based on a formula that does not reflect the actual operations needed to achieve the maximum sum. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
