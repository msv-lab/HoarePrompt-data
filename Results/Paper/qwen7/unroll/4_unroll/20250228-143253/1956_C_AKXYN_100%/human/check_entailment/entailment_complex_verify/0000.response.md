### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Initialization and Matrix Setup**:
   - The program initializes an \( n \times n \) matrix `mat` with the identity permutation. This means each row \( i \) will have the values \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - This initialization step is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum \( res \) as the sum of \((i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)\) for each row \( i \). This sum is computed as:
     \[
     res = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1)
     \]
   - This calculation is mathematically correct and matches the formula provided in the problem statement.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated sum \( res \) and \( 2n \) (which is the maximum number of operations allowed).
   - It then prints \( n \) lines starting with '1' followed by numbers from 1 to \( n \), and another \( n \) lines starting with '2' followed by numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - These lines represent the operations performed, but they do not reflect the actual operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Actual Operations**:
   - The operations printed are simply setting each row and column to the identity permutation. This does not maximize the sum of the matrix.
   - The problem requires specific operations to maximize the sum, not just setting the matrix to the identity permutation.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix. The operations printed do not reflect the necessary steps to achieve the maximum sum as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix using the specified operations.
