### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - There are two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Permute the elements in a specific row.
     - Type 2: Permute the elements in a specific column.
   - The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function initializes the matrix `mat` with values from 1 to \( n \) in each row.
   - It calculates the expected maximum sum \( res \) as the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers.
   - It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required.
   - It performs \( n \) Type 1 operations followed by \( n \) Type 2 operations to ensure each element in the matrix is set to its correct value.

3. **Verification:**
   - The sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers is \( 1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2n-1) = n^2 \).
   - The function sets each element \( a_{i,j} \) to \( j \) for Type 1 operations and to \( i \) for Type 2 operations, which correctly fills the matrix with values from 1 to \( n \).
   - Each operation is performed exactly once, ensuring the matrix is fully populated without exceeding the limit of \( 2n \) operations.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the edge case where \( n = 1 \) correctly.
   - For larger \( n \), the solution ensures that each element is set to its correct value within the constraints.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the function does not actually maximize the sum of the matrix elements. Instead, it simply initializes the matrix with values from 1 to \( n \) in each row and column, which results in a sum of \( n^2 \). This is not necessarily the maximum possible sum under the given operations.

To maximize the sum, we need to strategically permute the rows and columns to achieve the highest possible sum. The current implementation does not consider the permutations that would yield the maximum sum.

### Example Analysis:

- For \( n = 2 \):
  - The initial matrix is:
    ```
    1 2
    1 2
    ```
  - The sum is \( 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6 \).
  - The correct maximum sum is \( 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 \), which can be achieved by permuting the columns.

- For \( n = 3 \):
  - The initial matrix is:
    ```
    1 2 3
    1 2 3
    1 2 3
    ```
  - The sum is \( 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 18 \).
  - The correct maximum sum is \( 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 18 \), which can be achieved by permuting the rows and columns.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix elements. It merely initializes the matrix with values from 1 to \( n \) in each row and column, which does not guarantee the maximum possible sum.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
