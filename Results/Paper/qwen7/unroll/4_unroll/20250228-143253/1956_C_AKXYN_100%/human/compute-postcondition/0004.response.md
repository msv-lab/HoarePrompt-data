Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 500 \)). For each test case, it calculates a value \( res \) as the sum of \((i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)\) for each row \( i \) in a square matrix of size \( n \times n \), and prints \( res \) along with \( 2n \). It then prints \( n \) lines starting with '1' followed by numbers from 1 to \( n \), and another \( n \) lines starting with '2' followed by numbers from 1 to \( n \).**
