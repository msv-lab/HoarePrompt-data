### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - There are two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Permute the elements in a specific row.
     - Type 2: Permute the elements in a specific column.
   - The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function initializes the matrix `mat` with values from 1 to \( n \) in each row.
   - It calculates the expected maximum sum \( res \) as the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers.
   - It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required.
   - It performs \( n \) Type 1 operations followed by \( n \) Type 2 operations to ensure each element in the matrix is set to its correct value.

3. **Verification:**
   - The sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers is \( 1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2n-1) = n^2 \).
   - However, the calculation of `res` in the code is incorrect. The code calculates `res` as the sum of \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) for each row `i`, which is not the correct formula for the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers. The correct formula is simply \( n^2 \).

4. **Correct Calculation:**
   - The correct way to calculate the maximum sum is to directly assign the matrix to be filled with numbers from 1 to \( n \) in each row and column, which inherently gives a sum of \( n^2 \).

5. **Matrix Initialization:**
   - The matrix `mat` is initialized correctly with values from 1 to \( n \) in each row, but the calculation of `res` is incorrect. Instead of calculating `res` as the sum of \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\), it should be directly set to \( n^2 \).

6. **Operations:**
   - The operations performed are correct. Performing \( n \) Type 1 operations followed by \( n \) Type 2 operations ensures that each element in the matrix is set to its correct value, achieving the maximum sum \( n^2 \).

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the edge case where \( n = 1 \) correctly.
   - For larger \( n \), the solution ensures that each element is set to its correct value within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is almost correct, but the calculation of `res` is incorrect. The correct approach is to directly set `res` to \( n^2 \). The rest of the logic is correct.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
