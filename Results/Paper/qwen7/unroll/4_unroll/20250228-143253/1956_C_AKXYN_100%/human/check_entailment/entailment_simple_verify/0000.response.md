### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step and compare it with the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Matrix Initialization:**
   - The program initializes the matrix `mat` with the identity permutation for each row. This means that for each row `i`, the values are `[i+1, i+2, ..., i+n]`.

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum `res` using the formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for each row `i`. This formula does not directly relate to the problem's requirement of maximizing the sum through operations.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated sum `res` and `2 * n` (which is `n << 1`).
   - It then prints `n` rows of Type 1 operations and `n` rows of Type 2 operations, each setting the entire row or column to the identity permutation.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- The matrix `mat` is initialized with the identity permutation for each row, which is not what the problem requires. The problem states that we need to perform operations to maximize the sum, not just set the matrix to a specific pattern.
- The sum `res` is calculated using a formula that does not reflect the operations needed to maximize the sum.
- The operations printed do not align with the problem's requirement of maximizing the sum. Instead, they set each row and column to the identity permutation, which is not optimal.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix using the allowed operations. The provided solution does not perform the necessary operations to achieve the maximum sum, and the sum calculated is not based on the operations performed.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
