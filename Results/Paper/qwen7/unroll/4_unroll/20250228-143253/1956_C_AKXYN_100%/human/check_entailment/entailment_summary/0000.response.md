Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
2. Each test case involves setting specific rows and columns to permutations of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
3. The provided program initializes an \( n \times n \) matrix `mat` with values from 1 to \( n \) for each row, which is a valid permutation for each row.
4. The sum \( res \) is calculated correctly as the sum of \((i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)\) for each row \( i \). This formula seems to be derived from the pattern of filling the matrix.
5. The program prints the calculated sum \( res \) and \( 2n \) as the number of operations, which matches the requirement.
6. It then prints \( n \) lines starting with '1' and the sequence from 1 to \( n \), and another \( n \) lines starting with '2' and the sequence from 1 to \( n \). These operations effectively fill the matrix with the desired permutations.

Given these points, the program appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
