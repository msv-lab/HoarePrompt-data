Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations, where each operation can either permute the rows or columns.
2. The provided solution initializes the matrix `mat` with values from 1 to \( n \) in sequence, which means each element \( a_{i,j} \) is set to \( j \). This is a valid initial state.
3. The sum \( res \) is calculated as the sum of \( (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) \) for each row \( i \). This formula is derived from the pattern of filling the matrix and the subsequent sum calculation.
4. The solution prints the calculated sum \( res \) and \( 2n \) as the number of operations.
5. For each row \( i \) from \( n \) down to 1, it performs two operations:
   - A type 1 operation that permutes the elements of the \( i \)-th row to the sequence from 1 to \( n \).
   - A type 2 operation that permutes the elements of the \( i \)-th column to the sequence from 1 to \( n \).

This approach ensures that each element \( a_{i,j} \) is eventually set to its maximum possible value (which is \( n \) for the last row and column operations, and decreases accordingly).

Given the problem constraints and the provided solution, the logic seems sound and adheres to the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
