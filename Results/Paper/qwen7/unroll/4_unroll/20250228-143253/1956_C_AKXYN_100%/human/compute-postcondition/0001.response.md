Output State: t test cases are printed, each followed by a space and n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. For each test case, two lines are printed:
1. A line containing the sum `res` which is calculated as the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, followed by a space and `n << 1` (which is equivalent to `2 * n`).
2. `n` lines, each starting with '1 ' followed by numbers from 1 to n, and then `n` lines, each starting with '2 ' followed by numbers from 1 to n.
