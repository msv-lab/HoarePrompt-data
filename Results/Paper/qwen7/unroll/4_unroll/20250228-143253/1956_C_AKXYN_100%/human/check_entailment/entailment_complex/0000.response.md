Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations, where each operation can either permute the rows or columns.
2. The annotated program correctly initializes a matrix `mat` of size \( n \times n \) with values from 1 to \( n \) in sequence.
3. The value of `res` is calculated as the sum of \((i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)\) for each row \( i \) in the matrix. This formula is derived from the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers multiplied by their respective indices plus one, which indeed gives the sum of the matrix when filled sequentially.
4. The program then prints the calculated `res` and \( 2n \) as the result for each test case.
5. It prints \( n \) lines starting with '1' followed by numbers from 1 to \( n \), and another \( n \) lines starting with '2' followed by numbers from 1 to \( n \). These operations effectively permute the rows and columns back to their original order, which does not change the sum of the matrix but fulfills the requirement of performing up to \( 2n \) operations.

Given that the logic and calculations in the program align with the problem requirements and constraints, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
