State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a list of n integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, input function is ready to read the values for the loop**.

Explanation:
- The loop is controlled by the `input()` function, which reads the number of test cases (`t`). Therefore, the variable `t` must be within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) for the loop to execute.
- Each test case requires reading an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. This means that the input function is expected to provide these values for each iteration of the loop.
- Since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to adjust the states of the variables inside the loop body. We only need to ensure that the conditions for the loop to start executing are met.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should include the condition that `t` is within the specified range and that the input function is ready to provide the necessary values for each test case.
