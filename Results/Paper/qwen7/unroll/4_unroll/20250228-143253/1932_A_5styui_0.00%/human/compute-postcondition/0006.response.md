Functionality: **The function processes input data for up to 1000 test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a string representing a row of cells. The string consists of '.', '@', and '*' characters, where '.' represents an empty cell, '@' represents a cell with a coin, and '*' represents a cell with thorns. The function counts the number of cells with coins ('@') in each row and prints the count. After processing each row, it resets the count to zero. The function does not return any value but prints the count of coins for each test case.**
