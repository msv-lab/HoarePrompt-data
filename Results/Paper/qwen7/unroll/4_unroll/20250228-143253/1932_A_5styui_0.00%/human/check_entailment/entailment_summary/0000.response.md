Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the maximum number of coins that can be collected starting from the leftmost cell.
- The provided code simply counts the number of cells containing coins ('@') without considering the movement rules (i.e., moving one or two cells at a time and avoiding thorns).
- The code breaks immediately when it encounters a cell with thorns ('*'), which is incorrect because it should continue checking further cells after a thorn if the next cell is within the bounds and not a thorn.
- The code does not account for the fact that you can skip over thorns and continue collecting coins if possible.

Given these observations, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
