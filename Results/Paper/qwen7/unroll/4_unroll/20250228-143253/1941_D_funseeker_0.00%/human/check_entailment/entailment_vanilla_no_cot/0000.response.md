Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input using custom functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`) which abstract the reading of a single line, an integer, and space-separated integers into a list, respectively.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws**: For each throw, it processes the distance `r` and the direction `c`:
   - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, it adds the clockwise position `(q + r) % n` to the set.
   - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, it adds the counterclockwise position `(q - r) % n` to the set.

4. **Handling Edge Case**: After processing all throws, it handles the edge case where the player index might wrap around to 0 by adding `n` if 0 is in the set.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the number of possible players and their indices in sorted order.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program accurately calculates the possible players who could have the ball after the specified throws. Therefore, the program is correct.
