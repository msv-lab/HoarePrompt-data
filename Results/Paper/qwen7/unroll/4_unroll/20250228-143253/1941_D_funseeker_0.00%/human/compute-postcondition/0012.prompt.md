You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), x is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and the function `func_1` returns a string containing the distance `r` and the direction `c` of each throw in the format "r c".
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: `ans` is a set containing all possible positions the ball can be at after `m` throws, considering the operations defined in the loop. The exact elements of the set depend on the values returned by `func_1()` during each iteration.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: Postcondition: `ans` is a set containing all possible positions the ball can be at after `m` throws. If position 0 is in `ans`, then it is removed and the new position `n` is added to `ans`. If position 0 is not in `ans`, then `ans` remains unchanged and includes the new position `n`.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where len(ans) is the length of the set ans before the conditional check)
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: {n} (where n is the new position and ans is the set of possible positions after m throws, with 0 removed and replaced by n if 0 was originally in ans)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a string containing the distance `r` and the direction `c` of each throw in the format "r c" for a given number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), number of throws (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), and the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
