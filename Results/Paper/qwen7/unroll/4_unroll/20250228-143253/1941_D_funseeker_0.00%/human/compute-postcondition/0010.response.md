Based on the initial state described, the `ans` set contains all possible positions the ball can be at after `m` throws. If position 0 is in `ans`, it is removed, and the new position `n` is added to `ans`. If position 0 is not in `ans`, `ans` remains unchanged and includes the new position `n`.

Since the exact values of `ans` and `n` are not provided, we need to consider both scenarios:

1. If `0` is in `ans`, then `0` is removed and `n` is added.
2. If `0` is not in `ans`, then `ans` remains unchanged and includes `n`.

In either case, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` set in an unspecified order.

Output: **{n} (where n is the new position and ans is the set of possible positions after m throws, with 0 removed and replaced by n if 0 was originally in ans)**
