### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the input using `func_1` and `func_2` to parse integers.
   - It uses `func_3` to read multiple space-separated integers from the input.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The initial position of the ball (`x`) is stored in the `ans` set, which is initialized to `{x}`.
   - This part is also correct and matches the problem description.

3. **Processing Each Throw**:
   - For each of the `m` throws, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, the ball can be thrown clockwise, so `(q + r) % n` is added to the set `temp`.
   - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, the ball can be thrown counterclockwise, so `(q - r) % n` is added to the set `temp`.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

4. **Updating the Set**:
   - The `ans` set is updated to `temp` after processing each throw.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

5. **Handling Edge Case**:
   - If the final position is `0`, it is adjusted to `n` by removing `0` and adding `n` to the set.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

6. **Output**:
   - The size of the `ans` set is printed, followed by the elements of the set in sorted order.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State**: `t` is read as the number of test cases.
- **Test Case Processing**:
  - For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `x` are read.
  - The initial position `x` is added to the set `ans`.
  - For each of the `m` throws, the distance `r` and direction `c` are read.
  - Depending on `c`, the possible new positions are added to `temp`.
  - After processing all throws, the final set `ans` is adjusted if necessary.
  - The size of `ans` and its elements are printed.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes each throw, updates the possible positions of the ball, and outputs the correct results.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
