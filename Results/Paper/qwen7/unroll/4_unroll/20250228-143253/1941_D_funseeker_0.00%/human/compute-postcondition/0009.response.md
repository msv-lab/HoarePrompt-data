Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is a set containing all possible positions the ball can be at after `m` throws.
- If position `0` is in `ans`, then it is removed and the new position `n` is added to `ans`.
- If position `0` is not in `ans`, then `ans` remains unchanged and includes the new position `n`.

The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the length of the set `ans`.

To determine the exact value printed, we need to consider two cases:

1. **If position `0` is in `ans`:**
   - Position `0` is removed from `ans`.
   - The new position `n` is added to `ans`.
   - The length of `ans` remains the same because one element is removed and another is added.

2. **If position `0` is not in `ans`:**
   - The new position `n` is added to `ans`.
   - The length of `ans` increases by 1.

In both cases, the length of `ans` does not change because the removal and addition of the same number of elements (either 0 or 1) occurs.

Therefore, the length of `ans` remains the same as it was before the conditional check.

Output: **len(ans) (where len(ans) is the length of the set ans before the conditional check)**
