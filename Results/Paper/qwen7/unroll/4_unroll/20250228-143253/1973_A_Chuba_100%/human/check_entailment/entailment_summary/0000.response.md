Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`.
3. The program checks if the sum of these three integers is odd. If it is, the function correctly prints `-1` because an odd sum cannot be achieved through the described scoring system (where the sum of points must always be even).
4. If the sum is even, the program uses the formula `(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2` to calculate the maximum possible number of draws. This formula is derived from the fact that each draw contributes 2 points in total (1 point to each player), while a win/loss scenario contributes 2 points to one player and 0 to the other. The term `max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)` ensures that we do not count impossible scenarios where the difference in points among the players would make it impossible to achieve the given scores through draws alone.
5. The division by 2 in the formula accounts for the fact that each draw adds 2 points in total to the sum of the players' scores.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to follow the logic correctly and should produce the expected output for the provided examples and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
