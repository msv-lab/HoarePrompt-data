Output State: **`t` is reduced to an input integer, and all other variables are not yet defined.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the input for `t` is specified to be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `t` is now set to this input value. However, the values of `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain undefined as they have not been assigned any values yet.
