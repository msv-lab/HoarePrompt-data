You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly maximizes the product of `x` and `y` by swapping their corresponding digits.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two strings `a` and `b` which represent the integers `x` and `y`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Two empty strings `kq1` and `kq2` are initialized to store the modified versions of `a` and `b`.
   - A variable `vt` is initialized to 0 to keep track of whether a swap has been performed.

3. **Swapping Digits:**
   - The program iterates through each character in the strings `a` and `b`.
   - If the characters at the current position are the same, they are added to `kq1` and `kq2` without modification.
   - If the characters are different, the smaller digit is added to `kq1` and the larger digit is added to `kq2`. This ensures that the higher digits are moved to the most significant positions, potentially maximizing the product.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all characters, the program prints the modified strings `kq1` and `kq2`.

### Issues with the Given Program:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Swapping:**
   - The logic for swapping digits is flawed. The program only swaps the first differing pair of digits and then continues without further consideration. This means that subsequent digits might not be optimally swapped to maximize the product.

2. **No Consideration for Multiple Digits:**
   - The program does not handle cases where multiple digits need to be swapped to achieve the maximum product. It only performs one swap per iteration.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The output format is correct, but the logic to maximize the product is incorrect.

### Example Analysis:

Consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- Test Case 1: `x = 73`, `y = 31`
  - The program would swap the second digits: `73 -> 71` and `31 -> 33`.
  - This is correct for this specific case.

- Test Case 2: `x = 2`, `y = 5`
  - The program would swap the digits: `2 -> 2` and `5 -> 5`.
  - This is also correct for this specific case.

- Test Case 3: `x = 3516`, `y = 3982`
  - The program would swap the digits: `3516 -> 3912` and `3982 -> 3586`.
  - This is incorrect because the optimal solution would be to swap the digits to maximize the product, which is not achieved by just swapping the first differing pair.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping their corresponding digits. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
