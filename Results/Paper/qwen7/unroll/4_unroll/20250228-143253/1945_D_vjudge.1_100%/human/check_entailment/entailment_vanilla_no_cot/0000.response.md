Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. **Data Preparation**: It constructs an array `c` where each element is the minimum cost to move past the corresponding person in the queue.
3. **Suffix Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the suffix sum array `suff`, which helps in efficiently calculating the total cost of moving past a certain number of people.
4. **Cost Calculation**: For each possible position `i` where Kirill could end up within the first `m` people, the program calculates the cost of moving past all people from the start to position `i` and updates the minimum cost accordingly.

The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem statement and constraints, making the program correct.
