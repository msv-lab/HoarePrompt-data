The function accepts four parameters: n (a positive integer), k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), a (a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and b (a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). It computes a list `c` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Then, it calculates a suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`. Finally, it finds and returns the minimum value among `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for `0 ≤ i < k`.
