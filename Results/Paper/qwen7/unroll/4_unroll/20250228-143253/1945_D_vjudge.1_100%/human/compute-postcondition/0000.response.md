Output State: **`c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `0 â‰¤ i < n`. `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `c` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of the corresponding elements `a[i]` and `b[i]` from the lists `a` and `b`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
