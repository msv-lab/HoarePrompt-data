Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `k`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0, as `range(k)` generates values from 0 to `k-1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be 0, and `k` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

4. **List of Objects to Adjust**: The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `k`.

5. **Adjust the States**: Based on the above points, we need to adjust the initial value of `i` to 0 and ensure that `k` is at least 1.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
