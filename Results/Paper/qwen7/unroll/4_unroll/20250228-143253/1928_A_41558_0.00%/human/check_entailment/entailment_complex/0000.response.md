Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.

2. **Conditions Check**:
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program prints 'NO'. This is correct because if both dimensions are odd, cutting the rectangle along either side will result in two smaller rectangles with odd dimensions, and no further transformation can produce a new distinct rectangle.
   - If `a / 2` equals `b` or `b / 2` equals `a`, the program also prints 'NO'. This condition ensures that the rectangle can't be split into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged into a new distinct rectangle. For example, a 4x2 rectangle can be split into two 2x2 squares, but there's no way to rearrange them into a new distinct rectangle.
   - In all other cases, the program prints 'YES'. This means that the rectangle can be split and rearranged into a new distinct rectangle.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where both dimensions are odd or one dimension is exactly double the other dimension, ensuring that no new distinct rectangle can be formed.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function is correct. Therefore, the program will produce the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
