Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum prefix length `k` of string `a` that forms a subsequence of string `b`. The function `func_1` efficiently finds the next occurrence of the current character of `a` in the remaining part of `b`, ensuring that the program works as intended for the given problem constraints.
