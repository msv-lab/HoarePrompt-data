Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: a (a binary string), b (another binary string), i (a non-negative integer representing the current index in string a), and j (a non-negative integer representing the current index in string b). It returns the value of j plus the index of the first occurrence of a[i] in the substring b[j:], or -1 if a[i] does not appear in b[j:].**
