Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum prefix length `k` such that the prefix of string `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of string `b`. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, which is supposed to find the next occurrence of the current character of `a` in the remaining part of `b`. However, the function only checks for the first occurrence of the character and does not account for the fact that the characters in `a` might appear multiple times and in different positions within `b`.

For example, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 8
  10011
  11100101
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  5
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

In this case, the program incorrectly finds the maximum prefix length as 2 instead of 5 because it stops at the first occurrence of '1' in `b` after finding the first '1' in `a`. It does not continue searching for subsequent characters in `a` within `b`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it continues searching for the next character in `a` within the remaining part of `b` after finding the first occurrence. This can be achieved by updating the `j` index appropriately after finding a match.
