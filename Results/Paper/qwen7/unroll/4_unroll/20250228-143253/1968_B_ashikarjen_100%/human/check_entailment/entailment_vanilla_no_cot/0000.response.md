Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is almost correct, but it has a small issue that might cause it to fail in some edge cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where `b[j]` is never equal to `a[i]` for any `i`. In such cases, the loop will exit prematurely without properly accounting for the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    # Ensure that we account for the longest prefix
    k = min(k, n)
    print(k)
    return
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- The addition of `k = min(k, n)` ensures that the value of `k` does not exceed the length of `a`, which is `n`. This handles cases where the entire string `a` needs to be checked against `b`, but `b` does not contain all characters of `a`.

This fix ensures that the program correctly computes the maximum length `k` such that the first `k` characters of `a` form a subsequence of `b`.
