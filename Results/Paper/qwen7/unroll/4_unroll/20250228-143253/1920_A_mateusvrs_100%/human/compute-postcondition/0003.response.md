Output State: `t` is the number of iterations in the outer loop, `r` is a list containing the results of each iteration where each result is calculated based on the conditions inside the nested loops. Each element in `r` is either 0 or the difference between `ax` and `bx` minus the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
