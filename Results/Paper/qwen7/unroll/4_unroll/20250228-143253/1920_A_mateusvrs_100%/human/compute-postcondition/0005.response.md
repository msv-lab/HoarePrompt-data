To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer input value.
   - `r` is a list containing integers calculated based on the conditions inside the loop for each input value of `t`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*r, sep='\n')
   ```

Given this, the `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement will print each element of the list `r` on a new line due to the `sep='\n'` parameter.

However, since the specific values of `r` are not explicitly provided, we need to describe the elements of `r` based on the conditions inside the loop, which are not detailed in the initial state.

Therefore, the output will be the elements of the list `r`, each on a new line. Since the exact values of `r` are not specified, we can only describe them in terms of their generation process.

Output: **the elements of the list r, each on a new line**
