Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Base Case Handling:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program prints `a` directly. This is correct because buying one yogurt at the regular price is the only option.

3. **Promotion Calculation:**
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1`: The cost if each yogurt is bought individually at the regular price `a`. This is simply `a * n`.
     - `ans2`: The cost if pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotion price `b`. This is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`. Here, `n // 2` gives the number of complete pairs, and `n % 2` gives the remaining yogurts that need to be bought individually.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two values.

### Verification:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - When `n` is even, `n % 2` will be 0, so `ans2` will be `b * (n // 2)`, which is equivalent to buying all yogurts in pairs.
  - When `n` is odd, `n % 2` will be 1, so `ans2` will be `b * (n // 2) + a`, which means buying `(n // 2)` pairs and one additional yogurt at the regular price.

- **Comparison Logic:**
  - The logic for calculating `ans1` and `ans2` is correct.
  - The comparison between `ans1` and `ans2` to find the minimum cost is also correct.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `2 5 9`
  - Output: `9`
  - Explanation: Buying 2 yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper (`9 < 10`).

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `3 5 9`
  - Output: `14`
  - Explanation: Buying 2 yogurts at the promotion price and 1 at the regular price is cheaper (`9 + 5 = 14 < 15`).

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `3 5 11`
  - Output: `15`
  - Explanation: Buying 2 yogurts at the promotion price and 1 at the regular price is cheaper (`11 + 4 = 15 < 15`).

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `4 5 11`
  - Output: `20`
  - Explanation: Buying 2 yogurts at the promotion price for each pair is cheaper (`11 * 2 = 22 > 20`).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all edge cases and follows the logic to minimize the cost of buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
