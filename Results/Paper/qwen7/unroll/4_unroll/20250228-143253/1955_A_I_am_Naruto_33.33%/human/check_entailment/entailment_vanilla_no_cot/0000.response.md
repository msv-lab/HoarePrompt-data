Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each test case, it calculates the cost if all yogurts were bought at the regular price (`ans1 = a * n`).
   - It also calculates the cost if the yogurts were bought optimally using the promotion (`ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`). This ensures that pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotional price, and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price.
3. **Output**: The function prints the minimum of the two calculated costs.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the function accurately determines the minimum cost for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
