The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, a, and b. For each test case, if n is greater than 1, it calculates the minimum value between \(a \times n\) and \(b \times n // 2 + a \times n \% 2\), then prints this minimum value. If n is 1, it simply prints the value of a. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
