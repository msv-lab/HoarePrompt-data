### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem statement and the provided annotations.

1. **Problem Statement Recap**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix \( \sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} \).
   - Operations can be of two types:
     - Type 1: Permute the elements of a chosen row.
     - Type 2: Permute the elements of a chosen column.
   - The solution should use no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the matrix size \( n \).
   - It then prints the maximum possible sum and the number of operations required.
   - It performs \( 2n \) operations, each setting the entire row or column to a permutation of numbers from \( n \) down to 1.

3. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The function `func_1()` correctly processes each test case.
   - It prints the maximum sum as \( \frac{n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4 \cdot n - 1)}{6} \), which is incorrect.
   - It prints \( 2n \) operations, each setting the entire row or column to a descending sequence.

4. **Correct Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The correct formula for the maximum sum when filling the matrix with values \( n+1-i-j \) is \( \frac{n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (n + 1)}{2} \).
   - The program uses the incorrect formula, which means the calculated sum is not the maximum possible sum.

5. **Operations Analysis**:
   - While the program prints \( 2n \) operations, these operations do not necessarily achieve the maximum sum. The intended operations should involve permuting the rows and columns to maximize the sum, not just setting each row or column to a descending sequence.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly solve the problem because it uses an incorrect formula to calculate the maximum sum and the operations performed do not maximize the sum.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula to calculate the maximum sum and the operations performed do not achieve the maximum sum.
