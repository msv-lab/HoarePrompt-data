Reasoning:
1. The program reads input data and processes multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the array itself.
3. It then calculates the prefix XOR values for the array and stores them in the `pf` list.
4. For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray from index `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR values.
5. If the XOR value is zero, it directly appends 'YES' to the results.
6. Otherwise, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find potential split points and checks if a valid split can be made.
7. The logic for checking the split points seems correct, as it ensures that the subarray can be divided into two parts with the same XOR value.
8. The program handles all the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
