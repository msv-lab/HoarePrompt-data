Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: From the given state, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[0])`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`. If `t` is 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be at least 1**
