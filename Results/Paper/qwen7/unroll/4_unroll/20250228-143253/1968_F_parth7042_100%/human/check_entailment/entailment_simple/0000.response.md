### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It initializes variables such as `t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, and `mp` correctly.
   - `a` is initialized with an extra element to handle indexing properly.
   - `pf` is initialized to store prefix XOR values.
   - `mp` is a dictionary that maps prefix XOR values to their corresponding indices.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it processes `n` and `q`.
   - It initializes `a` and `pf` arrays.
   - It populates `mp` with prefix XOR values and their indices.
   - For each query, it calculates the XOR value of the subarray using the prefix XOR values.
   - If the XOR value is zero, it directly appends 'YES' to the results.
   - Otherwise, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find potential split points and checks if they satisfy the conditions for being an interesting subarray.

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the results for each query in the required format.

Given the above analysis, the program logic appears to be correct and matches the problem description. The steps for processing each query and determining if a subarray is interesting are implemented accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
