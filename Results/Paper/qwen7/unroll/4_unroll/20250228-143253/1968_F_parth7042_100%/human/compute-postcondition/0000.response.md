Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, n and q are not yet defined, a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, each query is a pair of integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.**

The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns it to the variable `data`. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, and the queries are not yet defined and remain as part of the initial state.
