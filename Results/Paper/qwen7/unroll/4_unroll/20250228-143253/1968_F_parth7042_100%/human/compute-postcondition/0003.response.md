Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[0])`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, n and q are not yet defined, a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, each query is a pair of integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.**

The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `t`, `data`, `n`, `q`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.
