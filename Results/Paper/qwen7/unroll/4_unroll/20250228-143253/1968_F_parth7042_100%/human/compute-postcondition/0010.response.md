Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an array of integers `a` and a set of queries. For each query, it checks if there exists a subarray within the specified range `[l, r]` whose bitwise XOR is zero. If such a subarray is found, it appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. The function then prints the results for all queries.**
