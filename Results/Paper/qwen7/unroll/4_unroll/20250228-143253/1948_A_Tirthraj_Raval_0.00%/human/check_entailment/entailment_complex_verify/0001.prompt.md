You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
        
    #State: For each input integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) within the range specified by `t`, if `n` is odd, the output will be 'NO'. If `n` is even, the output will be 'YES' followed by a pattern consisting of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, with the length of the pattern being `n/2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases (up to 50) where for each case, it reads an integer \( n \) (between 1 and 50). If \( n \) is odd, it outputs 'NO'. If \( n \) is even, it outputs 'YES' followed by a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, with the length of the string being \( n/2 \). After processing all test cases, no variables are returned, but the console will display the appropriate output for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the number of special characters required in the string.

2. **Checking for Validity:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd.
     - If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters where each special character has exactly one neighbor different from itself.
     - If `n` is even, it proceeds to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters.

3. **Constructing the String:**
   - The program constructs a string using a repeating pattern "AB".
   - It appends alternating 'A' and 'B' characters to form a pattern.
   - Since the length of the pattern is `n // 2 * 2`, the resulting string will have exactly `n` special characters.

4. **Special Characters Count:**
   - In the constructed string, every character except the first and last will be a special character because each of these characters (except the first and last) will have exactly one neighbor different from itself.
   - This ensures that the number of special characters is `n`.

### Example Verification

- For `n = 6`:
  - The pattern "ABABAB" is constructed.
  - The special characters are at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5.
  - Total special characters: 4 (not 6), so this approach fails for `n = 6`.

- For `n = 4`:
  - The pattern "ABAB" is constructed.
  - The special characters are at positions 2 and 3.
  - Total special characters: 2 (not 4), so this approach fails for `n = 4`.

- For `n = 2`:
  - The pattern "AB" is constructed.
  - The special characters are at positions 2.
  - Total special characters: 1 (not 2), so this approach fails for `n = 2`.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle the construction of the string when `n` is even. It constructs a pattern that results in fewer than `n` special characters. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
