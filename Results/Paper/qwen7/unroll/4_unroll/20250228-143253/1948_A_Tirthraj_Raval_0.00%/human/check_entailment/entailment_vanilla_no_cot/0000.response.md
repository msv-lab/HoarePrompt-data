Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a string with exactly `n` special characters as defined in the problem statement. The pattern it generates (`ABAB...`) does not ensure that each character is special according to the problem's definition. For instance, with `n=6`, the generated string `ABABAB` has only 2 special characters instead of 6. The program needs to generate a string where each character is special, meaning each character must differ from exactly one of its neighbors. A correct approach would involve creating a repeating pattern like `AABBAABB...` to ensure that each character is special.
