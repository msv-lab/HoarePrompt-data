Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `total` is 45, `numbers` is a list of `t` integers (unchanged), `values` is a list of 10 integers `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 45]`, `sum_values` is a list of 11 integers `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 90]`.

Explanation: The loop iterates from 10 to `n` (assuming `n` is at least 10 for the loop to run). For each iteration, it calculates `values[i]` based on the last digit and the remaining part of the number, then updates `sum_values[i]` by adding `values[i]` to the previous sum up to `i-1`. Given the initial conditions, the loop will extend the lists `values` and `sum_values` to include the new calculated values for indices 10 to `n`. Since no specific `n` was provided beyond 10, we assume the loop runs until `n` is just above 10, thus extending the lists to index 10. The final value in `values` is 45, and the final value in `sum_values` is the sum of all previous values plus 45, which is 90.
Code of the loop:
for n in numbers:
    print(sum_values[n])


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
