Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, `l` is 0, and `r` is n - 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `l` and `r`. `l` is assigned the value 0, and `r` is assigned the value `n - 1`. The list `array` remains unchanged, and its length `n` also remains the same.
