You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a positive integer `t` (1 to 100) and an integer `n` (3 to 78). For each test case, it generates a string `word` based on the value of `n` and prints it. If `n` is greater than 52, `word` consists of the character corresponding to `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 28 and 52, `word` starts with 'a', followed by the character corresponding to `n - 28`, and ends with 'z'. If `n` is exactly 27, `word` is set to 'aay'. Otherwise, `word` is 'aa' followed by the character corresponding to `n - 3'. After processing all test cases, the function prints each generated `word`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain encoded values. For example, consider the encoded value `24`. According to the problem description, the lexicographically smallest word that encodes to `24` is `"aav"`, but the program incorrectly outputs `"aaz"`.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

- For `n = 24`, the correct output should be `"aav"`.
- The program generates `"aaz"` instead.

The program logic needs to ensure that it always generates the lexicographically smallest word. A corrected approach would involve constructing the word character by character while ensuring the smallest possible letters are used. Here’s a revised version of the function that should work correctly:

```python
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        for i in range(3):
            if n >= 27:
                word += alphabet[0]
                n -= 27
            else:
                word += alphabet[n - 1]
                n = 0
        print(word)

func()
```

This revised function ensures that the word is constructed lexicographically by always choosing the smallest possible letter at each step.
