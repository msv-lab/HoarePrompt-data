You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Annotated Code: 
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78 after the loop has executed all its iterations. The value of `word` is determined based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration of `i`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It then reads the encoded value `n` for each test case.

2. **Encoding Logic**:
   - The program aims to decode the integer `n` back into a three-letter word.
   - The logic is divided into different cases based on the value of `n`.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: `n > 52`
     - Here, the word is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
     - This handles words like "rzz" (where `n = 70`).
   - **Case 2**: `n > 27`
     - Here, the word is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
     - This handles words like "czz" (where `n = 55`).
   - **Case 3**: `n == 27`
     - Here, the word is explicitly set to `'aay'`.
   - **Case 4**: `n <= 26`
     - Here, the word is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
     - This handles words like "aaa" (where `n = 3`).

4. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The program ensures that the word is lexicographically smallest by constructing it in the order specified above.
   - For values of `n` between 27 and 52, the constructed word is indeed the lexicographically smallest possible word.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n == 27` by setting the word to `'aay'`.
   - For other values, the construction logic ensures the smallest possible word.

### Verification with Provided Examples

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

- **Input**: `24`
  - `24 - 53 = -29` (not applicable)
  - `24 - 28 = -4` (not applicable)
  - `24 - 3 = 21` -> `'aa' + 'v'` -> `'aav'`
  - Output: `aav` (correct)

- **Input**: `70`
  - `70 - 53 = 17` -> `'r' + 'zz'` -> `'rzz'`
  - Output: `rzz` (correct)

- **Input**: `3`
  - `3 - 3 = 0` -> `'aa' + 'a'` -> `'aaa'`
  - Output: `aaa` (correct)

- **Input**: `55`
  - `55 - 28 = 27` -> `'a' + 'z' + 'z'` -> `'czz'`
  - Output: `czz` (correct)

- **Input**: `48`
  - `48 - 53 = -5` (not applicable)
  - `48 - 28 = 20` -> `'a' + 'u' + 'z'` -> `'auz'`
  - Output: `auz` (correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly decodes the integer `n` into the lexicographically smallest three-letter word according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
