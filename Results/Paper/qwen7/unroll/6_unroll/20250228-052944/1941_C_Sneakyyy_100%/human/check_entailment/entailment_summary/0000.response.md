Reasoning:
- The provided program aims to count the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful by removing all occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie'.
- However, the current implementation only counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' and 'pie', which is not the same as the minimum number of deletions needed.
- For instance, in the string "mmapnapie", the program would count two occurrences of 'map' and 'pie', but to make the string beautiful, we only need to delete 2 characters ('m' and 'a' at the start of 'mmap').
- The current logic does not handle overlapping substrings correctly and does not account for the minimum deletions required.

Correctness: **False**
