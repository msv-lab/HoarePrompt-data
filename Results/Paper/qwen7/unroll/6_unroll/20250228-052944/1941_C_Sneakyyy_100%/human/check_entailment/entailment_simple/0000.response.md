Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `a`.
3. It initializes `ans` to 0, which will count the number of deletions needed.
4. It uses a while loop to iterate through the string `a` up to the third last character (`len(a) - 2`), checking for the substrings "map" and "pie".
5. When it finds either "map" or "pie", it increments `i` by 3 and `ans` by 1, effectively skipping those three characters and counting them as deletions.
6. If no match is found, it simply increments `i` by 1.
7. After the loop, it prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotated program, the logic implemented in the function matches the requirements. The program correctly identifies and counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" and calculates the minimum deletions needed to remove these substrings.

Correctness: **True**
