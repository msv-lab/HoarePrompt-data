Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the removal of the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. The logic in the `while` loop only increments the index `i` by 3 when it encounters "map" or "pie", which means it skips over these substrings entirely without considering other possible characters that could form "map" or "pie" with subsequent characters.

To fix this, we need to check for the substrings "map" and "pie" more thoroughly and remove the necessary characters to break these substrings. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        
        i = 0
        while i < len(a):
            if i < len(a) - 2 and a[i:i+3] == 'pie':
                ans += 1  # Remove the 'pie' substring
                i += 3
            elif i < len(a) - 2 and a[i:i+3] == 'map':
                ans += 1  # Remove the 'map' substring
                i += 3
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that the minimum number of characters are removed to break any occurrence of "map" or "pie".
