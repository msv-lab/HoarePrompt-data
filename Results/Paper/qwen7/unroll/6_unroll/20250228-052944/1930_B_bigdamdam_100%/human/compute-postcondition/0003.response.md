Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each test case, the function determines whether the conditions for t and n are met and processes them accordingly, returning appropriate outputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for `t` and `n`, and validate these values against specified constraints, returning results based on those validations.
