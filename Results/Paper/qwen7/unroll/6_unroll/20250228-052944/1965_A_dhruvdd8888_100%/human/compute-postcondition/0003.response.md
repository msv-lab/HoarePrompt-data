Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and '0' is added to the set `nums`.**

Explanation: The code `nums = sorted(map(int, nums))` converts each element in the set `nums` to an integer using `map(int, nums)` and then sorts these integers in ascending order, storing the result back in `nums`. Since '0' was already added to the set `nums`, it remains in the list after sorting. All other variables (`t` and `N`) remain unchanged.
