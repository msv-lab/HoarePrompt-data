Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1()` without processing the input data. It should process each test case individually within the loop.

2. **Incorrect Use of `set` and `sorted`**: 
   - Using `set` on the input string directly is incorrect because `set` will not preserve the order of elements, and it will also remove duplicates, which is not necessary here.
   - The conversion of the input string to integers and sorting should be done correctly.

3. **Logic Error in Game State Calculation**:
   - The logic used to determine the winner is flawed. The game state should be determined based on the XOR of the sizes of the piles after each move, not by a simple loop through the sorted list.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

for _ in range(int(input())):
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate the XOR of all pile sizes
    xor_value = 0
    for num in nums:
        xor_value ^= num
    
    if xor_value > 0:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        print('Bob')
```

This corrected version processes each test case correctly, calculates the XOR of the pile sizes, and determines the winner based on the result of the XOR operation.
