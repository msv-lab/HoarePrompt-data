Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers within specified constraints for each test case. For each test case, it checks the list and returns information based on the occurrences of integers within the list.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes multiple test cases, each containing a list of integers. The list contains integers ranging from 1 to n, where n can go up to 2 * 10^5, and each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice. The function does not explicitly take parameters but operates on a list provided as part of the test case. It returns information about the list based on the occurrences of integers within the list.
