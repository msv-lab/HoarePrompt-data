Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the function `func()` is incorrect for calculating the maximum number of points you can get. Here’s why:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads input from standard input but does not correctly parse the input data. It assumes that the input is space-separated values and tries to calculate something related to the length of tokens and unique tokens, which is not relevant to the problem.

2. **Logic Mismatch**: The logic inside the function does not match the requirements of the problem. Specifically, it does not simulate the game or account for Nene's optimal strategy to minimize your score.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game and consider Nene's optimal moves. Here’s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def max_points(n, cards):
    # Count occurrences of each card
    card_count = {}
    for card in cards:
        if card in card_count:
            card_count[card] += 1
        else:
            card_count[card] = 1
    
    # Determine the maximum points you can get
    points = 0
    for card in cards:
        if card_count[card] == 2:
            points += 1
            card_count[card] -= 2
        elif card_count[card] == 1:
            card_count[card] -= 1
    
    return points

def func():
    import sys
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max_points(n, cards))

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program:
1. Reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cards and the cards in your hand.
3. Simulates the game by counting the occurrences of each card and determining the maximum points you can get by considering Nene's optimal strategy.

This approach ensures that the program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get based on the given problem description.
