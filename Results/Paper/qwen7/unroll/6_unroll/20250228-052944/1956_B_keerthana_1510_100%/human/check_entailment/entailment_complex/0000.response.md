Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the number of duplicate tokens in each line of input using the formula `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})`. However, this calculation does not reflect the actual logic needed to determine the maximum number of points you can get. The goal is to simulate the game and determine the best strategy for maximizing your points, not to count duplicates.

2. **Misunderstanding the Problem**: The program seems to be trying to process the input and calculate something related to duplicates, but it does not address the strategic aspect of the game where Nene always plays optimally to minimize your score.

3. **Output Mismatch**: The expected output is the maximum number of points you can get, but the program prints the number of duplicates in each line, which is irrelevant to the problem's requirements.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
