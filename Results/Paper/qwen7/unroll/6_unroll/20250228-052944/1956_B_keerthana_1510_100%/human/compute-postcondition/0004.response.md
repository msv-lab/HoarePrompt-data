Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing a list of integers. It skips the first two lines of input and then for every subsequent even-indexed line, it calculates the number of duplicate integers by comparing the count of unique integers with the total count of integers in that line. The result for each line is printed but not stored elsewhere. The final state of the program retains the original lists of integers without any changes.**
