### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where each move is mirrored by the computer.
   - The moves ensure no two rooks attack each other (same row or column).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), and the coordinates of the moves.
   - It then calculates the remaining size of the board \( n \) after accounting for the moves.
   - Finally, it calls a function `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations.

3. **Function `func_1(n)` Analysis**:
   - The function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on an \( n \times n \) board without attacking each other.
   - The recurrence relation used is:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - The base cases are \( dp[0] = 1 \) and \( dp[1] = 1 \).
   - The function correctly updates the `dp` array and returns the last element, which represents the number of configurations.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the main part of the program correctly reduces the board size \( n \) by the number of moves made.
   - The function `func_1(n)` correctly computes the number of configurations using the given recurrence relation.
   - The modulo operation ensures the result fits within the required bounds.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
