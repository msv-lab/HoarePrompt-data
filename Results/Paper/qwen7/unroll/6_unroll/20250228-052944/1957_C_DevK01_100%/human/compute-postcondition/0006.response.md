Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5. It initializes a list `dp` with the first two elements as 1. Then, it iterates from 2 to `n`, calculating each subsequent element of `dp` using the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9)`, where `i` is the current iteration index. After each calculation, the first element of `dp` is removed. Finally, the function returns the last element of the updated list `dp`.**
