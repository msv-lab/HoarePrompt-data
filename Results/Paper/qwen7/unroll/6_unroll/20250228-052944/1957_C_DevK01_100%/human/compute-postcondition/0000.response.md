Output State: **`dp` is a list containing [1, 1]**.

Explanation: The code initializes the list `dp` with the values `[1, 1]`. No other variables are affected, so the only change is in the `dp` list. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `k`, and the coordinates `(r_i, c_i)` remain unchanged as they are not used or modified in the given code snippet.
