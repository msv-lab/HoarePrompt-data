Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins across different outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This involves finding a set of bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) where \(x_i \leq 10^9\) and ensuring that for each \(i\), \(k_i \cdot x_i < \text{sum}(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the product of all multipliers \(m = k_1 \times k_2 \times \ldots \times k_n\).
   - It then computes a list of values \(c\) where each \(c[i] = \frac{m}{k[i]}\).
   - The function `func_1` is used to find the GCD of the list \(c\). This GCD is used to scale down the values in \(c\) to ensure they are within the allowed range.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the scaled-down values is less than or equal to \(\frac{m}{\text{GCD}}\). If so, it prints the scaled-down values; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Execution Summary Analysis**:
   - The execution summary correctly describes the functionality of the `func_1` function, which computes the GCD of a list of numbers.
   - The main logic of the program seems to follow the problem requirements: it calculates the necessary values and checks if they meet the condition.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The approach of calculating the product \(m\) and then dividing by each \(k_i\) to get \(c[i]\) is correct.
   - Using the GCD to scale down the values ensures that the resulting values are the smallest possible while still meeting the condition.
   - The check at the end to ensure the sum of the scaled-down values is less than \(\frac{m}{\text{GCD}}\) is correct and ensures the program meets the problem's requirements.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
