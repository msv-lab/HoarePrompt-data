Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to distribute coins among \(n\) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome. This means we need to find a distribution \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i\) for each \(i\).

2. **Key Insight**: To ensure the total bet is less than the winnings for each outcome, the total bet should be less than the minimum winnings divided by the number of outcomes. Specifically, if the GCD of the multipliers \(k_i\) is \(hcf\), then distributing \(c_i = \frac{m}{k_i}\) coins (where \(m = k_1 \cdot k_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot k_n\)) will satisfy the condition since \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i < m / hcf\).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly calculates the product \(m\) of all multipliers.
   - It then computes \(c_i = \frac{m}{k_i}\) for each \(i\).
   - The GCD of all \(c_i\) is calculated using the `func_1` function.
   - After normalizing \(c_i\) by dividing by the GCD, it checks if the sum of the normalized \(c_i\) is less than \(m / hcf\). If so, it prints the normalized values; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic of calculating \(m\) and \(c_i\) is correct.
   - The use of GCD to normalize the values ensures that the sum of the bets is minimized while still being less than the minimum winnings.
   - The check at the end ensures that the solution meets the problem's requirement.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
