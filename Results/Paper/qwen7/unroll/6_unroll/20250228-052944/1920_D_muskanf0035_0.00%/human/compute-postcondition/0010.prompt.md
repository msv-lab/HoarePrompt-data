You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value), and queries is a list of positive integers representing the queries. op_type is either 1 or 2, where 1 indicates appending an integer to the array and 2 indicates appending the current array x times to itself. value is an integer when op_type is 1, and an integer indicating how many times to append the array when op_type is 2. The length of operations is equal to n, and the size of queries is equal to q.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: Output State: `array` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list.
    #
    #Explanation: The given loop does not modify the `result` list at all. The only operation performed on the `array` is either appending a single element or extending the array with its own elements, which results in the `array` being identical to its initial state (an empty list) after the loop completes.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: Output State: `array` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list.
    return result
    #The program returns an empty list named result
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer), operations (a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers - op_type and value), and queries (a list of positive integers). It performs a series of operations based on the tuples in the operations list and appends results to an array according to the op_type and value provided. After all operations are performed, it returns an empty list named result.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns an empty list named result


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
