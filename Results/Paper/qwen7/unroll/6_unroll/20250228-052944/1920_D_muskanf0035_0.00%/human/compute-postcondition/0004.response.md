Functionality: **The function processes a series of operations and queries over multiple iterations. For each iteration, it reads values for n and q, a list of operations, and a list of queries. It then calls another function `func_1` to handle these inputs and prints the results. The final state consists of t lines, each containing the answers to the queries for that iteration, printed as space-separated integers.**
