The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer), operations (a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers - op_type and value), and queries (a list of positive integers). Based on the op_type and value in the operations list, it either appends a single integer to an initially empty array or extends the array by repeating its contents. After processing all operations, it creates a result list by appending elements from the array based on the indices specified in the queries list, modulo the length of the array. Finally, it returns an empty list named result.
