Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process a list of operations and generate the resulting array based on those operations.
   - However, the implementation of `func_1` is incorrect because it does not properly simulate the operations described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not handle the second type of operation correctly, which involves appending the entire array `x` times to itself.
   - Instead of extending the array with its own contents, the function simply appends the same elements repeatedly without actually modifying the array structure to reflect the operations.
   - The function then incorrectly computes the result by taking the modulo of the query index with the length of the array, which does not accurately represent the final array structure after all operations.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the inputs and calls `func_1` to process the data.
   - While `func_2` correctly handles reading the inputs and calling `func_1`, the issue lies with the implementation of `func_1`.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` is fundamentally flawed and does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
