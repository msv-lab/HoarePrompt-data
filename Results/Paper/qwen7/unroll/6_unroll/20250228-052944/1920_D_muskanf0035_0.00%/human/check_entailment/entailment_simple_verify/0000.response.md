### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The function starts with an empty array `array` and an empty result list `result`.
2. **Loop through Operations**:
   - If `op_type` is 1, the function appends `value` to `array`.
   - If `op_type` is 2, the function incorrectly extends `array` with its own elements using `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])`. This is incorrect because it does not append `x` copies of the current array but instead creates a new list with repeated elements of the current array.
3. **Query Handling**: For each query `k`, the function appends `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` to the result list. Since `array` is not correctly updated, this step also produces incorrect results.

#### Corrected Function `func_1`:
The original assessment suggests the following correction:
```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend(array * value)
    result = []
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result
```
- **Correct Operation Handling**: The corrected function correctly handles the second type of operation by extending `array` with `x` copies of the current array using `array.extend(array * value)`.
- **Query Handling**: The query handling remains the same and is now applied to the correctly updated `array`.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
The annotated code provides a detailed explanation of the states at key points in the function. However, the explanation is misleading because it incorrectly states that the `array` remains empty after the loop, which is not true. The `array` is correctly updated with the operations.

#### Correctness of the Program:
Given the corrected function `func_1`, the program should now correctly simulate the operations and handle the queries as required by the problem statement. The annotated code confirms that the `array` is updated correctly, and the queries are handled appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the original assessment was accurate. The initial implementation was incorrect, but the provided corrected version fixes the issue.

**Final: True**
