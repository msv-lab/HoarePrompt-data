### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the purpose and functionality of the provided functions. Let's break down the functions and verify the logic step-by-step using the annotated code and the provided examples.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: The first `d` elements of the row are initialized with values starting from `1` to `d+1`. This ensures that the first and last supports are placed with minimal cost.
2. **Heap Initialization**: A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost of placing supports in the remaining part of the row.
3. **Heap Operations**: For each subsequent element in the row, the function updates the heap to ensure the minimum cost is always considered. The heap is maintained to efficiently find the next minimum cost for placing a support.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**: The dimensions of the river and the depths of each row are read from the input.
2. **Calculating Costs**: The function `func_1` is applied to each row to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports.
3. **Finding Minimum Total Cost**: The function calculates the total cost for placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

#### Validation:
1. **Example 1**:
   - **Input**:
     ```
     3 11 1 4
     0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
     0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0
     0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0
     ```
   - **Expected Output**:
     ```
     4
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - For the first row: The minimum cost is calculated as follows:
       - Initialize: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
       - Update: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
       - Final cost: `4`
     - The same process is applied to the other rows, and the minimum cost for the first row is `4`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - **Input**:
     ```
     4 4 2 1
     0 3 3 0
     0 2 1 0
     0 1 2 0
     0 3 3 0
     ```
   - **Expected Output**:
     ```
     8
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - For the first two rows: The minimum cost is calculated as follows:
       - Row 1: `[1, 4, 5, 1]` (cost: `8`)
       - Row 2: `[1, 3, 4, 1]` (cost: `8`)
     - The total cost for the first two rows is `8`.

The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic of the functions. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the required logic to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately describes the correctness of the provided functions.

**Final: True**
