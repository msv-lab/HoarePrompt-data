To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `total_costs` is a list of sums. Each sum is calculated by taking consecutive sublists of length `k` from the `costs` list and then summing the elements within those sublists.
   - The length of `total_costs` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(min(total_costs))
   ```

Given this information, the `min(total_costs)` function will find the smallest value in the `total_costs` list. Since the exact values of `costs` and `k` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of the minimum sum. However, we know that `total_costs` contains sums of sublists of `costs`.

Therefore, the output will be the smallest sum among all the sums in `total_costs`.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of consecutive sublists of length k from the costs list)**
