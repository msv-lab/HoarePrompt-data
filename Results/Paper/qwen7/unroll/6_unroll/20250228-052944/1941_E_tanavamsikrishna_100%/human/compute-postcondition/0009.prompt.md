You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m, k, d) are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ d ≤ m; rows is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, and costs is a list of n integers where each element is calculated by the function func_1(row, d) for the corresponding row in rows.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: Output State: `total_costs` is a list of sums, where each sum is calculated by taking consecutive sublists of length `k` from the `costs` list and then summing the elements within those sublists. The length of `total_costs` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of consecutive sublists of length k from the costs list)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: n, m, k, and d, all of which are integers with specific constraints. It also accepts two additional parameters: rows, a list of n lists where each inner list contains m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, and costs, a list of n integers where each element is calculated by the function func_1(row, d) for the corresponding row in rows. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the input data according to the given constraints and calculations.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
