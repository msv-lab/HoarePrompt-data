Output State: **`n` is the number of rows, `m` and `k` retain their original values, `d` retains its original value, `rows` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers corresponding to the input split by spaces for each row, and `costs` is a list of integers where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list called `costs` by applying the function `func_1(row, d)` to each row in the `rows` list. The function `func_1` is applied to each row with the parameter `d`, and the results are stored in the `costs` list. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, and `rows`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
