Precondition: **(n, m, k, d) are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ d ≤ m; rows is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, and costs is a list of n integers where each element is calculated by the function func_1(row, d) for the corresponding row in rows.**
