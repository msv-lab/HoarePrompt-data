### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic for calculating the minimum cost of installing supports for building bridges.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   row[0] = 1
   for i in range(1, d):
       row[i] = row[i] + 2
   ```
   This part initializes the first `d` elements of the row to be `1` and `2` more than their initial values, respectively. This is a placeholder and doesn't reflect the actual logic needed to place supports.

2. **Min-Heap Initialization**:
   ```python
   min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]
   heapify(min_heap)
   ```
   The min-heap is initialized with the first `d` elements of the row. This is a good start, but the heap is not used effectively to place supports.

3. **Heap Operations**:
   ```python
   for i in range(d, len(row)):
       while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
           pass
       row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
       heappush(min_heap, e)
       heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
   ```
   This loop iterates through the remaining elements of the row and tries to place supports. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed:
   - The condition `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)` checks if the index of the popped element is too far away from the current position `i`. If true, it simply skips the iteration.
   - The support placement logic `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` is incorrect because it adds the cost of the previous support to the current cell without considering the actual placement constraints.

4. **Return Statement**:
   ```python
   return row[-1]
   ```
   The function returns the last element of the row, which is not the correct cost calculation.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   ```python
   n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
   rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
   ```
   This correctly parses the input and initializes the rows.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   ```python
   costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
   ```
   This calls `func_1` for each row and stores the result in `costs`. However, as we have seen, `func_1` does not correctly calculate the cost.

3. **Total Cost Calculation**:
   ```python
   total_costs = []
   for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
       total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
   print(min(total_costs))
   ```
   This correctly calculates the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum cost.

### Conclusion

The primary issue lies in the `func_1` function, which incorrectly calculates the cost of placing supports. The provided solution does not correctly handle the placement of supports according to the given constraints. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum cost of installing supports for building bridges.
