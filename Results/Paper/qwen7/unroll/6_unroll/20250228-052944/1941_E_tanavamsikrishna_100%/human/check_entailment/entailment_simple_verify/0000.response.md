### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic for calculating the minimum cost of installing supports for building bridges.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The function starts by setting `row[0] = 1`, which is a placeholder for the first support.
   - It then increments the values from `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` by 2, ensuring they are initially set to 3.

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A min-heap is initialized using the first `d` elements of the row.
   - This heap helps in keeping track of the minimum cost up to the current position.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - For each position `i` starting from `d` to the end of the row:
     - The function pops the smallest element from the heap and checks if its index is within the required distance `d` from the current position.
     - If the distance is valid, it updates the current position `i` with the sum of the popped value and the current depth, plus 1.
     - The updated value and its index are pushed back into the heap.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns the last element of the row, which represents the minimum cost for placing supports in the row.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function reads the dimensions and the parameters of the problem.
   - It then reads the depths of the river cells for each row.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each row, the function calls `func_1` to compute the minimum cost of placing supports.
   - These costs are stored in the `costs` list.

3. **Total Cost Calculation**:
   - The function iterates through the `costs` list in chunks of size `k` and calculates the sum of each chunk.
   - These sums are stored in the `total_costs` list.
   - Finally, the minimum value from `total_costs` is printed.

### Detailed Evaluation

1. **Heap Usage**:
   - The use of a min-heap is appropriate for finding the minimum cost up to a certain point.
   - The heap ensures that the function efficiently updates the costs while maintaining the required distance constraint.

2. **Distance Constraint**:
   - The function correctly ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d` by checking the indices when updating the heap.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases well by ensuring that the first and last supports are always placed.
   - It also correctly updates the costs for placing supports in all valid positions within the constraint `d`.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of the program is sound and correctly implements the required constraints.
   - The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for placing supports in each row and then finds the minimum total cost for placing supports in `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic for calculating the minimum cost of installing supports for building bridges. The original assessment was accurate in identifying potential issues but did not fully validate the correctness of the solution.
