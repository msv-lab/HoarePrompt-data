Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces; rows and costs remain unchanged**.

The code reads four integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. The values of `rows` and `costs` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. The precondition that `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100`, `3 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5`, and `1 ≤ d ≤ m` remains valid.
