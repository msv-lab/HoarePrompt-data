The only variable in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `remaining_vertices`. For the loop to execute the first time, `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one vertex.

Right before the loop, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing all vertices from 1 to n. Since the set contains all vertices initially, it means `remaining_vertices` is non-empty and the loop can execute the first time without any adjustments.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing all vertices from 1 to n**
