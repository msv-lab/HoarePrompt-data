### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Conditions for Output**:
   - If `k == n`, the program outputs `[1] * n`, which means it outputs an array of `n` ones. This is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of an array of ones are sorted.
   - If `k == 1`, the program outputs a range from `0` to `n-1`. This is also a valid solution because only one cyclic shift (the original array) is sorted.
   - If neither condition is met, the program outputs `-1`, indicating that no valid array exists under the given constraints.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `k == n` and `k == 1` correctly.
   - It also correctly handles the case where no valid array can be formed by returning `-1`.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the result for each test case on a new line, which matches the required format.

### Conclusion:
The program logic is sound and correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
