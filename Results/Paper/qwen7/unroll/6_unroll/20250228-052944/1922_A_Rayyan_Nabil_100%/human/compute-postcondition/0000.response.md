Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and it is assigned the value of `int(input().strip())`.**

This means that the initial value of `t` within the range 1 to 1000 has been replaced by the integer input from the user, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
