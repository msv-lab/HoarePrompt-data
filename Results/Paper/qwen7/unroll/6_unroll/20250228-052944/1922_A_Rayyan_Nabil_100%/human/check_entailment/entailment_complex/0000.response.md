Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it, but string `c` does not. A template is a string where lowercase letters in the template must match the corresponding letters in `a` and `b`, but uppercase letters in the template prevent the corresponding letters in `a` and `b` from matching the lowercase version of the template letter.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if there is at least one index `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - This logic is correct because if there is such an index, it means that we can use a template where the corresponding character is lowercase (since both `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]`).
   - If no such index exists, the function correctly returns 'NO'.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, and calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.
   - It collects the results of `func_1` for each test case and prints them.
   - This logic is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

4. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It correctly identifies whether a template exists for each test case based on the given conditions.
   - The output format matches the required output format.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
