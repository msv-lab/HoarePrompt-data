The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it checks if the sum of \(a\) and \(b\) is even. If the sum is even, it prints 'bob'. If the sum is odd, it prints 'alice'. After processing all test cases, it returns nothing explicitly but prints 'bob' or 'alice' for each test case based on the condition.
