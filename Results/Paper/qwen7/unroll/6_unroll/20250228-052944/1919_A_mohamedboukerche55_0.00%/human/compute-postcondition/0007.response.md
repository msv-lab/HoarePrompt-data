Postcondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. After the loop executes all iterations, there will be t pairs (a, b) stored in memory. If the sum of a and b is even, the sum is handled accordingly in the if part. If the sum of a and b is not even, the sum is handled accordingly in the else part.**
