Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner**: The given solution checks if `(a + b) % 2 == 0` and decides the winner based on that condition. This is not correct because the winner depends on whether `a` or `b` is odd or even after all possible moves, not just the sum of `a` and `b`.

2. **Game Strategy**: The key insight here is that the player who starts with an odd number of coins (after removing one coin per turn) will always be able to force the opponent into a losing position. Specifically:
   - If `a` is odd and `b` is even, Alice can always win by ensuring she ends up with an odd number of coins.
   - If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Bob can always win by ensuring he ends up with an odd number of coins.
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd or both are even, the outcome depends on whose turn it is to move. However, since Alice starts, she can always force Bob into a losing position if she plays optimally.

### Correct Solution:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Determine the winner based on the parity of a and b
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            if a % 2 == 0:
                print('Bob')
            else:
                print('Alice')
        else:
            if a % 2 != 0:
                print('Alice')
            else:
                print('Bob')

func()
```

This solution correctly determines the winner based on the initial values of `a` and `b` and the rules of the game.
