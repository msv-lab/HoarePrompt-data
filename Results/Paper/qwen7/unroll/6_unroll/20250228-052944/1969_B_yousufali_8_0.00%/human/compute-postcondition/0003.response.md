Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a number of test cases (t) and for each test case, it accepts a binary string (s). It returns the count of '1's in each binary string s.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases where each case involves a binary string. For each binary string, it counts the number of '1's present and returns these counts.
