### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The goal is to find the minimum total cost to achieve a sorted string.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` reads an input that is expected to be a list of integers but should actually be a single binary string.
   - It iterates through the list and counts the number of 1s and 0s.
   - The logic seems to be flawed because it assumes the input is a list of integers rather than a single binary string.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` will also be incorrect.

4. **Expected Behavior:**
   - The program should read a binary string and calculate the minimum cost to sort it using cyclic shifts.
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the binary string input.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the binary string input and instead processes a list of integers. Therefore, the function `func_1` and `func_2` do not solve the problem as intended.

### Correctness:
**False**
