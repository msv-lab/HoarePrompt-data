Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list `lst` of `2n` integers.
   
2. **Splitting the List:**
   - The list `lst` is split into two halves: `lft` (first `n` elements) and `rgt` (last `n` elements).

3. **Finding Duplicates and Singles:**
   - The program iterates through `lft` to find duplicates (`ldb`) and singles (`sng`).
   - It sorts `lft` and checks adjacent elements to identify duplicates and singles.
   - It does the same for `rgt` to find duplicates (`rdb`).

4. **Constructing Arrays `l` and `r`:**
   - The program tries to construct arrays `l` and `r` of length `2k` using the identified duplicates and singles.
   - It prints the elements of `l` and `r` in the required format.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Handling Duplicates and Singles:**
   - The logic for identifying duplicates and singles is correct. However, the approach might not always ensure that the XOR values of `l` and `r` are equal.
   - The program only considers the first occurrence of each duplicate and single, which might not be sufficient to guarantee the XOR condition.

2. **Ensuring XOR Condition:**
   - The program does not explicitly check or balance the XOR values of `l` and `r`. It simply prints elements from the lists without ensuring the XOR condition is met.
   - This could lead to incorrect outputs where the XOR values of `l` and `r` are not equal.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the XOR condition cannot be satisfied with the current approach.
   - For example, if the XOR of the first half is significantly different from the XOR of the second half, the current method might fail.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` and `r` will always be equal. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all test cases.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
