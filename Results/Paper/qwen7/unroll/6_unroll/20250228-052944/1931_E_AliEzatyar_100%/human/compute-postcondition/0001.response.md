Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `num`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being set to `len(num) - 1`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to `len(num) - 1`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. If `i` is less than 0, the loop will stop.

4. **Initial state of `num`**: The variable `num` is a list, but its initial state is not specified. However, for the loop to execute at least once, `num` must have at least one element. If `num` is empty, `len(num)` would be 0, and `len(num) - 1` would be -1, making the loop not execute at all.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Based on the above points, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to `len(num) - 1` and that `num` has at least one element.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`counter` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, `num` must have at least one element**.
