Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the game rules as described. Specifically, the program does not simulate the game turns properly. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function counts trailing zeros in a string representation of a number. However, the problem description involves reversing the digits of the number, not just counting trailing zeros.

2. **Game Logic**: The program does not simulate the actual game turns where Anna reverses a digit and Sasha concatenates two numbers. Instead, it calculates some derived values (`total_digits`, `zeros`) and makes a decision based on those values without actually simulating the game.

3. **Decision Making**: The program decides the winner based on the difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero`. This approach does not accurately reflect the game's logic. The game's outcome depends on whether Sasha can form a number of at least \(10^m\) after Anna's move, not just on the count of trailing zeros or the total length of the numbers.

To correctly implement the game, the program needs to simulate each player's turn and check if Sasha can win after Anna's move. The current implementation does not do this, making it incorrect.
