Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1` Usage**: The function `func_1` is used to count trailing zeros in a string representation of a number. However, this function is not being called correctly in the context of the problem. The logic should focus on the digit reversal and the game rules rather than just counting trailing zeros.

2. **Game Logic Implementation**: The logic for determining the winner is flawed. The solution attempts to calculate the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros, but it does not correctly implement the game rules or the optimal strategy for the players.

3. **Reversing Digits**: The problem requires reversing the digits of the chosen number, but the code does not perform this operation. Instead, it uses `func_1` which is irrelevant to the problem.

4. **Optimal Strategy**: The solution does not account for the optimal strategies of both players. It assumes that the player who leaves the opponent in a losing position will win, but the actual implementation does not reflect this logic.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to implement the game logic properly, considering the optimal moves for both players. Hereâ€™s a more accurate approach:

```python
def reverse_number(num):
    return int(str(num)[::-1])

def game_winner(n, m, numbers):
    # Convert all numbers to their reversed form
    reversed_numbers = [reverse_number(num) for num in numbers]
    
    # Sort the numbers in descending order
    reversed_numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Check if the largest number is already greater than or equal to 10^m
    if reversed_numbers[0] >= 10**m:
        return 'Sasha'
    
    # Check if the sum of the smallest two numbers is greater than or equal to 10^m
    if len(reversed_numbers) > 1 and reversed_numbers[0] + reversed_numbers[1] >= 10**m:
        return 'Sasha'
    
    # If neither condition is met, Anna wins
    return 'Anna'

n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    answers[test] = game_winner(n, m, array)

for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

This revised solution correctly implements the game logic and checks the conditions to determine the winner based on the optimal moves.
