You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a list of integers, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and the length of the list n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and there is a parameter m for each test case such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: counter is the number of zeros from the end of the list num until the first non-zero element.
    return counter
    #The program returns the number of zeros from the end of the list 'num' until the first non-zero element
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter num, which is a list of integers. It returns the count of zeros from the end of the list until it encounters the first non-zero element.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the number of zeros from the end of the list 'num' until the first non-zero element


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
