Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of an integer. It is used to identify how many zeros are at the end of each number in the list.
2. **Game Logic**:
   - The logic aims to determine whether Sasha or Anna wins based on the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros.
   - The key idea is to check if the difference between the total number of digits and the sum of the largest even number of trailing zeros is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\). If true, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.
3. **Summarizing the Logic**:
   - The program iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros.
   - It then checks if the difference between the total number of digits and the sum of the largest even number of trailing zeros is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\).
   - Based on this condition, it decides the winner.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like numbers with no trailing zeros or only zeros correctly.
   - The sorting and selection of the largest even number of trailing zeros seem to be implemented correctly.
5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct winner for each test case based on the logic described.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the game logic and should produce the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
