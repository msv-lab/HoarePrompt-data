Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) and checks the conditions for a stair and a peak.
3. The conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`) are correctly implemented.
4. If neither condition is met, it correctly outputs 'NONE'.
5. The program handles the specified input and output format accurately.

Given the execution summary matches the problem description and the program logic is correct, the program should work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
