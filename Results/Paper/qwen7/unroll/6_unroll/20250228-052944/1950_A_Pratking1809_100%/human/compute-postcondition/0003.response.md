Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE', depending on the input values for each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each line `i` (where `i` ranges from `0` to `q-1`), the output will be:

- 'STAIR' if the first number `a` is less than the second number `b`, which is also less than the third number `c`.
- 'PEAK' if the first number `a` is less than the second number `b`, but greater than the third number `c`.
- 'NONE' in all other cases.

The exact sequence of these outputs cannot be determined without knowing the specific inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
