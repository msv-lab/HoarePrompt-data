Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE', depending on the input values for each iteration of the loop. The number of lines will be equal to the value of `q`. Each line's content is determined by the condition checks involving `a`, `b`, and `c` for that specific iteration. The initial values of `t` and `q` will remain unchanged, but `t` will not be used within the loop, so its value does not affect the output.
