Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither, based on the problem description. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads three digits and checks the conditions for a stair and a peak. The program outputs the correct string for each case ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE"). Therefore, the given program is correct.
