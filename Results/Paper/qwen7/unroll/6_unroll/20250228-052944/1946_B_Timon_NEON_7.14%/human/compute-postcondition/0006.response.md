Output State: `max_sum` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list.

Explanation: The provided code aims to find segments in the array where the sum of elements is non-negative and updates the maximum segment found. However, the code logic does not seem to correctly update the `max_segment` or `new_segment` lists during the iterations. Given the initial conditions and the nature of the operations inside the loop, no segment with a positive sum is found, hence `max_sum` remains 0, `new_segment` and `max_segment` remain empty, and `segments_variants` also remains empty.
