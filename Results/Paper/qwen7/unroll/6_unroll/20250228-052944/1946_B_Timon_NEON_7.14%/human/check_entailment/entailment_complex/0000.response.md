### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
   - The key insight is that we can insert the sum of the entire array `k` times to maximize the sum.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the remainder of the input number when divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It is used to ensure the result fits within the required modulo constraint.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The intention seems to be to find the segment with the maximum non-negative sum in the array.
   - However, the implementation is flawed:
     - The `max_segment` and `new_segment` lists are not updated correctly.
     - The logic to find the maximum segment is not implemented properly.
     - The function ultimately returns `[-1]` instead of the expected maximum segment sum.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is not referenced in the given code and appears to be unused.
   - It initializes `answer` to 0 but does not return any value, making it irrelevant to the solution.

5. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic is in the loop where it calculates the maximum possible sum using the formula:
     \[
     \text{answer} = \text{max\_segment[0]} \times 2^k + \text{sum}(a) - \text{max\_segment[0]}
     \]
   - However, since `func_2` returns `[-1]` for `max_segment`, the formula simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{answer} = 0 \times 2^k + \text{sum}(a) - 0 = \text{sum}(a)
     \]
   - This means the program essentially just returns the sum of the array without considering any operations, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Given that `func_2` incorrectly returns `[-1]` and the main logic does not account for the operations as intended, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

### Correctness:
**False**
