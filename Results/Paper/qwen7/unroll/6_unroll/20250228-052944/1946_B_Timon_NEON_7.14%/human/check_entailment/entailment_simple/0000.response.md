Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of an array through \( k \) operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The maximum possible sum can be achieved by repeatedly inserting the largest possible sums.
   - The sum of the array can be increased by inserting the sum of the entire array multiple times.

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - **func_2**: This function is supposed to find the maximum segment sum in the array. However, the logic in `func_2` is flawed. It does not correctly identify and update the maximum segment sum.
   - **func_1**: This function correctly calculates the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - **Main Logic**: The main part of the program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum using the formula \( \text{max\_segment} \times 2^k + \text{sum}(a) - \text{max\_segment} \).

4. **Issues in `func_2`**:
   - The function does not properly handle the segments and their sums.
   - It initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` incorrectly and does not update them correctly.
   - The final return value of `func_2` is always `[-1]`, which is incorrect.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the maximum segment sum, we should use Kadane's algorithm or a similar approach to find the maximum subarray sum.
   - Once the maximum segment sum is found, the rest of the logic is correct.

Given these points, the function `func_2` is incorrect, but the rest of the program logic is correct. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program depends on the accuracy of `func_2`.

Correctness: **False**
