Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `number` representing the sum of the original array and a non-negative integer `quantity` representing the number of operations k. It initializes a variable `answer` to 0 and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `answer` variable holds the value 0, regardless of the input parameters.**
