Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Incomplete Function Definitions**: 
   - `func_3` is defined but not implemented. It should calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after performing `k` operations.
   - `func_2` returns a segment which is not used in the context of calculating the maximum sum after `k` operations.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is designed to find a segment with the maximum sum, but it does not account for the operations where you can insert the sum of any subarray into the array. This logic is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

3. **Missing Main Logic**:
   - The main logic to calculate the maximum sum after `k` operations is missing. The problem allows inserting the sum of any subarray into the array, which means you can effectively increase the sum of the array significantly by strategically choosing subarrays to sum and insert.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is correctly handled in `func_1`, but it should be applied to the final result of the sum calculation.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, you need to understand that you can always choose to insert the sum of the entire array multiple times to maximize the sum. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from math import *

def max_possible_sum(n, k, arr):
    total_sum = sum(arr)
    # Since we can insert the sum of the array multiple times, the maximum sum
    # is the total sum of the array multiplied by (k+1) modulo 10^9 + 7
    max_sum = (total_sum * (k + 1)) % 1000000007
    return max_sum

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(max_possible_sum(n, k, arr))
```

This approach directly calculates the maximum possible sum by leveraging the fact that you can insert the sum of the array multiple times, and it handles the modulo operation correctly.
