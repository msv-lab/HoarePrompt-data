Output State: `max_sum` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is [[0, 0, len(arr) - 1]], `total_max_segment` is [0, 0, len(arr) - 1].

Explanation: The loop iterates over each `segment` in `segments_variants`. During each iteration, it checks if the first element of `total_max_segment` is less than the first element of the current `segment`. If it is, `total_max_segment` is updated to the current `segment`. Since `segments_variants` only contains one segment initially and no new segments are added or modified within the loop, `total_max_segment` will be updated to the only segment available in `segments_variants`, which is `[0, 0, len(arr) - 1]`. All other variables (`max_sum`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
