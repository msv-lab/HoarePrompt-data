Postcondition: **`max_sum` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is [[0, 0, len(arr) - 1]], `total_max_segment` is [-1]**.

Explanation: Since the `if` condition `len(total_max_segment) == 1` is true (as `total_max_segment` initially contains only one segment `[0, 0, len(arr) - 1]`), the `if` part is executed. As a result, `total_max_segment` is updated to `[-1]`. All other variables (`max_sum`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop or the `if` condition.
