Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing integers \( n \) and \( k \), followed by two lists of integers \( a \) and \( x \). It then determines whether a player can survive all monster attacks based on the given constraints and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. The function processes each test case independently and outputs the result for each one.**
