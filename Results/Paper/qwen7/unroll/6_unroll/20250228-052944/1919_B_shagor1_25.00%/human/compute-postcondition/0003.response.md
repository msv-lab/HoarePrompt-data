Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'.
   - `i` will iterate over each character in the string `s`.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string (i.e., it must contain at least one character).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `s` is a string of length `n`, and `n` is an input integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 5000`, `s` must be a non-empty string.
   - The variable `i` will take the value of each character in `s` during each iteration, starting from the first character.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `s` and `i`. Specifically, `s` must be a non-empty string, and `i` should be set to the first character of `s`.

**Final State**:
- `s` must be a non-empty string (i.e., it must have at least one character).
- `i` should be the first character of `s`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `s`**
