The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000), and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters '+' and '-'. For each test case, it calculates and prints the value of `n - 2 * neg`, where `neg` is the count of '-' characters in `s`. If `n` equals `neg`, it prints `n` instead.
