Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases defined within its scope. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000), and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'. The function returns the sum of integers represented by the string `s`, where '+' corresponds to 1 and '-' corresponds to -1, for each test case.**

This means the function iterates through a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n`. For each string `s`, it calculates the sum of the integers represented by the characters in `s` (i.e., +1 for '+' and -1 for '-') and returns this sum for each test case.
