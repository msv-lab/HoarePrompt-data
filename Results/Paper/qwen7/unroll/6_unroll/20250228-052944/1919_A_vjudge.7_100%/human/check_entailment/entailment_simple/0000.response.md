### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`test`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Condition Check**: For each pair of integers `a` and `b`, it checks if `(a + b) & 1 == 0`. This bitwise operation checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even.
   - If `(a + b) & 1 == 0`, the result is `True`, which means the sum is even. According to the logic, Bob wins.
   - If `(a + b) & 1 != 0`, the result is `False`, meaning the sum is odd. According to the logic, Alice wins.

3. **Output**: Based on the result of the condition check, it prints either "Bob" or "Alice".

### Analysis of the Game Logic:

- **Game Dynamics**: The key observation here is that the game involves alternating moves where each player can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet. The critical insight is that the parity (even or odd nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`) determines the winner.
- **Optimal Play**: If the total number of coins is even, Bob can always force a win by mirroring Alice's moves. Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice can force a win by ensuring she always leaves an even number of coins for Bob.

Given the provided examples and the logic implemented in the program, the program correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:

Correctness: **True**
