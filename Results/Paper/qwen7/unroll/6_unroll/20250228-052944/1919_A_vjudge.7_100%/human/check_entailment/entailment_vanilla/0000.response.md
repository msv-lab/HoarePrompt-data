### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - Each player alternates turns.
   - On each turn, a player can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet.
   - A player loses if they cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet has 0 coins).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the moves of the first player (Alice).
   - If `a + b` is odd, the first player (Alice) can force the second player (Bob) into a losing position.

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The given function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using the expression `a + b & 1 == 0`.
     - If true, it prints 'Bob'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic correctly identifies that if the sum of coins is even, Bob can always win by mirroring Alice's moves.
   - If the sum is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by making optimal moves.

Given this analysis, the provided function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
