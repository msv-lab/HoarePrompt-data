Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner based on whether the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd.
2. The logic in the provided code checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using the expression `(a + b) & 1 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'.
3. This logic aligns with the optimal strategy for the game:
   - If the sum of the coins is even, Bob can always force the sum to be odd on the next turn, ensuring he wins.
   - If the sum of the coins is odd, Alice can force the sum to be even on the next turn, ensuring she wins.
4. The code correctly implements this logic without any errors or logical flaws.

Therefore, the given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
