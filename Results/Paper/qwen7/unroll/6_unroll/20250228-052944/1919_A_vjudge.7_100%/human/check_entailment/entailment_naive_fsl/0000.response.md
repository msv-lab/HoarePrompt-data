Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic. According to the problem description, the winner is determined by whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. However, the program's logic is flawed because it does not account for the optimal strategy of the players. Specifically, the program assumes that the player whose turn it is will always lose if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, which is not necessarily true.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `1 1`

According to the problem description, the game would proceed as follows:
1. Alice starts with 1 coin and Bob with 1 coin.
2. Alice can either swap wallets or remove a coin from her wallet. If she removes a coin, she will have 0 coins, and Bob will still have 1 coin.
3. Bob's turn: He can either swap wallets or remove a coin from his wallet. If he removes a coin, he will have 0 coins, and Alice will still have 0 coins.
4. Alice cannot make a valid move since she has no coins left, so Bob wins.

However, the provided program incorrectly prints "Bob" for this case. It checks if the sum of the coins (`a + b`) is even and prints "Bob" if it is, which is not correct based on the game rules. The correct output for this case should be "Alice" because Alice can force Bob into a losing position by removing her coin first, leaving Bob with the last move where he will be unable to make a valid move.

Therefore, the program does not handle the game logic correctly and is incorrect.
