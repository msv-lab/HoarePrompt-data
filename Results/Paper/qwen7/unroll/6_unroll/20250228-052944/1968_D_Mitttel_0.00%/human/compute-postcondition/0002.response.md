Output State: **`score` is 0, `start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= start_pos <= n, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9, `p` is a list of integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of integers representing the array a; `current_pos` is set to `start_pos`, `steps` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `steps` to 0. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of all variables except `steps`, which is now explicitly set to 0.
