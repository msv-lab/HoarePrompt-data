Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle arrays where the first and last elements are different, but there are differing elements between them. Here is an example:

Consider the array `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`. According to the problem description, the optimal solution would involve selecting `i = 3`, `j = 4`, and `x = 7` to change the array to `[4, 3, 7, 7, 1, 1, 3]`, which requires 2 operations. However, the program incorrectly calculates the result as 6.

The program logic only checks if the first and last elements are the same and does not account for the optimal way to make all elements equal by considering all possible subarrays. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
