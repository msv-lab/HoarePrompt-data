The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by positive integers `t`, `n`, and `k` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26). For each test case, it generates and prints a string consisting of `n*k` characters, which are the first `k` letters of the English alphabet ('a' to 'z'), repeated as necessary to form the desired length. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no explicit return value.
