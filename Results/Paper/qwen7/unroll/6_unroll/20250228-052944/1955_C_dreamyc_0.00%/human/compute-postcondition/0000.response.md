Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n integers such that 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.**

The code `nums = deque(nums)` changes the type of the `nums` variable from a list to a deque (double-ended queue). All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
