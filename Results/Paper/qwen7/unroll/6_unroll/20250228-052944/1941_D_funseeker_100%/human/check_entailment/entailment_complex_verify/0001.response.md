### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly uses custom functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` to parse the input. This part is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

3. **Loop Through Throws**:
   - The program iterates through each throw using a loop that runs `m` times. For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`. This part is also correct.

4. **Direction Handling**:
   - If the direction is '0' or '?', the program adds the clockwise position `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - If the direction is '1' or '?', the program adds the counterclockwise position `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - This logic correctly handles both the specified and uncertain directions.

5. **Update Set**:
   - After processing each throw, the program updates the set `ans` with the new possible positions. This ensures that only valid positions are kept.

6. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and if so, replaces it with `n` to handle the modulo operation edge case. This is correct.

7. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the number of possible players and their sorted positions. This matches the required output format.

Upon closer inspection, there is one potential issue with the handling of the set `ans` during the update process. Specifically, the use of `temp` as an intermediate set before updating `ans` might lead to redundant or unnecessary elements being added to `ans`. Here’s why:

- In each iteration, the set `temp` is updated with possible new positions based on the current set `ans`. However, since `temp` is a separate set, it might include duplicates or unnecessary elements that do not need to be checked again in subsequent iterations.
- Instead of using `temp` as an intermediate set, directly updating `ans` with the new possible positions can simplify the logic and avoid potential redundancy.

To ensure correctness, let’s verify the logic step-by-step:

- **Step 1**: Initialize `ans` with the starting player `x`.
- **Step 2**: For each throw, update `ans` directly with the new possible positions based on the direction `c` and the distance `r`.
- **Step 3**: Ensure that `ans` only contains unique positions.
- **Step 4**: Handle the edge case where `0` is in `ans` by replacing it with `n`.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and the handling of the set `ans` is sound.
