### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program uses custom functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` to parse the input. These functions correctly read a line, an integer, and multiple integers respectively. This part is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

3. **Loop Through Throws**:
   - The program iterates through each throw using a loop that runs `m` times. For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`. This part is also correct.

4. **Direction Handling**:
   - If the direction is '0' or '?', the program adds the clockwise position `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - If the direction is '1' or '?', the program adds the counterclockwise position `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - This logic correctly handles both the specified and uncertain directions.

5. **Update Set**:
   - After processing each throw, the program updates the set `ans` with the new possible positions. This ensures that only valid positions are kept. This part is correct.

6. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and if so, replaces it with `n` to handle the modulo operation edge case. This is correct.

7. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the number of possible players and their sorted positions. This matches the required output format.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The original assessment accurately describes the correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
