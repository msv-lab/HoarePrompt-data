### Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the provided Python program is correct. Let's evaluate the program step-by-step using the annotated code and the problem description to verify its correctness.

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()`: Converts the result of `func_1()` to an integer.
   - `func_3()`: Converts the result of `func_1()` to a list of integers.
   - `func_4()`: Implements the main logic of the program.

2. **Main Logic in `func_4()`**:
   - **Initialization**: 
     - `n`, `m`, and `x` are read and initialized.
     - A set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`.
   - **Processing Throws**:
     - For each of the `m` throws, the distance `r` and direction `c` are read.
     - A temporary set `temp` is used to store new possible positions.
     - Depending on the direction (`c`), the ball can move either clockwise (`0` or `?`) or counterclockwise (`1` or `?`).
     - The new positions are calculated using modular arithmetic to handle circular movement.
   - **Final Adjustments**:
     - If the position `0` is in `ans`, it is replaced with `n` to handle the circular nature properly.
     - The length of `ans` and the sorted list of `ans` are printed.

3. **Annotations and Validation**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The logic in `func_4()` accurately reflects the problem requirements.
   - The use of sets ensures that only unique positions are considered.
   - The handling of unknown directions (`?`) is appropriate, allowing both possible movements.

Given the thorough analysis and the annotations, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all possible inputs and conditions appropriately, ensuring that the final output is the correct set of possible positions for the ball.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description and the detailed analysis.
