Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Parsing**:
   - `func_1()` reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()` calls `func_1()` and returns an integer value, which is the number of test cases (`t`).
   - `func_3()` calls `func_1()`, splits the resulting string into integers, and returns a list of these integers, which are the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for a test case.
   - `func_4()` is responsible for processing each test case, which involves reading the details of each throw and determining the possible positions of the ball.

2. **Processing Each Test Case in `func_4()`**:
   - `func_4()` correctly initializes the set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
   - It then iterates over each throw, reading the distance `r` and direction `c` from the input.
   - Depending on whether `c` is '0', '1', or '?', it updates the set `temp` with the possible new positions of the ball.
   - After processing all throws, it ensures that the position `n` is included if `0` is in the set `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the number of elements in `ans` and the sorted list of elements in `ans`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic for updating the set `temp` correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise movements, as well as uncertain directions.
   - The inclusion of `n` when `0` is in `ans` is correct because in modular arithmetic, adding or subtracting `n` from a position is equivalent to wrapping around to the beginning or end of the circle.
   - The final output is formatted correctly, providing the number of possible players and their sorted positions.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
