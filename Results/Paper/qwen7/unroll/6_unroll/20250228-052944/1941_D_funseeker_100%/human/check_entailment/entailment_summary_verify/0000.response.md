### Reasoning:

The original assessment claims that the provided Python program is correct. Let's analyze the program and its behavior based on the problem description and the function summary.

#### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a single line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()`: Calls `func_1()` and converts the result to an integer.
   - `func_3()`: Calls `func_1()` and splits the result into a list of integers.
   - `func_4()`: Implements the main logic of the program.

2. **Main Logic in `func_4()`**:
   - **Initialization**: 
     - Reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
     - Initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - **Processing Each Throw**:
     - For each throw, reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
     - Updates the set `ans` to include the new possible positions based on the direction:
       - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, adds the clockwise position `(q + r) % n`.
       - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, adds the counterclockwise position `(q - r) % n`.
   - **Handling Position 0**:
     - If `0` is in the set `ans`, replaces it with `n`.
   - **Output**:
     - Prints the number of unique positions in `ans`.
     - Prints the sorted list of unique positions.

#### Validation Using Function Summary:

The function summary states that the function processes a series of throws to determine the possible positions of the ball and outputs the total number of unique positions along with the positions themselves. This aligns with the program's logic.

#### Edge Cases and Potential Issues:

1. **Handling '?'**:
   - The program correctly handles the `'?'` character by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise movements.
   
2. **Position Wrapping**:
   - The use of modulo operation `% n` ensures that the positions wrap around correctly when moving beyond the last player.

3. **Initial Player and Final Output**:
   - The program starts with the correct initial player and updates the set of possible positions accurately.
   - The final output is formatted correctly, listing all unique positions in ascending order.

Given the thorough handling of all possible inputs and conditions, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.
