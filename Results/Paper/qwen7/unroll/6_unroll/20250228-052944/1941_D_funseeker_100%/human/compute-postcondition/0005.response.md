Postcondition: **The set `ans` contains the positions of all players who could potentially have the ball after `m` throws, including the position 0, based on the operations defined in the loop. Each operation either adds or subtracts `r` from the current player's position modulo `n`, and the result is added to the set `temp`. Since `c` can be '0', '1', or '?' which allows both addition and subtraction, the final set `ans` includes all possible positions that the ball could have been passed to through the given operations.**
