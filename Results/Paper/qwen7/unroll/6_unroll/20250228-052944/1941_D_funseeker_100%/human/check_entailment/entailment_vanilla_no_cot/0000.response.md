Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after \(m\) throws. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input using custom functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` which handle reading a line, reading an integer, and reading space-separated integers respectively. These functions are used consistently throughout the program.

2. **Initialization**: The initial position of the ball is stored in `x`. A set `ans` is initialized to contain only the starting position `x`.

3. **Processing Throws**: For each of the \(m\) throws, the program processes the distance `r` and the direction `c`:
   - If the direction is known (`'0'` for clockwise or `'1'` for counterclockwise), the program updates the set `ans` accordingly.
   - If the direction is unknown (`'?'`), both possible directions are considered.

4. **Adjusting for Zero Indexing**: After processing all throws, the program adjusts for the possibility of the ball being at position 0, which is equivalent to position \(n\).

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the number of possible positions and the sorted list of these positions.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program accurately computes the possible positions of the ball after \(m\) throws, making the correctness evaluation **True**.
