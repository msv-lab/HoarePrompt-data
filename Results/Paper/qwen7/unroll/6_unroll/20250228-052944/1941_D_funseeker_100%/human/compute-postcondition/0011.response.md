Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies that it works with global variables n, m, x, and ans. It returns a string containing the distance r and the direction c separated by a space.**

This means the function `func_4` does not take any parameters but uses global variables `n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans` to determine its behavior and return a string with distance and direction.
