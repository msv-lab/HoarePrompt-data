Functionality: **The function processes a series of throws (represented by distances and directions) among a group of players to determine the possible positions where the ball could end up. Initially, the ball starts with a specific player. For each throw, the ball can either move forward or backward by a certain distance, wrapping around the group of players if necessary. After processing all throws, the function outputs the total number of unique positions the ball could be in and lists these positions in ascending order. If the position 0 is among the possible positions, it is replaced with position `n`.**
