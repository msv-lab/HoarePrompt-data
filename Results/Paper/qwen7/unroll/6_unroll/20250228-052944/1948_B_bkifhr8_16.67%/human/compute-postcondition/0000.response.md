Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50; `sorted_lst` is a list of integers which is a sorted version of `lst`.**

The code `sorted_lst = sorted(lst)` sorts the list `lst` in ascending order and assigns the sorted list to `sorted_lst`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged, and the new list `sorted_lst` contains the same elements as `lst` but in sorted order. The conditions on the length and range of values in `lst` remain the same.
