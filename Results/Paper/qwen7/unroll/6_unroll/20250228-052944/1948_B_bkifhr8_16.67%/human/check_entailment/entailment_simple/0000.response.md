Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the list and checking if any element greater than 10 can be split into its constituent digits to potentially sort the list.
2. However, the program does not correctly implement the logic for splitting elements greater than 10 into their digits and inserting them back into the list. Instead, it directly modifies the list by popping and inserting elements without properly handling the splitting process.
3. The `func_1` function checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the problem.
4. The main issue lies in the logic of how elements are split and reinserted. The program does not ensure that the new elements are inserted in the correct positions to maintain the order during the transformation process.

Given these points, the program is not correctly implementing the required operations to transform the list into a sorted one. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
