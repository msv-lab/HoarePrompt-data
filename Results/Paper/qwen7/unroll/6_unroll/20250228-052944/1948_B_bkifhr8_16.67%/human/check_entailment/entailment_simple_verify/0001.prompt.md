You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list 'lst' is sorted in non-decreasing order.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Processing Each Element:**
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element (`list1[p - 1]`) is greater than the next element (`list1[p]`) and the current element is greater than 10, it performs the specified operation:
     - It removes the current element.
     - Inserts the digits of the removed element into the array in the same position.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After processing all elements, the program calls `func_1(list1)` to check if the array is sorted.
   - `func_1` sorts the array and checks if it matches the original array. If it does, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Operations:**
   - The program assumes that performing the operation once will always lead to a closer state towards sorting the array. However, the problem allows performing the operation multiple times, and the program does not account for this.
   - The logic inside the loop only handles one operation per element, but the problem statement allows multiple operations.

2. **Lack of Iterative Operation Execution:**
   - The program does not ensure that the array is processed until no more operations can be performed. This means it might miss out on making the array sorted if multiple operations are needed.

3. **Incorrect Functionality:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted, but the problem requires transforming the array to be sorted, not just checking if it is already sorted.

### Conclusion:

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It fails to handle the possibility of multiple operations and does not ensure the array is transformed to be sorted.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
