### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summaries step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if it's possible to sort the array by repeatedly splitting elements greater than 10 into their individual digits and inserting them back into the array in the correct positions.

#### Given Code Analysis:
1. **Main Loop**: The main loop iterates over the array and checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and greater than 10. If so, it splits the element and reinserts the digits.
   ```python
   for p in range(1, len(list1)):
       if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
           a = list1[p - 1]
           list1.pop(p - 1)
           list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
           list1.insert(p, a % 10)
   ```
   This part of the code is problematic because it does not ensure that the array is sorted after each operation. It simply splits and reinserts the digits without checking if the resulting array is sorted.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   ```python
   def func_1(lst):
       sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
       return lst == sorted_lst
   ```
   This function is correct in its purpose but is used incorrectly in the main logic.

3. **Main Logic**: The main logic calls `func_1` after attempting to sort the array by the flawed method described above. Since `func_1` only checks if the array is sorted and does not perform the necessary operations to achieve a sorted array, the main logic is flawed.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- `func_1` checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, but it does not help in achieving the sorted state through the described operations.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
3
12 28 5
```
- The correct transformation should be:
  - Split `28` into `[2, 8]`.
  - Insert `2` before `28` and `8` after `28`.
  - Resulting array: `[2, 8, 5]`, which is sorted.

However, the given program does not perform this transformation correctly. It simply checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and greater than 10, but it does not ensure that the array is sorted after each operation.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem statement. The logic to split and reinsert digits is flawed, and the use of `func_1` does not help in achieving the sorted state.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
