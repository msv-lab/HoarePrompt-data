Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the main loop that attempts to transform the array into a sorted one is flawed. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Operation Handling**: The code attempts to split elements greater than 10 into their individual digits and insert them back into the list. However, the implementation does not handle this correctly. It simply removes the element and inserts its tens and units digits without considering the order or the impact on the rest of the list.

2. **Sorting Check**: The `func_1` function checks if the list is sorted after the operations but does not actually perform the necessary operations to achieve a sorted list. This means the function will only confirm if the initial list was already sorted, not if it can be made sorted through the allowed operations.

3. **No Transformation Logic**: The main loop does not properly simulate the process of breaking down numbers and reinserting them in a way that could potentially sort the list. Instead, it incorrectly manipulates the list without ensuring the resulting list would be sorted.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine whether the array can be transformed into a sorted array using the specified operations.

Correctness: **False**
