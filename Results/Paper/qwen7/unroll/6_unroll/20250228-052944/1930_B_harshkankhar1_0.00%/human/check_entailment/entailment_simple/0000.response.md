### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is evident from the loop `for _ in range(int(input())):` which iterates `t` times.

2. **Permutation Generation**: Within each test case, the program generates a permutation of length `n`. It starts by creating a list `a` containing integers from `1` to `n`.

3. **Modification of Permutation**: The list `a` is modified such that every other element starting from the first element is reversed. This ensures that no two consecutive pairs of elements `(p_i, p_{i+1})` have the property that `p_i` divides `p_{i+1}`. Specifically, `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses every second element starting from the first element.

4. **Output**: The modified list `a` is printed, which is the required permutation.

5. **Constraints Compliance**: The solution adheres to the constraints provided, as it generates a valid permutation for each test case and ensures that the sum of all `n` values does not exceed `10^5`.

Given these points, the program logic is sound and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

### Correctness:
