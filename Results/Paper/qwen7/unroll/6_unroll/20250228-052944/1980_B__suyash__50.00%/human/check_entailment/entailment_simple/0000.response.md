Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
2. Specifically, the program reads the entire line of space-separated integers as a single string and then splits it, which is incorrect because the input for `a` should be split into individual integers.
3. The program also incorrectly handles the removal of elements from the list `o` and does not properly account for the frequency of elements when determining if the favorite cube will be removed.
4. The logic for checking if the favorite cube will be removed is flawed and does not match the problem description.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
