You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: The output state will depend on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop. For each input, the program checks if it's possible to select elements from the list `o` such that the element at index `f-1` appears before or at position `k-1` in the sorted list, considering the frequency of other elements. If such a selection is possible, it prints 'YES', 'MAYBE', or 'NO' based on the remaining positions after accounting for the frequencies of other elements. The final output state will be a series of 'YES', 'MAYBE', or 'NO' based on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the favorite cube is removed after sorting but before the removal of the first `k` cubes. Here’s an example to illustrate this:

Consider the following input:
```
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```
- The original list of values is `[4, 3, 3, 2, 3]`.
- After sorting, the list becomes `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`.
- The favorite cube (index 2) has the value `3`, which is now in the second position.
- The program checks if the favorite cube is in a position greater than `k-1` (which is `1` in this case). Since the favorite cube is in the second position, it incorrectly prints "NO".

However, according to the problem description, the first two cubes are removed, so the list becomes `[3, 3, 3, 2]`. The favorite cube (value `3`) is now in the first position and will be removed. Therefore, the correct output should be "YES".

This discrepancy shows that the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the favorite cube is moved to a position that would make it eligible for removal after the initial sorting step. Thus, the program is incorrect.
