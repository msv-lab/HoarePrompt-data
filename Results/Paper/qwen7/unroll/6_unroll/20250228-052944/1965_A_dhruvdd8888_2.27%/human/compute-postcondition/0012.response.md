Output State: **`cd` is 0, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code simply initializes the variable `cd` to 0. This does not affect the values of `nums` or any other variables. Therefore, the initial state of `nums` remains unchanged, and `cd` is set to 0.
