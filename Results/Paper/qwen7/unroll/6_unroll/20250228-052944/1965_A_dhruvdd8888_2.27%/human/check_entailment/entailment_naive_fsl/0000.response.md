Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the game rules. Specifically, the program assumes that the game state can be reduced to a simple comparison of consecutive elements in the sorted list of pile sizes. However, this approach fails to consider the optimal strategy for the game.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
3
1 2 3
```
- Expected Output: `Alice`
- Program Output: `Bob`

The program sorts the piles and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is 1. If the count of such differences is odd, it prints "Bob". Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

However, in the given test case, Alice can win by removing 1 stone from each pile, making the piles [0, 1, 2]. Then, Bob has no valid move because he cannot remove 1 stone from a pile of size 0. Therefore, Alice wins.

The program incorrectly determines the winner based on a flawed heuristic rather than simulating the optimal moves for both players. Thus, it does not meet the problem description for all potential cases.
