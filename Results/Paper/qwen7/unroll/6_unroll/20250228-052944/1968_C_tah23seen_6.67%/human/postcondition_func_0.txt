The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` of `n-1` integers (where each integer is between 1 and 500, inclusive, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, inclusive) and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is the maximum of `arr[i] + ans[i-1]` and `arr[i]`. Additionally, `ans[n-1]` is set to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.
