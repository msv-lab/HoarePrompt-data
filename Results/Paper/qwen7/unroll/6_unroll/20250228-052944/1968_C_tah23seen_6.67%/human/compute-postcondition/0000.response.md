Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; `ans` is a list of n zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The length of `ans` is `n`, which is the same as the length of `arr` but `arr` contains `n-1` integers. The values of `arr` and `n` remain unchanged from the initial state.
