#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; `ans` is a list of n elements where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is the maximum value between `arr[i] + ans[i-1]` and `arr[i]`.
    #
    #This output state describes how the `ans` list is populated based on the given loop logic, ensuring that each element in `ans` is at least as large as the corresponding element in `arr` plus the cumulative sum up to that point in `ans`.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is the maximum value between `arr[i] + ans[i-1]` and `arr[i]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` of `n-1` integers (where each integer is between 1 and 500, inclusive, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, inclusive) and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is the maximum of `arr[i] + ans[i-1]` and `arr[i]`. Additionally, `ans[n-1]` is set to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.
