Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; `ans` is a list of n elements where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is the maximum value between `arr[i] + ans[i-1]` and `arr[i]`.

This output state describes how the `ans` list is populated based on the given loop logic, ensuring that each element in `ans` is at least as large as the corresponding element in `arr` plus the cumulative sum up to that point in `ans`.
