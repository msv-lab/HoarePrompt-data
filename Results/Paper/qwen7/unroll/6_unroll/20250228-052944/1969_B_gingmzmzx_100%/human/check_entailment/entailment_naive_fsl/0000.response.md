Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The logic in the program does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts and instead seems to be counting something else.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
101011
```

Expected output:
```
9
```

However, the program outputs:
```
5
```

The program counts the number of times a '0' appears before a '1' in the string, which is not the correct approach for calculating the minimum cost of cyclic shifts. The correct solution would involve identifying the longest prefix that is already sorted and then calculating the cost based on the positions of the elements that need to be shifted.

A correct approach would involve finding the longest prefix that is already sorted and then calculating the cost based on the positions of the elements that need to be shifted. This involves more complex logic to determine the optimal cyclic shifts.
