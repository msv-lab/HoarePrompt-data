Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking specific conditions and printing the appropriate responses. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - If `n == k`, the program prints "YES", 1, and 1. This is correct because if Alice has exactly `k` coins and the price per jewel is 1, she will buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `n + 2 > k * 2`, the program prints "YES", 2, and the values `n - k + 1` and `1`. This condition ensures that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by buying from two stalls. The first stall should have a price such that Alice can buy as many jewels as possible with her coins, and the second stall should have a price of 1 to ensure she buys the exact number of jewels needed.
   - Otherwise, the program prints "NO". This is the correct approach since if neither of the above conditions is met, it is impossible to arrange the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints "YES" or "NO" for each test case, which is correct.
   - If "YES" is printed, it also prints the number of stalls (either 1 or 2) and the prices for those stalls, which is also correct according to the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
