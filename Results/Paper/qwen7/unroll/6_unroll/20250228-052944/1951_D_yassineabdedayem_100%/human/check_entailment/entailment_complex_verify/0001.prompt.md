You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        
        if n == k:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(1)

    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop. For each input pair (n, k), the program checks conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO'. If 'YES', it also prints additional details. Since the input values are not specified, the exact output cannot be determined without knowing the specific inputs. However, the output will consist of lines printed during each iteration, with each line either stating 'YES' followed by integers, or 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). It checks specific conditions involving these integers and prints 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional details if applicable. Specifically, it prints 'YES' when \( n \geq k \) or when \( n + 2 > 2k \), and prints 'NO' otherwise. For each 'YES' case, it also outputs two more integers. The final state of the program is that it has processed all test cases and printed the corresponding results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the desired number of jewels `k`.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks two main conditions:
     - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", sets up 1 stall with price 1, and exits.
     - If `n + 2 > k * 2`, it prints "YES", sets up 2 stalls, with the first stall having a price of `n - k + 1` and the second stall having a price of 1, and exits.

3. **Handling Other Cases:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of Conditions:

- **Condition 1: `n == k`**
  - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, setting up 1 stall with price 1 allows her to buy exactly `k` jewels. This condition is handled correctly.

- **Condition 2: `n + 2 > k * 2`**
  - This condition checks if Alice can buy more than `k` jewels if she were to buy from two stalls. However, this condition does not cover all possible scenarios:
    - It assumes that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by buying from two stalls, but it doesn't ensure that the prices are set correctly to achieve exactly `k` jewels.
    - For example, if `n = 7` and `k = 3`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` is true (`9 > 6`), but the solution should be to set up 1 stall with price 2, not 2 stalls with specific prices.

- **Other Cases:**
  - The program incorrectly handles other cases by printing "NO" without providing a valid configuration of stalls and prices.

### Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case: `7 3`**
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - Actual Output: `YES`
   - Explanation: Alice has 7 coins and needs 3 jewels. Setting up 1 stall with price 2 allows her to buy 3 jewels.

2. **Test Case: `6 4`**
   - Expected Output: `NO`
   - Actual Output: `YES`
   - Explanation: Alice has 6 coins and needs 4 jewels. The program incorrectly sets up 2 stalls, which is not necessary and doesn't guarantee exactly 4 jewels.

3. **Test Case: `255 8`**
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - Actual Output: `YES`
   - Explanation: Alice has 255 coins and needs 8 jewels. The program incorrectly sets up 2 stalls instead of 8 stalls with appropriate prices.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly handle all test cases and provides incorrect solutions for some scenarios. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
