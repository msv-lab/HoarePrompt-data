Output State: The output state depends on the input values for each iteration of the loop. For each input pair (n, k), if n equals k, it prints 'YES', 1, 1. If n + 2 is greater than 2k, it prints 'YES', 2, followed by two space-separated integers where the first is n - k + 1 and the second is 1. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The exact output will vary based on the specific inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
