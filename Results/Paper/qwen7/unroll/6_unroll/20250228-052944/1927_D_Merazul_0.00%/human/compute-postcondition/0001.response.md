Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], and q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; t is the first element returned by the lambda function R().**

The code `t, = R()` executes the lambda function `R()`, which presumably returns a tuple. The first element of this tuple is assigned to `t`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
