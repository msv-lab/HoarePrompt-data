Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], and q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. Each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n; R is a lambda function that takes input and splits it into a tuple of integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` which takes input from the user and splits it into a tuple of integers. However, it does not assign this lambda function to any variable or use it to modify any existing variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `q` remain unchanged, and the lambda function `R` is defined but not used in the current context.
