You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        
        n, k = list(map(int, l1))
        
        arr = []
        
        k0 = k
        
        i = 0
        
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1
        
        ans = []
        
        c = 0
        
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lists `ans` for each test case, where each list contains integers generated based on the binary representation of `k` and padded to length `n` with zeros if necessary. Specifically, for each test case, the list `ans` will contain powers of 2 corresponding to the positions set in the binary representation of `k`, followed by zeros to make the total length of the list equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. The test case constraints are that `t` (an external variable representing the number of test cases) is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Based on the values of `n` and `k`, the function returns a specific value or performs a certain action.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
