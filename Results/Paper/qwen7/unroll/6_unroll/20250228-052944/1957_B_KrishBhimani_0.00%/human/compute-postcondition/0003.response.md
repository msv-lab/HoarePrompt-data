Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. The test case constraints are that `t` (an external variable representing the number of test cases) is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Based on the values of `n` and `k`, the function returns a specific value or performs a certain action.**

Note: The exact return value or action is not specified in the given information, only the constraints and the structure of the input.
