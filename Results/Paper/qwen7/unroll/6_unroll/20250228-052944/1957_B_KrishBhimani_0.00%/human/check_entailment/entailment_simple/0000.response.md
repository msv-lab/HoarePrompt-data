Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Binary Representation and Bitwise OR**:
   - The program constructs an array `arr` containing indices of bits set in the binary representation of `k`.
   - It then constructs the final answer array `ans` by setting the corresponding bit positions in `ans` to `1 << i` (powers of 2) and padding the rest with zeros to ensure the length of `ans` is `n`.

3. **Sum Constraint**:
   - The program ensures that the sum of elements in `ans` equals `k` by setting the last element to `k - sum(ans)` when necessary.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is exactly the length of `arr` by setting the last element to `k0 - sum(ans)`, ensuring the sum constraint is met.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed array `ans` for each test case, which satisfies the conditions of the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
