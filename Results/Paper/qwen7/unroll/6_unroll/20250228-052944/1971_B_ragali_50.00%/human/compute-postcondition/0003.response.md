Output State: The output will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' for each string `s` entered during the loop iterations, based on whether the string can be split into two halves such that one half is a rotation of the other. If such a condition is met, it prints the rotated string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The specific strings and their rotations depend on the inputs provided during the loop iterations.
