Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count occurrences of each element in `arr`. This is necessary to track how many times each element appears.

3. **Finding the MEX:**
   - The goal is to find the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `c` at the end of the game.
   - The program attempts to find the first missing integer in the sequence from `0` to `n-1` by checking if each integer `i` is present in `mpp` (the counter dictionary).

4. **Logic Issues:**
   - The logic for determining the MEX is flawed:
     - The variable `first` is used to indicate whether a unique element has been found, but it is not correctly utilized.
     - The program only checks if an integer `i` is not in `mpp.keys()` or if `mpp[i] == 1` under certain conditions, which does not fully capture the optimal strategy for both players.
     - The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, nor does it ensure that the game proceeds optimally according to the rules.

5. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.
   - The optimal strategy involves Alice picking elements such that the resulting array `c` has the highest possible MEX, and Bob picking elements to reduce the MEX.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. It fails to simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and does not accurately compute the MEX of the final array `c`.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
