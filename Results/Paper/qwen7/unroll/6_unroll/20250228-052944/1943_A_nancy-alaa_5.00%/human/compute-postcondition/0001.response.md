Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and an array a of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. After executing the loop, for each test case, either the smallest missing index in the array or the second smallest index with a frequency of 1 in the array (if the first such index has already been found) is printed.
