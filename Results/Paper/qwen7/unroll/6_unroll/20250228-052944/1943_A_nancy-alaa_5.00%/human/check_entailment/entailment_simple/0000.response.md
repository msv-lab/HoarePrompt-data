Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by determining the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. However, the logic implemented in the function `func()` does not correctly simulate the game or compute the MEX of the resulting array `c`. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Game Simulation**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as described. Instead, it tries to find the smallest missing index or the second smallest unique index in the input array `arr`, which does not accurately reflect the game's rules or the final state of the array `c`.

2. **MEX Calculation**: The program aims to print the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game. However, since the game is not properly simulated, the output will not be the correct MEX value for the array `c`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The problem requires both players to play optimally, meaning Alice will try to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it. The current implementation does not account for these strategies.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
