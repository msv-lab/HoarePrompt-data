Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the squared distances between pairs of opposite corners of the square and printing the smaller of the two distances. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the calculated distance is indeed the side length of the square.

To correctly determine the area of the square, we need to identify the side length of the square. Given that the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by finding the differences in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of the corners. Specifically, the side length should be the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates or the maximum and minimum y-coordinates.

Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:
1. The program calculates the squared distance between pairs of opposite corners, which does not necessarily represent the side length of the square.
2. The logic of comparing the two distances and printing the smaller one is flawed because both distances might not represent the side length of the square.

To fix the program, we need to:
1. Identify the minimum and maximum x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
2. Calculate the side length as the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates or y-coordinates.
3. Compute the area of the square as the side length squared.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
