Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. All other information about the test cases themselves (such as the coordinates of the squares) is not yet available and will be read in subsequent lines.
