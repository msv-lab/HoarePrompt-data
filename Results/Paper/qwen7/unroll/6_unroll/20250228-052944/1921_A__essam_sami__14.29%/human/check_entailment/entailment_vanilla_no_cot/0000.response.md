Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The logic used to determine which pair of points represents the diagonal of the square is flawed. The program simply compares the squared distances between the points and prints the smaller one, which does not guarantee that it is the diagonal of the square.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to identify the pairs of points that form the diagonals of the square. The correct approach involves checking all possible pairs of points to see if they satisfy the conditions of being diagonally opposite corners of the square. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Check all pairs of points to find the diagonals
        for i in range(4):
            for j in range(i+1, 4):
                dx = points[i][0] - points[j][0]
                dy = points[i][1] - points[j][1]
                dist = dx * dx + dy * dy
                
                found = True
                for k in range(4):
                    if k != i and k != j:
                        if (points[k][0] - points[i][0]) * (points[k][0] - points[j][0]) + \
                           (points[k][1] - points[i][1]) * (points[k][1] - points[j][1]) != dist:
                            found = False
                            break
                
                if found:
                    area = dist
                    break
        
        print(area)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the correct diagonal is identified and then calculates the area of the square using the distance formula.
