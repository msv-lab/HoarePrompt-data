Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It processes t test cases, where each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The function checks if these points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the given points form a valid square.**

Note: Since the function does not explicitly return a value in the given format, the output is inferred based on the description of the task.
