Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum possible value that the entire array can be reduced to using the specified operations.
2. The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:
   - For `n == 2`, the solution prints the minimum value of the array, which is not necessarily the correct approach.
   - For larger arrays, the solution attempts to find the second largest value among all possible triplets, but this does not guarantee the maximum possible value that the entire array can be reduced to.
3. The correct approach would involve repeatedly applying the median operation to reduce the array until all elements are the same. The maximum possible value would be the highest median value encountered during this process.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
