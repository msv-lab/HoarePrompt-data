Output State: **t is an input integer, and the initial state of `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 500, the value of `t` is now an integer input from the user, but it still needs to be within the same range. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.
