Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Length Check**: For each test case, it correctly handles the special case when `n == 2`. In this case, the output should be the minimum value of the array, which is correctly handled.
3. **Finding the Maximum Median**: The program attempts to find the maximum possible median value by considering all possible triplets in the array. However, there are a few issues with this approach:
   - **Incorrect Logic**: The logic to find the maximum median is flawed. The program sorts every triplet `[a[i], a[i+1], a[i+2]]` and takes the middle value (`temp[1]`). This does not guarantee finding the global maximum median. For instance, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The program would take the middle value of each triplet, but the true maximum median could be found by collapsing the entire array to the highest value using the allowed operations.
   - **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases or larger arrays effectively. It only considers triplets, which might miss the possibility of collapsing the entire array to a single value.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program fails to account for the possibility of collapsing the entire array to the highest value through the allowed operations.

Correctness: **False**
