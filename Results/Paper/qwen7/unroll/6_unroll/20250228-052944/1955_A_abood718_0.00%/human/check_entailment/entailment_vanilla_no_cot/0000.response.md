Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for Odd Number of Yogurts**: The program does not correctly handle the case when the number of yogurts `A` is odd. It prints `X` (which is `A // 2`) instead of calculating the correct minimum cost.
   
2. **Redundant Print Statement**: There is an extra `print(X)` statement before calculating the final cost, which should be removed.

3. **Logic for Odd Number of Yogurts**: The logic for handling odd numbers of yogurts is incomplete. Specifically, it should calculate the cost of buying as many pairs as possible under the promotion and then add the cost of the remaining yogurt(s).

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of pairs and remaining yogurts
        pairs = A // 2
        remaining = A % 2
        
        # Calculate the cost
        if B * 2 < C:
            total_cost = A * B
        else:
            total_cost = pairs * C + remaining * B
        
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum cost for any number of yogurts, whether even or odd.
