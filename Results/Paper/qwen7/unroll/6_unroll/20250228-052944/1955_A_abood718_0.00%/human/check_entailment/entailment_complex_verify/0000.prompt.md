You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each line containing the result of one of the conditions in the loop. Specifically, for each iteration \(i\):
    #
    #- If \(B \times 2 < C\), the output will be \(A \times B\).
    #- If \(A\) is even and \(B \times 2 \geq C\), the output will be \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\).
    #- Otherwise, the output will be two lines: \(X = \frac{A}{2}\) and \(X \times C + B\).
    #
    #The total number of lines in the output will be equal to the number of test cases specified by `int(input())`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates and prints one of three possible outputs based on the values of \(a\) and \(b\):

- If \(2b < c\), it prints \(a \times b\).
- If \(a\) is even and \(2b \geq c\), it prints \(\frac{a \times c}{2}\).
- Otherwise, it first prints \(X = \frac{a}{2}\) and then prints \(X \times c + b\).

After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value, only printing the results to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them individually, especially when the total number of yogurts is odd. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3 5 11
```
- According to the problem description, it is more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles (since 11 * 1.5 = 16.5, which is greater than 15).
- However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as `X * C + B`, where `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2, leading to a cost of 11 + 5 = 16, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should calculate the minimum cost by considering both the individual purchase and the promotion purchase options. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b * 2 < a * 2:
            # Calculate the cost using the promotion
            full_sets = n // 2
            remaining = n % 2
            cost = full_sets * b + remaining * a
        else:
            # Calculate the cost without promotion
            cost = n * a
        print(cost)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles all cases correctly by comparing the cost of buying yogurts individually versus in pairs.
