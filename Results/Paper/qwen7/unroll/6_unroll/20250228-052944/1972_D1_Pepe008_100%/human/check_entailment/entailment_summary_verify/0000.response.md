### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided program is incorrect:

1. **Problem Statement Analysis**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function summary states that the program calculates a sum based on a specific formula and prints the result minus 2. However, this formula and the subsequent checks do not align with the problem statement.

3. **Provided Code Analysis**:
   - The code iterates through values of \(i\) from 1 to \(b\) and uses a formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) to calculate some value \(x\).
   - It then adds \(x\) to a sum and checks additional conditions to add 1 more to the sum. These operations do not correctly reflect the problem's requirements.

4. **Example Test Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the test case \((10, 8)\):
     - The correct pairs that satisfy the condition are:
       - \((1, 1)\)
       - \((2, 1)\)
       - \((2, 2)\)
       - \((3, 1)\)
       - \((4, 1)\)
       - \((5, 1)\)
       - \((6, 1)\)
       - \((6, 2)\)
       - \((6, 3)\)
       - \((7, 1)\)
       - \((8, 1)\)
       - \((9, 1)\)
       - \((10, 1)\)
       - \((10, 2)\)
       - \((10, 3)\)
       - \((10, 4)\)
     - The correct output should be 14.
   - However, the provided program outputs a different result, indicating that the logic is flawed.

Given these points, the original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
