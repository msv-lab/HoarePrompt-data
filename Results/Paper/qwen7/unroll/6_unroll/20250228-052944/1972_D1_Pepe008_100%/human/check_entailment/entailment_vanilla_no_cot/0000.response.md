Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The logic inside the loop and the conditions used do not accurately reflect the required conditions for the problem statement. Specifically, the formula used to calculate `x` and the conditions to check for valid pairs do not align with the problem's requirements.

To solve this problem correctly, you should use the greatest common divisor (GCD) and iterate through possible values to check if the pair `(a, b)` satisfies the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
