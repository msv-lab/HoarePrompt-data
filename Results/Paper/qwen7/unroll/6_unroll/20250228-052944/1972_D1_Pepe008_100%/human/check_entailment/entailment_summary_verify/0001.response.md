### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified several issues with the given program. Let's summarize and confirm the key points:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Pairs**:
   - The program uses a loop to iterate from `1` to `b` and calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. This does not relate to the problem's constraints.
   - The condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is irrelevant to the problem.

2. **Misunderstanding of Conditions**:
   - The program does not correctly check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - It does not use the greatest common divisor (\(\gcd\)) in the calculation, which is crucial for the problem.

3. **Redundant and Incorrect Operations**:
   - The program adds `1` to `suma` under certain conditions without properly checking the required conditions of the problem.

The original assessment provided a corrected version of the program, which iterates through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\), calculates \(\gcd(a, b)\), and checks if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This approach is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

Given the analysis and the provided corrected version, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The given program is incorrect, and the original assessment correctly identified the issues and provided a corrected version.
