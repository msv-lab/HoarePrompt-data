### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Original Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns `True`, leading to printing `0` as the beauty.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns `False`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - This approach does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty because it doesn't consider the optimal arrangement of elements to maximize the beauty.

3. **Optimal Solution**:
   - To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array such that the smallest element is followed by the largest, then the second smallest by the second largest, and so on.
   - This ensures that the positive differences (larger minus smaller) are maximized while minimizing the negative differences (smaller minus larger).

#### Corrected Version:
The original assessment suggests a corrected version where the array is sorted and the beauty is calculated by alternating the smallest and largest elements. This approach is correct because it ensures the maximum possible positive differences.

#### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**: `a` is a list of integers representing the array elements, and `num2` is the length of the array.
- **`func_1` Function**:
  - Checks if the array is sorted.
  - Returns `True` if sorted, otherwise `False`.
- **Main Logic**:
  - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints `0`.
  - Otherwise, it sorts the array `a`.
  - It then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements after sorting.
  - This approach does not account for the optimal arrangement of elements.

Given the detailed analysis, the original program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty. The provided solution in the original assessment is indeed correct, as it arranges the elements optimally to maximize the beauty.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect because it does not achieve the maximum beauty. The provided solution in the original assessment is correct.
