Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in the `func_1` function and how the main logic is implemented.

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this is not the correct approach for finding the maximum beauty.
   - The function returns `True` if the array is sorted, which means it will always print `0` for the beauty, regardless of the actual arrangement of elements.

2. **Main Logic Issue:**
   - The main logic sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. This approach does not guarantee the maximum beauty.
   - To maximize the beauty, we should place the smallest element at the beginning and the largest at the end, and then alternate placing the next smallest and largest elements in between.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    
    # Sort the array to find the minimum and maximum values
    a.sort()
    
    # Initialize the beauty
    beauty = 0
    
    # Calculate the maximum beauty by placing the smallest and largest values alternately
    for x in range(num2 // 2):
        beauty += a[-(x + 1)] - a[x]
    
    if num2 % 2 != 0:
        beauty += a[num2 // 2]
    
    print(beauty)
```

This corrected version ensures that the maximum beauty is calculated correctly by alternating the placement of the smallest and largest elements.
