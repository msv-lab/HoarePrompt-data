State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the array elements, and order is 0, `i` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `num2` must be greater than 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, num2):`, which means `i` will take values from 1 up to but not including `num2`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be initialized to a value within the range specified by `range(1, num2)`. This means `i` must be at least 1.
3. Additionally, since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to but not including `num2`, `num2` must be greater than 1 to ensure there is at least one iteration of the loop.
4. The variable `order` is not involved in the loop condition and its initial value (0) does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being greater than or equal to 1 and `num2` being greater than 1.
