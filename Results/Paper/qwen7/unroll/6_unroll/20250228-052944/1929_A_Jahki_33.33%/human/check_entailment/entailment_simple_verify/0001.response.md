### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and then summing the differences between consecutive elements. However, let's break down the program step-by-step to ensure every part of the logic is sound.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.

2. **Checking Initial Order:**
   - The `func_1` function checks if the array is already in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already in non-decreasing order, the beauty is 0 because the sum of differences will be zero.

3. **Sorting and Calculating Beauty:**
   - If the array is not in non-decreasing order, the program sorts the array.
   - It then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

### Detailed Reasoning

1. **Initial Check with `func_1`:**
   - The `func_1` function is unnecessary because sorting the array will always yield the maximum possible beauty, regardless of the initial order.
   - If the array is already in non-decreasing order, sorting it again will not change anything, and the beauty will still be zero.
   - However, this check does not affect the final result since the beauty calculation is done after sorting.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements, maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative ones.

3. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - After sorting, the beauty is correctly calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through the example provided to verify the correctness:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `[2, 1, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Beauty: `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
  - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - Beauty: `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `[3, 4, 3, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
  - Beauty: `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `[2, 1]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
  - Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and then summing the differences between consecutive elements. The initial check with `func_1` is redundant but does not affect the correctness of the final result.

**Final: True**

The original assessment is accurate.
