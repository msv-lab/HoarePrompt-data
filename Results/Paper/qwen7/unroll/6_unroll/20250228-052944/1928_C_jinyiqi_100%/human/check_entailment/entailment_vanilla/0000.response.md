Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Iterating Over Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - It then reads the position `n` and the number `x` Vasya received from the input for each test case.

2. **Checking Conditions for Valid `k`:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
     - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`
   - These conditions ensure that `n + x - 2` and `n - x` are even, which is necessary for the settling pattern to repeat correctly.

3. **Finding Divisors Using `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` finds all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - The divisors are stored in `output1` and `output2`, and then combined and reversed to get the divisors in ascending order.

4. **Filtering Valid `k` Values:**
   - For each divisor `s` obtained from `func_1`, the program checks if `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
   - If true, it appends `(s + 2) / 2` to the `output` list.

5. **Removing Duplicates and Printing Result:**
   - The `output` list is converted to a set to remove duplicates.
   - The length of the set is printed, which gives the number of valid `k` values.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Condition Checking:**
   - The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` are correct because they ensure that the total length of the sequence is even, which is required for the repeating pattern to work.

2. **Divisor Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates all divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`.

3. **Filtering Valid `k` Values:**
   - The filtering condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` ensures that the value of `k` is valid according to the problem statement.

4. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - Converting the list to a set removes any duplicate values, ensuring that each valid `k` is counted only once.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid `k` values for each test case based on the provided constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
