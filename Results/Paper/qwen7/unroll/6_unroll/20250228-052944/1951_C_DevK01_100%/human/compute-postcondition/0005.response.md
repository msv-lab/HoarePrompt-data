Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) along with a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It calculates a cost based on certain conditions involving \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), and prints the cost for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs the calculated costs for each case.**
