Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved here are `_` (a dummy variable) and `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: The state before the loop starts is given as `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `t` is now the input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer and \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it is guaranteed that `t` will always be greater than 0. However, we need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once, which means `t` should be at least 1.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `t`, and it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `t` must be at least 1.

**State: **`t` must be at least 1**.
