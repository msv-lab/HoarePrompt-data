Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved here are:
   - `_`: A placeholder variable used in the loop (though its name doesn't matter as it's not referenced in the loop body).
   - `int(input())`: This is the condition that determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: 
   - The variable `_` is a placeholder and doesn't affect the loop's execution directly since it's not used in the loop body.
   - The key object is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must evaluate to a positive integer (greater than 0).

3. **Consider the initial state**: The initial state given is that `ans_list` is an empty list. This state does not affect the loop's execution because the loop's condition is based on user input, not the state of `ans_list`.

4. **Formulate the required state**: The only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is the one that ensures `int(input())` evaluates to a positive integer.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**`int(input())` must evaluate to a positive integer**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`int(input())` must evaluate to a positive integer**
