Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for a in ans_list:`. The variables involved here are `a` and `ans_list`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `ans_list`**: The problem states that `ans_list` is a list containing integers where each integer is calculated based on the given logic within the loop for each set of inputs provided. However, the exact values in the list depend on the inputs provided during the execution of the loop.

3. **Adjust the State**: For the loop to execute, `ans_list` must be a non-empty list because the loop iterates over each element in `ans_list`. The variable `a` will take on the value of each element in `ans_list` during each iteration of the loop.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `ans_list` is a non-empty list. Since the exact values of the elements in `ans_list` are determined during the loop execution, we don't need to specify the actual values but rather the condition that ensures the loop can execute.

**State:**
- `ans_list` must be a non-empty list.

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`ans_list` is a non-empty list containing integers**
