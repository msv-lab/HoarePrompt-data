Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Counting Substrings:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" using the `count` method.
   - It also counts the occurrences of the substring "mapie".

3. **Calculation:**
   - The formula used in the program is `x + y - z`, where:
     - `x` is the count of "map".
     - `y` is the count of "pie".
     - `z` is the count of "mapie".
   - The program prints the result of this calculation.

### Reasoning:

- **Substrings "map" and "pie":**
  - The program correctly counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie". However, counting these separately without considering overlaps might lead to double-counting certain characters.

- **Substring "mapie":**
  - The program counts the occurrences of "mapie". This is useful because "mapie" covers both "map" and "pie" simultaneously. By subtracting `z` (the count of "mapie"), we avoid double-counting.

- **Double-counting:**
  - When "mapie" is present, it includes both "map" and "pie". Therefore, counting "map" and "pie" separately would indeed double-count the characters in "mapie". Subtracting `z` corrects this double-counting.

- **Minimum Deletions:**
  - The goal is to find the minimum number of deletions to make the string beautiful. The formula `x + y - z` effectively calculates the minimum deletions needed:
    - Each occurrence of "map" or "pie" that is not part of "mapie" needs to be deleted.
    - Each occurrence of "mapie" is already covered and does not need additional deletions.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful by using the formula `x + y - z`. This approach ensures that overlapping substrings are not double-counted.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
