Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty according to the given problem description. The logic in the program seems to be attempting to find the minimum number of splits required to ensure no increasing pairs exist within the subsequences, which is not equivalent to minimizing the penalty \(p(s) + p(t)\).

To illustrate why this program is incorrect, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
5
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
```

The program incorrectly calculates the penalty as 0 because it tries to minimize the number of elements that are out of order rather than the number of increasing pairs in the subsequences. This approach fails to account for the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty.

A correct solution would involve a different approach, such as sorting the array and then finding the longest non-decreasing subsequence to determine the minimum penalty. The given program does not implement this logic, leading to incorrect results.
