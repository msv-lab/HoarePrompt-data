Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten. The program seems to attempt to use binary search and prefix sums, but the logic is flawed. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not correctly handle the scenario where a slime can eat its neighbor if it is strictly larger. Here is an example to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
5
2 2 3 1 4
```

Expected output:
```
2 1 2 1 -1
```

However, the program's output will be incorrect. For instance, the third slime (size 3) should take 2 seconds to be eaten by the fourth slime (size 1), but the program might incorrectly calculate this or other values due to the flawed logic. This example shows that the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten, thus making the program incorrect.
