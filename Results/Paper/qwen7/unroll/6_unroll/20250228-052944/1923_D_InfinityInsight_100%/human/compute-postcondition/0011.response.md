Output State: `a` is a list of n non-negative integers representing the sizes of the slimes, `left` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to that index, `last` is a list of n elements where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the slime size before the current index (if the slime size changes, the index is updated), `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is either -1 or the position from which the current slime size can be traced back to its first occurrence without encountering a smaller slime size in between.
