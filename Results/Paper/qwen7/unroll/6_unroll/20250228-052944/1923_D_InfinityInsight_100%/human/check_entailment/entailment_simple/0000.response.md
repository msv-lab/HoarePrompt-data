### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime, based on their sizes. A slime can only eat another if it is strictly larger. If no slime can eat another, the process stops.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function uses binary search to find the index of a given value in a sorted list. It correctly handles cases where the value is not found.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function calculates the minimum time for each slime to be eaten. It maintains two lists: `left` for cumulative sums and `last` for tracking the last occurrence of each unique slime size. The logic iterates through the slimes, checking conditions to update the answer list `ans`.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - **Cumulative Sum (`left`)**: This list helps in quickly calculating the total size of slimes up to any point.
   - **Last Occurrence (`last`)**: This list keeps track of the last index where each unique slime size occurred, which is crucial for determining the path of a slime's growth.
   - **Main Logic**:
     - For each slime, it checks if it can immediately eat the previous slime.
     - If not, it calculates the cumulative sum difference to find the farthest previous slime that could have been eaten by the current slime.
     - It uses `func_1` to find the appropriate index in the cumulative sum list and updates the answer accordingly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Slimes of the same size: The `last` list ensures that the correct index is used even if multiple slimes have the same size.
   - No possible eating: If no slime can eat another, `-1` is correctly returned.

5. **Overall Flow**:
   - The program correctly processes each test case, updating the answer list for each slime based on the given rules.
   - The use of binary search in `func_1` and the cumulative sum approach in `func_2` ensure efficient computation.

### Conclusion:
The provided code accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. Each step and condition is handled correctly, and the overall structure ensures that the minimum time for each slime to be eaten is calculated properly.

### Correctness:
**True**
