Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime.
2. The solution involves two main functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. `func_1` is used to find the index of a value in the sorted list, but it seems unnecessary in the context of the problem, as it is not directly used in `func_2`.
4. `func_2` is the core function that calculates the minimum time for each slime to be eaten. It does so by:
   - Keeping track of the last occurrence of each slime size.
   - Using cumulative sums to keep track of the total size up to each slime.
   - For each slime, it checks if it can eat its left or right neighbor and calculates the minimum time based on these conditions.
5. The main part of the code runs the `func_2` twice: once on the original list and once on the reversed list. It then compares the results to get the final answer for each slime.
6. Given the detailed execution summaries, the logic in `func_2` appears to correctly implement the problem's requirements. The double run and comparison ensure that the result is accurate for each slime.
7. There are no apparent logical errors or inconsistencies in the provided code that would violate the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
