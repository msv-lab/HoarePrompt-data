Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`, the value of `t` is updated to the input integer, while the constraints on `t` remain the same. The other variables (`n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}`) are not affected by this line of code.
