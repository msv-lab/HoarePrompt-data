You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and `2n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum values of all possible pairs of integers and stores these sums in a list `ans_f`. Finally, it prints each sum in `ans_f`. The function does not return any value but modifies the list `ans_f` and prints its contents.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans_f` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a variable `ans` to 0 to keep track of the score.
   - It reads the list of integers into `lst` but does not convert the string input correctly.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program attempts to process the list `lst` by repeatedly taking the minimum of the first two elements and adding it to the score.
   - However, the logic for processing the list is flawed. Specifically:
     - The condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is incorrect because it should handle the general case where the list has more than two elements.
     - The indices used in `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect. These should be `lst.remove(lst[0])` and `lst.remove(lst[1])` respectively.
     - The loop `for i in range(n * 2):` is unnecessary and incorrect. Instead, we should sort the list and pair the smallest elements to maximize the score.

4. **Sorting and Pairing:**
   - To achieve the optimal score, the correct approach is to sort the list and pair the smallest elements together.
   - This ensures that the sum of the minimums is maximized.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        score = 0
        while lst:
            x = lst.pop(0)
            if lst:
                y = lst.pop(0)
                score += min(x, y)
        ans_f.append(score)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Reading Input:**
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - Sorts the list of integers.
   - Initializes a variable `score` to 0.
   - Uses a while loop to repeatedly take the smallest two elements, add their minimum to the score, and remove them from the list until the list is empty.

3. **Output:**
   - Appends the final score to `ans_f` and prints each score at the end.

### Conclusion

The original program has logical errors in how it processes the list of integers. The corrected program uses a more efficient approach by sorting the list and pairing the smallest elements, ensuring the optimal score is achieved.
