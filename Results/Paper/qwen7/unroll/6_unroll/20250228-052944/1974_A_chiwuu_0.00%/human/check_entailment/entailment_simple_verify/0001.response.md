### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided examples.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, which represent the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The variable `t` is calculated as `b * 2` because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - If `t` is divisible by 5, it means the 2x2 icons can be perfectly placed without any extra space.
   - Otherwise, `t` is incremented by 1 to account for the remainder.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space After Placing 2x2 Icons:**
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This represents the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, it means there is enough space to place all 1x1 icons without needing additional screens.

4. **Handling Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - If there is not enough space (`t1 < a`), the program calculates how many more screens are needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, representing the number of 1x1 icons that need to be placed.
   - The number of additional screens needed is calculated as `t2 // 15` (integer division) plus 1 if there is a remainder.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The total number of screens required is printed for each test case.

### Detailed Verification

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples again:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `a = 1`, `b = 1`
   - `t = 2 * 1 = 2`, `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 1`
   - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`, which is greater than `a = 1`, so `t = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `a = 7`, `b = 2`
   - `t = 2 * 2 = 4`, `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 1`
   - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`, which is greater than `a = 7`, so `t = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `a = 12`, `b = 4`
   - `t = 2 * 4 = 8`, `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 2`
   - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 22`, which is greater than `a = 12`, so `t = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - `a = 0`, `b = 3`
   - `t = 2 * 3 = 6`, `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 2`
   - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 18`, which is greater than `a = 0`, so `t = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - `a = 1`, `b = 0`
   - `t = 2 * 0 = 0`, so `t = 0`
   - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`, which is less than `a = 1`, so `t2 = 1 - 0 = 1`
   - `t = 0 + 1 // 15 + 1 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - `a = 8`, `b = 1`
   - `t = 2 * 1 = 2`, `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 1`
   - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`, which is greater than `a = 8`, so `t = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - `a = 0`, `b = 0`
   - `t = 2 * 0 = 0`, so `t = 0`
   - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`, which is greater than `a = 0`, so `t = 0`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

8. **Test Case 8:**
   - `a = 2`, `b = 0`
   - `t = 2 * 0 = 0`, so `t = 0`
   - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`, which is less than `a = 2`, so `t2 = 2 - 0 = 2`
   - `t = 0 + 2 // 15 + 1 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

9. **Test Case 9:**
   - `a = 15`, `b = 0`
   - `t = 2 * 0 = 0`, so `t = 0`
   - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`, which is less than `a = 15`, so `t2 = 15 - 0 = 15`
   - `t = 0 + 15 // 15 + 1 = 2`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

10. **Test Case 10:**
    - `a = 8`, `b = 2`
    - `t = 2 * 2 = 4`, `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 1`
    - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`, which is less than `a = 8`, so `t2 = 8 - 7 = 1`
    - `t = 1 + 1 // 15 + 1 = 2`
    - Output: `2` (Correct)

11. **Test Case 11:**
    - `a = 0`, `b = 9`
    - `t = 2 * 9 = 18`, `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 4`
    - `t1 = 4 * 15 - 9 * 4 = 48`, which is greater than `a = 0`, so `t = 4`
    - Output: `5` (Correct)
