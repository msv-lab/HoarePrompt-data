Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - It calculates the number of screens needed just for the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, we need to calculate how many such icons fit into a single screen.
   - A 5x3 grid has 15 cells. Therefore, the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can fit in one screen is \( \left\lfloor \frac{15}{4} \right\rfloor = 3 \).
   - The formula `t = b * 2` seems incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Instead, it should be `t = (b * 4) // 15`. If there's a remainder, we need an additional screen, so `t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15`.

3. **Adjusting for Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - After calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons (`t`), it checks if the remaining space can accommodate all 1x1 icons.
   - The remaining space after placing 2x2 icons is calculated as `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then the current value of `t` is sufficient.
   - Otherwise, the remaining 1x1 icons need additional screens. The number of additional screens required is calculated as `t2 = (a - t1) // 15 + (1 if (a - t1) % 15 != 0 else 0)`.

### Corrected Program Logic

Here is the corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15  # Calculate screens needed for 2x2 icons
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4  # Remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        if t1 >= a:
            t += 0  # No additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        else:
            t2 = (a - t1) // 15 + (1 if (a - t1) % 15 != 0 else 0)  # Additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
            t += t2
        print(t)
```

### Verification

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1:** `1 1`
  - 2x2 icons: 1 (needs 1 screen)
  - Remaining space: 15 - 4 = 11
  - 1x1 icons: 1 (fits in the remaining space)
  - Total screens: 1

- **Test Case 2:** `7 2`
  - 2x2 icons: 2 (needs 1 screen)
  - Remaining space: 15 - 8 = 7
  - 1x1 icons: 7 (fits in the remaining space)
  - Total screens: 1

- **Test Case 3:** `12 4`
  - 2x2 icons: 1 (needs 1 screen)
  - Remaining space: 15 - 4 = 11
  - 1x1 icons: 12 (fits in the remaining space)
  - Total screens: 1

- **Test Case 4:** `0 3`
  - 2x2 icons: 0 (needs 0 screens)
  - Remaining space: 0
  - 1x1 icons: 0 (fits in the remaining space)
  - Total screens: 0

- **Test Case 5:** `1 0`
  - 2x2 icons: 0 (needs 0 screens)
  - Remaining space: 15
  - 1x1 icons: 1 (fits in the remaining space)
  - Total screens: 1

- **Test Case 6:** `8 1`
  - 2x2 icons: 1 (needs 1 screen)
  - Remaining space: 15 - 4 = 11
  - 1x1 icons: 8 (fits in the remaining space)
  - Total screens: 1

- **Test Case 7:** `0 0`
  - 2x2 icons: 0 (needs 0 screens)
  - Remaining space: 0
  - 1x1 icons: 0 (fits in the remaining space)
  - Total screens: 0

- **Test Case 8:** `2 0`
  - 2x2 icons: 0 (needs 0 screens)
  - Remaining space: 15
  - 1x1 icons: 2 (fits in the remaining space)
  - Total screens: 1

- **Test Case 9:** `15 0`
  - 2x2 icons: 0 (needs 0 screens)
  - Remaining space: 15
  - 1x1 icons: 15 (fits in the remaining space)
  - Total screens: 1

- **Test Case 10:** `8 2`
  - 2x2 icons: 2 (needs 1 screen)
  - Remaining space: 15 - 8 = 7
  - 1x1 icons: 8 (fits in the remaining space)
  - Total screens: 1

- **Test Case 11:** `0 9`
  - 2x2 icons: 0 (needs 0 screens)
  - Remaining space: 15
  - 1x1 icons: 9 (fits in the remaining space)
  - Total screens: 1

### Conclusion

The original program logic was incorrect due to the miscalculation of the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons. The corrected logic ensures the correct calculation and placement of icons. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
