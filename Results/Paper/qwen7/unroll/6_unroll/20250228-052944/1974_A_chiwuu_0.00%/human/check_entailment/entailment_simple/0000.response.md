Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case by reading `x` and `y` (the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively).

2. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons (`b`). Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, the total number of cells required for `b` icons is `b * 4`.
   - It then calculates how many full 5x3 grids (15 cells) are needed for these icons. This is done using `t = b * 2`, followed by checking if `t % 5 == 0` to see if an exact number of full grids is needed, or if an additional grid is required (`t // 5 + 1`).

3. **Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons**:
   - After calculating the space taken by 2x2 icons, the program checks if there is enough remaining space (15 cells per grid minus 4 cells used by each 2x2 icon) to fit the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates how many additional screens are needed to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons.

4. **Output**: The final value of `t` is printed, which represents the minimum number of screens needed.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:
- The calculation for the remaining space (`t1`) should account for the fact that each 1x1 icon takes up 1 cell, and the remaining space is `15 * t - b * 4`.
- The condition `if t1 >= a:` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the distribution of 1x1 icons across multiple screens. Instead, it should calculate the exact number of screens needed for both 2x2 and 1x1 icons combined.

Given these issues, the provided code does not accurately solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
