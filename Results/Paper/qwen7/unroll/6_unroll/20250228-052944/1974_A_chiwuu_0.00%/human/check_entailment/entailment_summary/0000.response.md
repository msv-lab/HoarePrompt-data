Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic implemented in the `func` function correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons based on the given constraints.

Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: The function reads the number of test cases, `n`, and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads two integers, `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
3. **Initial Calculation**: 
   - It calculates `t` as `b * 2` because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so `b * 2` gives the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
   - If `t % 5 == 0`, it means that the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons is exactly divisible by 5, so `t` is divided by 5.
   - Otherwise, `t` is divided by 5 and rounded up (using integer division).
4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This represents the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, it means there are enough cells to place all 1x1 icons without needing additional screens.
   - Otherwise, the remaining number of 1x1 icons (`a - t1`) needs to be placed in additional screens. The number of additional screens required is calculated by dividing the remaining number of 1x1 icons by 15 and rounding up (if there is any remainder).

However, the logic in the program seems to have some issues:

- The calculation of `t1` should be adjusted to account for the fact that each 1x1 icon takes up 1 cell, and the remaining cells should be checked against the number of 1x1 icons.
- The logic for calculating additional screens when `t1 < a` seems to be flawed. Specifically, the way `t2` is handled might not correctly account for the remaining cells and the number of 1x1 icons.

Given the example provided and the expected outputs, the program does not seem to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for all test cases. Therefore, the logic appears to be incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
