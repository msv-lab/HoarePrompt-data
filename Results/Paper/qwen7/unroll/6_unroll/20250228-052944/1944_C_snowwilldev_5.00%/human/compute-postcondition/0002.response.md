Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of N non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < N. The value of t is incremented for each unique element in the list a until either two unique elements are found or a zero is encountered. If two unique elements are found or a zero is encountered, the index of the first unique element is printed and the loop breaks. The output state describes the indices of the first unique elements for each test case or the first zero encountered, whichever comes first.
