Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly account for the bribing cost when moving Kirill to a position within the first `m` positions. 

The issue lies in how the variable `x` is being updated and used. The variable `x` accumulates the cost of bribing people between the current position and the start of the queue, but it does not correctly reflect the cost of bribing people who are already in positions less than `i`. Additionally, the logic to update `pergunta` does not correctly handle the scenario where Kirill needs to move to a position within the first `m` people.

Here is an example that highlights the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
2
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

The expected output should be `14`, but the program outputs `13`.

- For the first person (`i=0`), the cost to bribe them is `7`.
- For the second person (`i=1`), the cost to bribe them is `3`.
- For the third person (`i=2`), the cost to bribe them is `6`, and the accumulated cost `x` becomes `7 + 3 + 6 = 16`. Since `i < m`, we should consider the cost `a[2]` which is `6`, and the minimum cost is `min(16, 6) = 6`.
- For the fourth person (`i=3`), the cost to bribe them is `9`, and the accumulated cost `x` becomes `16 + 9 = 25`. Since `i < m`, we should consider the cost `a[3]` which is `9`, and the minimum cost is `min(25, 9) = 9`.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum cost without properly accounting for the cumulative cost of bribing people who are already in positions less than `i`.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly accumulate and update the cost of bribing people and ensure that the minimum cost is calculated properly for each position.
