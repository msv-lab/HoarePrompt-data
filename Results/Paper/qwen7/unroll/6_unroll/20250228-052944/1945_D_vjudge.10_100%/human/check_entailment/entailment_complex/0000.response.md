Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCasos`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m` are correctly initialized from the input.
3. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with the appropriate parameters, and the state before the function call is correctly described.
4. **Function Logic**:
   - The function iterates backward through the list `a` and updates `pergunta` based on the conditions specified in the problem statement.
   - It correctly accumulates the minimum values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` and updates `x` accordingly.
   - The function correctly identifies the minimum value of `pergunta` based on the cumulative sum and the condition `i < m`.
5. **Output**: The function prints the result, which is the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend.

Given the description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` matches the requirements of the problem statement. There are no logical errors or discrepancies noted in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
