Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.
2. The provided program defines a function `func_1` that iterates through the lists `a` and `b` in reverse order.
3. For each position `i` from `n-1` to `0`, the program updates `x` to be the cumulative sum of the minimum values between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
4. If `i < m`, it updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`.
5. The function then prints and returns the minimum value of `pergunta` after processing the entire list.

The logic in the program seems to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It iterates through the queue in reverse, calculating the cumulative cost and updating the minimum cost required for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions. This matches the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
