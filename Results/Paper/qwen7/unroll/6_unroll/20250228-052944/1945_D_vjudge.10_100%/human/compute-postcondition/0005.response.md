Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter pergunta (a string), two parameters a and b (both are lists of non-negative integers with length n), and two parameters n and m (positive integers where 1 <= m <= n). The function returns a value based on specific conditions involving the lists a and b and the integers n and m.**

This means the function takes a string and two lists of non-negative integers along with two positive integers as inputs. It then processes these inputs according to certain rules defined by the problem context but does not specify the exact nature of these rules here. The function ultimately returns a value determined by the given conditions.
