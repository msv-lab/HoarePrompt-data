Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the number of test cases (`numCasos`), and for each test case, it correctly reads `n`, `m`, the list `a`, and the list `b`.

2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with the appropriate parameters. The function is supposed to calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue.

3. **Loop and Conditions**:
   - The loop iterates backward from `n-1` to `0`.
   - For each index `i`, if `i < m`, it updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`.
   - It then adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`.

4. **Output**: The function prints the value of `pergunta`, which is the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people.

5. **Data Types**:
   - `pergunta` is initialized as `float('inf')`, ensuring it starts with an infinitely large value.
   - `a` and `b` are lists of integers.
   - `n` and `m` are integers.

6. **Algorithm Correctness**:
   - The algorithm correctly calculates the cumulative cost of moving Kirill to positions earlier in the queue while ensuring he ends up in one of the first `m` positions.
   - The logic of updating `pergunta` and `x` ensures that the minimum cost is found.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
