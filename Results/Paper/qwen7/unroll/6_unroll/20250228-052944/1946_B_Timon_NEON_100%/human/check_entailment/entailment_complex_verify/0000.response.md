### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the solution for the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations. Each operation allows selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. 

#### Given Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function simply returns the remainder of `number` when divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
   - This function is correctly implemented and used to ensure the result fits within the required modulo.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function aims to find the segment with the maximum sum in the array.
   - However, the logic in `func_2` is flawed. It attempts to track segments and their sums but does not account for the operations allowed in the problem statement. It only finds the maximum sum segment, which is insufficient to solve the problem.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function is completely empty and does not contain any logic to handle the operations or compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
   - This function is not implemented and does not contribute to solving the problem.

#### Key Issues:
- **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`:** The function `func_2` only finds the segment with the maximum sum, but it does not incorporate the operations allowed in the problem. The problem requires inserting the sum of any subarray into the array, which `func_2` does not do.
- **Missing Functionality in `func_3`:** The function `func_3` is entirely empty and does not address the core logic needed to solve the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the necessary logic to perform the required operations and maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations.
