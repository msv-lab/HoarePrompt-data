You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func_2(arr):
    new_segment = []
    max_segment = [0, 0]
    segments_variants = []
    max_sum = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if new_segment:
            if arr[i] < 0:
                if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                else:

                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            else:
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
                new_segment[0] += arr[i]

    #State: Output State: `max_sum` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray found in `arr`, `arr` is the list of integers provided, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the last segment considered before finding a new one with a potentially higher sum, `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that had the highest sum at some point during the loop's execution.
    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    total_max_segment = [-1]
    for segment in segments_variants:
        if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
            total_max_segment = segment
        
    #State: Output State: `max_sum` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray found in `arr`, `arr` is the list of integers provided, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the last segment considered before finding a new one with a potentially higher sum, `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that had the highest sum at some point during the loop's execution, and `segments_variants` now includes `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]; total_max_segment` is the segment with the maximum length among all segments in `segments_variants` that has the highest sum.
    return total_max_segment
    #`total_max_segment` which is the segment with the maximum length among all segments in `segments_variants` that has the highest sum
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `arr`, and returns the segment with the maximum length that has the highest sum among all possible segments.

```

Return Postconditions: `total_max_segment` which is the segment with the maximum length among all segments in `segments_variants` that has the highest sum


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
