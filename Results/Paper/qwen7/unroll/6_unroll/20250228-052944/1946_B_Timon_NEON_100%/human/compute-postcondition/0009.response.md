Output State: **`max_sum` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray found in `arr`, `arr` is the list of integers provided, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the last segment considered before finding a new one with a potentially higher sum, `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that had the highest sum at some point during the loop's execution, and `segments_variants` now includes `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` to `segments_variants`. Since `new_segment` is an empty list, the appended element is effectively `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`. This means that the last segment considered (`max_segment`) plus the index of the last element in `arr` (which is `len(arr) - 1`) is added to the list `segments_variants`. All other variables retain their previous values.
