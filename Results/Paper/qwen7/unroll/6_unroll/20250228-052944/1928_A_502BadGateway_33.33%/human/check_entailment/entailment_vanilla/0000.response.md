Let's analyze the given program step by step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` is called for each test case.
   - It checks if `b` is even using the condition `b % 2 == 0`.
   - If `b` is even, it returns `'yes'`.
   - If `b` is odd, it returns `'no'`.

3. **Output:**
   - The result of `func_1(a, b)` is printed for each test case.

### Problem Description Analysis:

- **Objective:** Determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
- **Key Points:**
  - A rectangle can always be cut into two smaller rectangles.
  - The resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
  - The key observation is whether the original rectangle can be split in such a way that the resulting pieces can form a new distinct rectangle.

### Key Observations:

- **Case 1: Both Dimensions are Even:**
  - If both `a` and `b` are even, the rectangle can be cut into four smaller rectangles of equal size, and these can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
  - Example: A 4x4 rectangle can be cut into four 2x2 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 2x8 rectangle.

- **Case 2: One Dimension is Even, the Other is Odd:**
  - If one dimension is even and the other is odd, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles where at least one dimension is even.
  - Example: A 4x3 rectangle can be cut into two 4x1.5 rectangles, but since we need integer dimensions, it can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 6x2 rectangle.

- **Case 3: Both Dimensions are Odd:**
  - If both dimensions are odd, the rectangle cannot be cut into smaller rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle.
  - Example: A 3x3 rectangle can only be cut into 1x3 rectangles, and these cannot be rearranged to form a new distinct rectangle.

### Conclusion:

The provided program only checks if `b` is even. However, the correct logic should consider both dimensions `a` and `b`. Specifically, the program should check if either `a` or `b` is even, as this ensures that the rectangle can be cut into smaller pieces that can form a new distinct rectangle.

### Correctness:

Given the analysis, the provided program is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even, missing the case where `a` is even. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
