Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(int(input()))`. The key variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The function `int(input())` reads an integer from the input. This integer will determine how many times the loop will run.

3. **Determine the range of `i`**: The loop will iterate from `0` to `int(input()) - 1`. Therefore, `i` will take values from `0` to `int(input()) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on the input integer, we need to ensure that the input integer is valid according to the constraints given. Specifically, the input integer should be within the range `1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4`.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that `i` will take values from `0` to `t - 1`, where `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4`.

**State:**
**`i` is 0, and `t` (the input integer) must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4.**
