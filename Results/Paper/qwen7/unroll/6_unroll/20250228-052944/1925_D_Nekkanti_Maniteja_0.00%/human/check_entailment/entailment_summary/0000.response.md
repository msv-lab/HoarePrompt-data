Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, followed by the parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case, and the friendship values `f_i` for each pair of friends.
2. **Modulo Constant**: The constant `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\), which is used throughout the calculations to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.
3. **Inverse Calculation**: The variable `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\). This is a necessary step for the subsequent calculations.
4. **Sum Initialization**: The variable `s` is initialized to 0, which will store the final sum of the expected friendship values.
5. **Friendship Value Sum**: The variable `a` accumulates the sum of all friendship values for the pairs of friends.
6. **Main Calculation Loop**: For each of the `k` excursions, the program updates `s` using the formula \(s = s + c \times i \times c \times m + c \times a\). This formula seems to be an attempt to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values, but let's verify it step-by-step:
   - \(c \times i \times c \times m\) might represent some kind of contribution from the pairs of friends being chosen.
   - \(c \times a\) might represent the initial sum of friendship values scaled by the inverse.
7. **Modulo Operation**: Finally, the result `s` is taken modulo \(M\) to ensure it fits within the required constraints.

However, the formula used in the main calculation loop does not seem to accurately represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the excursions. The correct approach should involve calculating the expected increase in friendship values for each excursion.

Given the provided example and the nature of the problem, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

Correctness: **False**
