Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the contribution of each friendship value to the expected sum.

The program attempts to use modular inverse (`c`) to somehow adjust the calculation, but this approach is fundamentally flawed. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Contribution**: The program tries to use `c * i * c * m` to calculate the contribution of each friendship value, which is not aligned with the problem statement. The expected value calculation should consider the probability of each pair being chosen and how the friendship value changes over excursions.

2. **Missing Probabilistic Consideration**: The program does not properly account for the probabilistic nature of choosing pairs. Each pair is chosen equiprobably and independently, and the expected value should reflect this.

3. **Incorrect Summation**: The program sums up the initial friendship values (`a`) and multiplies it by `c`, but this does not correctly represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values over k excursions.

A correct approach would involve calculating the expected increase in friendship value for each pair over k excursions and then summing these expectations. This requires understanding the probability of each pair being chosen and how the friendship value changes based on whether the pair is chosen or not.

Here's a brief outline of what the correct solution might look like:

1. Calculate the probability of each pair being chosen in a single excursion.
2. Calculate the expected increase in friendship value for each pair over k excursions.
3. Sum these expected values to get the final result.

Given the above points, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and thus is incorrect.
