You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers n, m, and k, along with additional integers representing pairs of friends and their associated values. It calculates a sum (s) based on specific formulas involving these inputs and a constant M (10^9 + 7). The final output for each test case is the value of s modulo M.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\). This is done using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - `s` is initialized to 0.
   - `a` is initialized to 0.
   - For each of the `m` pairs of friends, the program reads the indices `u`, `v`, and the friendship value `f`.
   - It adds the friendship value `f` to `a`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions.
   - It uses the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` to update `s` for each excursion.
   - Finally, it prints the result modulo \(M\).

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `c`:**
   - The value of `c` should be the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\).
   - However, the program calculates `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\), which is incorrect. It should be the inverse of the total number of possible pairs.

2. **Incorrect Formula for Expected Value:**
   - The formula used in the program `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions should be calculated differently. Specifically, the expected value for each pair of friends should be updated based on the probability of being chosen and the increase in friendship value.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair of friends and then sum these expected values.

1. **Calculate the Probability of Choosing Each Pair:**
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair in one excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).

2. **Update the Friendship Value:**
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value for each pair of friends can be calculated as the sum of the initial friendship value plus the expected increase due to subsequent excursions.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula and an incorrect calculation of the modular multiplicative inverse. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem.
