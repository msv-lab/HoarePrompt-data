Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by swapping digits between the two numbers to maximize their product. However, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. Specifically:

1. **Swapping Logic**: The function swaps digits such that for the first half of the string, each character in `x` becomes the maximum of the corresponding characters in the original `x` and `y`, and each character in `y` becomes the minimum of the corresponding characters in the original `x` and `y`. This is correct for the first half.
   
2. **Second Half Logic**: For the second half, it incorrectly sets each character in `x` to the minimum and each character in `y` to the maximum. This is the opposite of what should be done, which would minimize the product rather than maximize it.

To correctly maximize the product, the second half should follow the same logic as the first half but with the roles of `x` and `y` reversed.

Given this analysis, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the product.

Correctness: **False**
