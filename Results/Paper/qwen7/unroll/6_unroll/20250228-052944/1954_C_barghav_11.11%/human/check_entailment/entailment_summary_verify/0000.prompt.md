You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = m
            b[i] = n
        else:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = n
            b[i] = m
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
    print()
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function takes two strings `x` and `y` as input, where both strings consist of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length. It modifies these strings such that for the first half of the string, each character in `x` becomes the maximum of the corresponding characters in the original `x` and `y`, and each character in `y` becomes the minimum of the corresponding characters in the original `x` and `y`. For the second half of the string, this process is reversed: each character in `x` becomes the minimum of the corresponding characters in the original `x` and `y`, and each character in `y` becomes the maximum of the corresponding characters in the original `x` and `y`. After modifying the strings, the function prints the modified `x` and `y` strings. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the product of `x` and `y`. The current implementation simply swaps the smallest digit in `a` with the largest digit in `b` for the first half of the string and vice versa for the second half. This approach does not guarantee the maximum product because it does not consider the overall effect of the swaps on the product.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
123
456
```

The expected output would be:
```
623
154
```

or
```
523
164
```

However, the current program will produce:
```
423
156
```

or
```
523
146
```

In both cases, the product is not maximized. The correct approach would involve sorting the digits in descending order and then pairing the largest digits from `x` and `y` to form the new numbers `x` and `y` that maximize their product.
