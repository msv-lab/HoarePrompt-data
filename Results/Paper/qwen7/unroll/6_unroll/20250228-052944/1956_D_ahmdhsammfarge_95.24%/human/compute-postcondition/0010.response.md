Output State: **`ops` is a list containing `[n, n]`, `[n, r + 1]`, `[n, n]`, and `[n, r + 1]`; `n` is `l - r + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the slice `lst[r:l + 1]` with a list of `n` elements, where `n` is `l - r + 1`. Since the original `ops` list contains slices that overlap with `lst[r:l + 1]`, these slices are updated accordingly. The first and third slices remain unchanged because they refer to the same elements as the updated slice. The second and fourth slices are updated to reflect the new value of `n` and the updated starting index `r + 1`. The value of `n` remains `l - r + 1`.
