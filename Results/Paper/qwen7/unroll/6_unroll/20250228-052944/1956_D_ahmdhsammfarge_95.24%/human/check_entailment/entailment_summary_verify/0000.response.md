### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function attempts to find the subarray that, when modified, would result in the maximum sum. However, its logic is flawed. It calculates the sum of elements outside the subarray and adds the square of the subarray length to the sum, which is not relevant to finding the optimal subarray to modify. The correct approach would involve calculating the MEX of each subarray and then determining the best subarray to modify to maximize the sum.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function recursively appends operations to a list. While it does append operations, it doesn't seem to be used effectively to maximize the sum. The function `func_2` is called within `func_3`, but it doesn't appear to be doing any meaningful computation related to the MEX or the sum maximization.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function appends specific lists to `ops`, modifies `lst` by replacing the sublist from index `r` to `l` with a list of the same length filled with the value `l - r + 1`, and returns the modified `lst`. The function summary indicates that it appends specific lists to `ops` and modifies `lst` to a constant value. However, it does not ensure that the value chosen is the MEX of the subarray, which is crucial for maximizing the sum. The function `func_3` is designed to replace the subarray with a constant value, but it doesn't guarantee that this value is the MEX of the subarray.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the array elements through the allowed operations. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not follow the correct approach to solve the problem. Specifically, they do not ensure that the value chosen for the subarray modification is the MEX of the subarray, which is essential for maximizing the sum.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
