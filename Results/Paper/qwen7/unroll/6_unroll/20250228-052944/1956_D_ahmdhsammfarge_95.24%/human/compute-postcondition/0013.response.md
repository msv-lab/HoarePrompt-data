Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst` (a list of non-negative integers), and `ops` (a list for storing operations). It appends specific lists to `ops`, calls another function `func_2`, modifies `lst` by replacing the sublist from index `r` to `l` with a list of the same length filled with the value `l - r + 1`, and returns the modified `lst`. The final state of `ops` includes specific lists appended during the function's execution, and the returned list `lst` contains a series of identical values based on the length of the specified sublist.**
