Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Handling Odd `n`:**
   - The solution correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by printing "NO". However, it does not handle the case where `n` is even properly. It generates a string `s` with the pattern "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times, which will always result in a string with more than `n` special characters unless `n` is very small.

2. **Generating a Suitable String:**
   - For even `n`, the generated string "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times will have more than `n` special characters because each "A" in "AAB" is a special character, and there are more "A"s than needed.
   - A better approach would be to generate a string with exactly `n` special characters. One way to do this is to use a pattern like "AB" repeated `n` times, which ensures exactly `n` special characters.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) <= 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the string generated has exactly `n` special characters and does not exceed the length limit of 200.
