Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is odd correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is odd, the output should be 'NO'. However, the current implementation prints 'NO' only when `n % 2` is true, which is incorrect. For example, if `n = 3`, the program should output 'NO', but it currently outputs a string like 'AAABAACC', which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
