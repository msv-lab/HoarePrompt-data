Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
3. If `n` is odd, the function correctly prints 'NO' because an odd number of special characters cannot be formed with the pattern 'AAB' repeated `(n // 2)` times, which always results in an even number of characters.
4. If `n` is even, the function generates a string `s` using the pattern 'AAB' repeated `(n // 2)` times. This ensures that every character in the string, except the first and last, has exactly one neighbor that is different, making them special.
5. The function checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If the length exceeds 200, it prints 'NO', which is not possible since the maximum length of the string `s` when `n` is even is 198 (for `n = 100`), which is well within the limit.
6. The function handles all given constraints and examples correctly.

Correctness: **True**
