Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), the input must also satisfy this condition. Therefore, after executing the code, `t` is an integer input between 1 and 50, inclusive. The precondition that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\) is not affected by this code and remains valid, but since no assignment to `n` was made, its value is unchanged and not reflected in the output state.
