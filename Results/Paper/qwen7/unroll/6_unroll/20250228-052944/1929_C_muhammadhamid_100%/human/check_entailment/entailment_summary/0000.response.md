Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the `func` function matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Key Points from the Problem Statement:
1. **Initial Coins**: Sasha starts with \( a \) coins.
2. **Winning Multiplier**: If Sasha wins, his coins increase by \( y \cdot (k - 1) \).
3. **Losing Constraint**: Sasha cannot lose more than \( x \) times consecutively.
4. **Objective**: Determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins \( n \) through strategic betting.

### Analysis of the Given Code:
- The code iterates over the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \).
- It calculates \( s \) using the formula \( s = 1 \)
  - Then, it updates \( s \) in a loop for \( x \) iterations: 
    - \( s \) is updated to \( s + \frac{s}{k-1} + 1 \).

### Understanding the Calculation:
- The formula \( s = 1 \) and subsequent updates suggest an attempt to calculate the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can eventually reach any number of coins \( n \).
- The update rule \( s \leftarrow s + \frac{s}{k-1} + 1 \) seems to be an attempt to simulate the growth of Sasha's coins over a series of bets, considering the winning multiplier \( k \).

### Verification Against the Problem:
- The logic in the code aims to determine if Sasha can eventually have enough coins to cover any target \( n \).
- The calculation of \( s \) should reflect the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses the maximum allowed number of times \( x \) in a row before potentially winning.
- The final check \( a \geq s \) determines if Sasha's initial coins are sufficient to meet the worst-case scenario.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the code correctly checks if Sasha can achieve any number of coins \( n \) starting from \( a \) coins, considering the losing constraint \( x \) and the winning multiplier \( k \).

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
