State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6, `m` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^6**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0.
2. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer within the given range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
3. The variables `n` and `m` are not directly involved in the loop condition but are part of the loop head. They must be integers within the specified range (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6).

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
