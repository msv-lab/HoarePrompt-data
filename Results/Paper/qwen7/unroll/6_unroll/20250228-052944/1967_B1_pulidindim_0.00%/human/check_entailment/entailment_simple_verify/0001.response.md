### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified several issues with the provided program. Let's re-evaluate the program and the problem statement to confirm these findings.

#### Problem Statement Recap

We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Program Recap

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are read.
   - `count` is initialized to 2.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`.

2. **While Loop**:
   - The loop runs while `count` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
   - `g` is calculated as `n / count`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
   - `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1` to it.
   - `count` is incremented by 1.

#### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to incrementally add values to `ans` without correctly reflecting the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The logic inside the while loop does not correctly handle the gcd condition.

2. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The approach of incrementing `count` and adjusting `g` does not align with the required mathematical condition.
   - The program seems to be attempting to count something related to multiples but does not correctly implement the gcd condition.

#### Correct Approach

To correctly solve this problem, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly, ensuring accuracy.

### Final Evaluation

Since the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
