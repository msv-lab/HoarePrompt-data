Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6) are processed. The function returns a result based on the conditions given for n and m, ensuring the sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t`, followed by pairs of integers `n` and `m`. For each pair `(n, m)`, the function evaluates certain conditions and returns a result accordingly, ensuring the cumulative values of `n` and `m` do not exceed the specified limit.
