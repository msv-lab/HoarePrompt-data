Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Count Initialization**:
   - The variable `count` is initialized to 2.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This suggests an initial guess or starting point for the solution.

3. **While Loop**:
   - The loop runs while `count` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
     - `g` is calculated as `n / count`.
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
     - `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1` to it.
     - `count` is incremented by 1.

4. **Output**:
   - The final value of `ans` is printed after processing all test cases.

### Verification Against Problem Description

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The program does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.
   - The logic inside the while loop does not accurately reflect the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The approach of incrementing `count` and adjusting `g` does not align with the required mathematical condition.
   - The program seems to be attempting to count something related to multiples but does not correctly implement the gcd condition.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
