Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) but does not accurately calculate the number of such pairs according to the given conditions.

To illustrate, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement: `n = 10`, `m = 8`.

According to the problem description, we need to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's manually verify a few pairs:
- For \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\). Since \(2\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\). Since \(3\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 4\). Since \(4\) is a multiple of \(4\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 3\) and \(b = 1\): \(3 + 1 = 4\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(3, 1) = 1\). Since \(4\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 4\) and \(b = 1\): \(4 + 1 = 5\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(4, 1) = 1\). Since \(5\) is not a multiple of \(1\), this pair is not valid.
- For \(a = 5\) and \(b = 1\): \(5 + 1 = 6\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(5, 1) = 1\). Since \(6\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 6\) and \(b = 1\): \(6 + 1 = 7\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(6, 1) = 1\). Since \(7\) is not a multiple of \(1\), this pair is not valid.
- For \(a = 6\) and \(b = 2\): \(6 + 2 = 8\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(6, 2) = 4\). Since \(8\) is a multiple of \(4\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 6\) and \(b = 3\): \(6 + 3 = 9\) and \(3 \cdot \gcd(6, 3) = 9\). Since \(9\) is a multiple of \(9\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 7\) and \(b = 1\): \(7 + 1 = 8\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(7, 1) = 1\). Since \(8\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 8\) and \(b = 1\): \(8 + 1 = 9\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(8, 1) = 1\). Since \(9\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 9\) and \(b = 1\): \(9 + 1 = 10\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(9, 1) = 1\). Since \(10\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 10\) and \(b = 1\): \(10 + 1 = 11\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(10, 1) = 1\). Since \(11\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\): \(10 + 2 = 12\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(10, 2) = 4\). Since \(12\) is a multiple of \(4\), this pair is valid.

From the manual verification, we can see that the valid pairs are: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2), (10,3), (10,4), (10,5), (10,6), (10,7), (10,8). This gives us 21 valid pairs, which is not equal to the output of the program for this input.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
