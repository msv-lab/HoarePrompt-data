You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8

Output

    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are pairs of integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2⋅10^6 for each iteration of the loop, and `ans` is the accumulated result of the loop's computations for each `i` from 0 to `t-1`. After all iterations, the values of `n` and `m` for each iteration are processed to compute `ans` according to the given logic, and then printed as an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \) (with \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \)). It calculates and accumulates a result based on these inputs using a specific algorithm involving a while loop. Finally, it prints the computed result for each test case as an integer.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Count Initialization**:
   - The variable `count` is initialized to 2.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This suggests an initial guess or starting point for the solution.

3. **While Loop**:
   - The loop runs while `count` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
     - `g` is calculated as `n / count`.
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
     - `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1` to it.
     - `count` is incremented by 1.

4. **Output**:
   - The final value of `ans` is printed after processing all test cases.

### Verification Against Problem Description

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The program does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.
   - The logic inside the while loop does not accurately reflect the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The approach of incrementing `count` and adjusting `g` does not align with the required mathematical condition.
   - The program seems to be attempting to count something related to multiples but does not correctly implement the gcd condition.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
