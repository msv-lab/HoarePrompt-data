Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are pairs of integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2⋅10^6 for each iteration of the loop, and `ans` is the accumulated result of the loop's computations for each `i` from 0 to `t-1`. After all iterations, the values of `n` and `m` for each iteration are processed to compute `ans` according to the given logic, and then printed as an integer.
