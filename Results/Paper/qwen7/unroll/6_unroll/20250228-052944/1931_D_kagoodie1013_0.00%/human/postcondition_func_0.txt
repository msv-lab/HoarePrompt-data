The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case includes the size of an array, two integers (x and y), and the array elements. For each test case, it calculates the count of pairs (mod_x, mod_y) for each element in the array, with mod_x being -num % x and mod_y being num % y. It then appends these counts to a results list, which it returns.
