### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into individual components. This part is accurate.

2. **Test Case Parsing**:
   - The parsing of each test case, extracting `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`, is done correctly. This part is also accurate.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the number of beautiful pairs for each test case. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic used to determine the beautiful pairs.
   
   - The key issue lies in the calculation of `mod_x` as `-num % x`. This approach can lead to incorrect results because it does not always produce the expected modular result. Specifically, when `num % x` is close to `x`, `-num % x` might not yield the correct negative remainder. For example, if `x = 5` and `num = 4`, `-4 % 5` should be `1`, but the current implementation would incorrectly compute it as `1`.

   - The correct way to handle this is to use the formula `(-num) % x` directly, ensuring the result is within the range `[0, x-1]`. This can be achieved by using `(x - (num % x)) % x` when `num % x` is non-zero.

   - Additionally, the logic for checking the beautiful pairs is flawed. The current implementation uses `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` to count occurrences of `mod_x` and `mod_y`, but it does not correctly account for the conditions `a_i + a_j` being divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` being divisible by `y`.

   - The correct approach would involve iterating through the array and for each element, checking how many other elements satisfy both conditions simultaneously.

4. **Output**:
   - The output is printed in the required format, but due to the flaws in the logic, the results will be incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the logic used to determine the beautiful pairs is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly handle the modular arithmetic and does not accurately check the conditions for beautiful pairs.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
