Reasoning:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input correctly using `sys.stdin.read` and splits the data into manageable chunks for each test case. This ensures that the input is processed efficiently.

2. **Test Case Processing**: Each test case is processed in a loop where the necessary variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) are extracted and stored in a tuple. This is done correctly.

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program uses dictionaries (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to keep track of the occurrences of each modulo value for `x` and `y`.
   - For each number in the array, it calculates the modulo values `mod_x` and `mod_y` as required.
   - It then updates the counts in the respective dictionaries and adds the counts from both dictionaries to the current count of beautiful pairs.
   - Finally, it stores the count of beautiful pairs for each test case in the `results` list.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the results correctly by converting the list of counts to strings and joining them with newlines.

Given the logic and the implementation details, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
