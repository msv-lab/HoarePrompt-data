State: **`results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples containing four elements each (n, x, y, arr)**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop is defined as `for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:`. This means that the loop will iterate over each tuple in `test_cases`, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
2. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple. If `test_cases` is an empty list, the loop will not execute at all.
3. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are extracted from each tuple in `test_cases`. However, since we cannot predict the specific values of these variables within each tuple, we only need to ensure that `test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples with the correct structure.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `test_cases` must be a non-empty list of tuples, each containing four elements (n, x, y, arr).
