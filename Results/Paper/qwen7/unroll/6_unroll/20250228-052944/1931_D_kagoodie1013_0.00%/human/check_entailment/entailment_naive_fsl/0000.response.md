Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding beautiful pairs. Specifically, the program uses `mod_x = -num % x` which can lead to incorrect results because it does not handle negative numbers properly. For example, if `x = 5` and `num = 4`, `-num % x` would yield `1` instead of `4`. This can cause the program to miss valid beautiful pairs.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  6 5 2
  1 2 7 4 9 6
  ```

The expected output should be `2` because the pairs `<1, 5>` and `<4, 6>` are beautiful. However, due to the incorrect modulo calculation, the program might miss these pairs.

A corrected version of the program should use `(num - 1) % x + 1` to ensure the result is always non-negative. Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_x_map = {}
        mod_y_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = (num - 1) % x + 1
            mod_y = num % y
            count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
            mod_x_key = (num - 1) % x + 1
            mod_y_key = num % y
            mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
            mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

This corrected version ensures that the modulo operation handles negative numbers correctly, thus ensuring the program works as expected for all potential cases.
