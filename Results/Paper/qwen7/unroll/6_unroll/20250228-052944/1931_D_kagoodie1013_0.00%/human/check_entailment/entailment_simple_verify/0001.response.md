### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into individual components.
2. **Test Case Parsing**: It parses each test case correctly, extracting the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
3. **Function Call**: The parsed test cases are passed to the function `func_1` which is responsible for calculating the number of beautiful pairs.
4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes counters and maps (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to keep track of the counts of numbers modulo `x` and `y`.
   - It iterates through each number in the array, calculates its modulus with `x` and `y`, and updates the counts in the respective maps.
   - For each number, it checks how many previously seen numbers satisfy the conditions for being a "beautiful pair" and increments the count accordingly.
   - Finally, it appends the count to the `results` list and returns the list after processing all test cases.

However, there is a critical issue in the calculation of the modulus for `mod_x`. The line `mod_x = -num % x` is problematic because it does not handle negative numbers correctly. Specifically, when `num` is negative, `-num % x` will not yield the correct result for finding pairs where `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.

To fix this, we should use the standard modulus operation `num % x` directly, ensuring that the result is always non-negative. This way, we can correctly count the pairs where `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_x_map = {}
        mod_y_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
            mod_x_key = num % x
            mod_y_key = num % y
            mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
            mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment incorrectly assumed that the current implementation would work correctly for all cases, including negative numbers. After reviewing the code and the annotated version, it is clear that the current implementation has a flaw in the calculation of `mod_x`.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
