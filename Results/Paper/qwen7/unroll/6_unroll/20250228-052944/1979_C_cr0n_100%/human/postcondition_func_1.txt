The function reads two lines of input: the first line contains an integer \(N\) representing the number of elements in the list, and the second line contains \(N\) integers. It then calculates a value `den` by successively applying a function `func_1` to the first element of the list and each subsequent element. After that, it computes a list `vprod` where each element is the result of `den` divided by each corresponding element in the original list. It updates `den` by subtracting the sum of `vprod`. If `den` becomes less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1` and returns. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string and returns `None`.
