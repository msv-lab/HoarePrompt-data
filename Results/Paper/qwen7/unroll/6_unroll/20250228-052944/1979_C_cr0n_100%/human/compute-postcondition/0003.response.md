Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in vals:`. The objects involved here are `x` and `vals`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `vals` is a list of `N` integers where each integer \( k_i \) is between 2 and 20.
   - `den` is the first element of `vals`.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in `vals`.
   - In the first iteration, `x` will be set to the first element of `vals`, which is `den`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will start with the first element of `vals`, `x` will be `den` in the first iteration.
   - For the loop to execute, `vals` must contain at least one element (which it does since `N` is an input integer and `vals` is a list of `N` integers).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `x` should be equal to the first element of `vals`, which is `den`.
- `vals` must contain at least one element.

So, the final state is:
**`x` is `den`, `vals` is a list of `N` integers where each integer \( k_i \) is between 2 and 20**.
