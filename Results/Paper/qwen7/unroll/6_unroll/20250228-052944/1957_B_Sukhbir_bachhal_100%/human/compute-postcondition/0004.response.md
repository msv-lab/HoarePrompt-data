The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero.

Right before the loop, `position` is 0, and `n` is an integer. The value of `position` does not affect the condition of the loop, so no adjustment is needed for `position`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted for `n` to be non-zero.

State: **`position` is 0, `n` must be non-zero**
