You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). For each test case, it determines whether the sequence \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) represents a 'STAIR' (if \(a < b < c\)), a 'PEAK' (if \(a < b\) and \(b > c\)), or neither ('NONE'). It then prints the corresponding label for each test case. The function does not return any value and leaves the input variables unchanged after its execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Reading Test Case Input**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
   - It then checks if `a < b` and `b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it prints 'NONE'.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` as per the problem statement.
   - It correctly identifies when the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither.

Given that the program follows the logic specified in the problem description accurately and handles all edge cases appropriately, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
