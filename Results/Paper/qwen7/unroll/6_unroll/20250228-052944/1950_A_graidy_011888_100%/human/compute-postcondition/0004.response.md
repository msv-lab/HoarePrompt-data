Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints and the provided output cases, it appears there might be a misunderstanding since the function definition does not include any parameters. Based on the format and the example given, the function does not seem to process any input parameters but rather might handle some internal logic or possibly process data from external sources not shown in the provided snippet. However, strictly following the format and the information provided, the function does not accept any parameters and hence does not return anything.
