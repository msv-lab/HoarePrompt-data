Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a list a containing n integers (where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It returns a result based on the given test case parameters.**

This means the function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t` indicating the number of subsequent test cases, an integer `n` indicating the size of the list `a`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes each test case according to the provided constraints and returns a result for each.
