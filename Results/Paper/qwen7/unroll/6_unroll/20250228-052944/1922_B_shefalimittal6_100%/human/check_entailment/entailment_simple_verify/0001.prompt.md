You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`.
   - It splits the input into a list of strings.
   - It uses an index `idx` to keep track of the current position in the list.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts the value of `n` (number of sticks).
   - It initializes an array `v` of size `n+1` to count occurrences of each stick length.
   - It iterates through the list of stick lengths and updates the count in the array `v`.

3. **Calculating the Number of Valid Triangles:**
   - It uses a variable `cnt` to keep track of the cumulative count of sticks.
   - For each stick length `i`, it checks if there are at least 2 sticks of the same length (`v[i] >= 2`) and calculates the number of ways to choose 2 such sticks.
   - Similarly, it checks if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length (`v[i] >= 3`) and calculates the number of ways to choose 3 such sticks.
   - It adds these counts to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - It stores the result for each test case in the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, let's consider the examples provided in the problem statement:

#### Example 1:
- **Input:**
  ```
  4
  7
  1 1 1 1 1 1 1
  4
  3 2 1 3
  3
  1 2 3
  1
  1
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  35
  2
  0
  0
  ```

#### Analysis:
1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `n = 7`
   - Stick lengths: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Any combination of 3 sticks forms a degenerate triangle (area = 0), but we need non-degenerate triangles (area > 0). Since all sticks are of the same length, no valid triangle can be formed.
   - **Result:** 0 (but the expected output is 35, which seems incorrect based on the problem statement)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `n = 4`
   - Stick lengths: `[3, 2, 1, 3]`
   - Possible combinations forming non-degenerate triangles:
     - (3, 2, 1) and (3, 3, 2)
   - **Result:** 2 (matches the expected output)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `n = 3`
   - Stick lengths: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - No combination of 3 sticks forms a non-degenerate triangle.
   - **Result:** 0 (matches the expected output)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - `n = 1`
   - Stick lengths: `[1]`
   - No combination of 3 sticks can be formed.
   - **Result:** 0 (matches the expected output)

### Conclusion

The program logic seems to be flawed in the first test case. The expected output of 35 suggests that the program might be counting degenerate triangles as well, which is not allowed according to the problem statement.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it counts degenerate triangles (where the area is zero) as valid triangles, which contradicts the problem statement.
