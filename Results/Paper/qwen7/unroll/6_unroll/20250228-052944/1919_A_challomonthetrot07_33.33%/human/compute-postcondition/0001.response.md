Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `T` used in the `range()` function.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `T`. Therefore, the value of `T` directly influences whether the loop will run or not.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state given is that `T` is an input integer and it is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, `T` must be a positive integer within the specified range. The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration. For the loop to execute at least once, `T` must be at least 1.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `T` must be at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`T` must be at least 1**
