You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

    1000000000 1000000000
    
    53110 2024

Output

    Bob
    Alice

    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

    #State: Output State: The output will consist of T lines, each line containing either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. The specific output on each line depends on the values of `a` and `b` provided by the user for each iteration of the loop. If `a` equals `b`, it prints 'Bob'. If `a` is 1, it prints 'Alice'. If `b` is 1, it prints 'Bob'. If `a` is odd, it prints 'Bob'. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, it prints 'Alice'. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints 'Bob', otherwise it prints 'Alice'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 1000 test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). Based on the values of \(a\) and \(b\), it outputs either 'Alice' or 'Bob' for each test case. Specifically, if \(a\) equals \(b\), it outputs 'Bob'. If \(a\) is 1, it outputs 'Alice'. If \(b\) is 1, it outputs 'Bob'. If \(a\) is odd, it outputs 'Bob'. If \(a\) is even and \(b\) is odd, it outputs 'Alice'. If \(a\) is greater than \(b\), it outputs 'Bob', otherwise it outputs 'Alice'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider the optimal strategy for both players when \(a\) and \(b\) are not equal and both are greater than 1. Let's analyze a counterexample:

Consider the test case \(a = 2\) and \(b = 3\):

1. Alice starts with \(a = 2\) and \(b = 3\).
2. Alice can either swap wallets or not. If she swaps, \(a = 3\) and \(b = 2\). If she doesn't swap, \(a = 1\) and \(b = 3\).

- If Alice swaps, \(a = 3\) and \(b = 2\):
  - Bob can either swap or not. If he swaps, \(a = 2\) and \(b = 3\), which brings us back to the initial state but with Bob's turn. If he doesn't swap, \(a = 3\) and \(b = 1\).
  - If Bob swaps, \(a = 2\) and \(b = 3\):
    - Alice can either swap or not. If she swaps, \(a = 3\) and \(b = 2\), which again brings us back to the initial state but with Alice's turn. If she doesn't swap, \(a = 1\) and \(b = 3\).
  - If Bob doesn't swap, \(a = 3\) and \(b = 1\):
    - Alice can only swap, resulting in \(a = 1\) and \(b = 2\).
    - Bob can only swap, resulting in \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\).
    - Alice can only swap, resulting in \(a = 1\) and \(b = 2\).
    - Bob can only swap, resulting in \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\).
    - This cycle continues until one of them runs out of coins.

Given the above analysis, the program incorrectly determines the winner for certain cases. For instance, for \(a = 2\) and \(b = 3\), the program would incorrectly predict a winner based on simple parity checks rather than the optimal strategy. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
