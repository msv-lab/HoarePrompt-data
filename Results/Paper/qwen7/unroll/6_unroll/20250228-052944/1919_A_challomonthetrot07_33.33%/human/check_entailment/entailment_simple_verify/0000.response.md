### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- Both players take turns removing 1 coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
- The goal is to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Parity of Coins**: The outcome often depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of coins each player has.
2. **Swapping Wallets**: Swapping wallets does not change the total number of coins but can affect the game state.
3. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy involves understanding the parity and the relative number of coins.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program uses several conditions to determine the winner based on the values of `a` and `b`.
- It does not fully capture the optimal strategy for all cases.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Case \(a = b\)**:
   - The program correctly prints 'Bob'.
   
2. **Case \(a = 1\)**:
   - The program correctly prints 'Alice'.
   
3. **Case \(b = 1\)**:
   - The program correctly prints 'Bob'.
   
4. **Case \(a \% 2 == 1\)**:
   - The program prints 'Bob'.
   - This condition is correct because if `a` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by swapping and then reducing `a` to an even number.
   
5. **Case \(a \% 2 == 0\) and \(b \% 2 == 1\)**:
   - The program prints 'Alice'.
   - This condition is correct because if `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by swapping and then reducing `b` to an even number.
   
6. **Case \(a > b\)**:
   - The program prints 'Bob'.
   - This condition is incorrect. Consider the case \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\):
     - If Alice swaps, \(a = 1\) and \(b = 2\).
     - If Bob swaps, \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\).
     - Alice can now swap again, forcing Bob to lose.
   - The program should handle this case more carefully.
   
7. **Default Case**:
   - The program prints 'Alice'.
   - This condition is incorrect. Consider the case \(a = 3\) and \(b = 2\):
     - If Alice swaps, \(a = 2\) and \(b = 3\).
     - If Bob swaps, \(a = 3\) and \(b = 2\).
     - Alice can now swap again, forcing Bob to lose.
   - The program should handle this case more carefully.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly those where the relative parity and number of coins need to be considered more deeply. The provided counterexamples show that the program makes incorrect predictions for certain inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is not correct for all potential cases.
