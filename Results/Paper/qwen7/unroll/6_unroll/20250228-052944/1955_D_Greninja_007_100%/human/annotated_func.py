#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, a is a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, and b is a list of m integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.

    return ans
    #The program returns ans which is set to the number of times sm reached or exceeded k during the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integers n, m, and k along with two lists a and b. It returns the count of times the sum of the minimum occurrences of elements present in both lists a and b up to index m-1 reaches or exceeds k during a sliding window operation over list a.
