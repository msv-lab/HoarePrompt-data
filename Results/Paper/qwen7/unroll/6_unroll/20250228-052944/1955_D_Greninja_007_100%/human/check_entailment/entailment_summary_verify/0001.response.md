### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) for each test case.
   - It then reads the arrays \( a \) and \( b \) for each test case.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to calculate the number of good subsegments of array \( a \) of length \( m \) that contain at least \( k \) elements from array \( b \).

3. **Counter Initialization**:
   - `cb` is initialized as a counter for the sorted elements of array \( b \).
   - `ca` is initialized as a counter for the sorted elements of the first \( m \) elements of array \( a \).

4. **Initial Good Subsegment Check**:
   - The initial segment of \( a \) of length \( m \) is checked to see if it contains at least \( k \) elements from \( b \). This is done using the intersection of counters (`ca & cb`) and checking the sum of the values in this intersection.

5. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsequent subsegment of \( a \) of length \( m \).
   - For each new element added to the window (element \( a[r] \)), it increments the corresponding count in `ca`.
   - For each element removed from the window (element \( a[r - m] \)), it decrements the corresponding count in `ca`.
   - It updates the sum of matching elements (`sm`) accordingly.
   - If the updated sum of matching elements (`sm`) is at least \( k \), it increments the answer (`ans`).

6. **Output**:
   - The function returns the total count of good subsegments for each test case.

However, there is a critical issue with the logic used in the sliding window approach. Specifically, the counters `ca` and `cb` are being sorted, which means they are not maintaining the original order of elements in \( a \) and \( b \). This can lead to incorrect results because the problem requires the elements to be in the same relative order as in the original arrays.

### Example to Illustrate the Issue:

Consider the following example:
- \( a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] \)
- \( b = [1, 2, 3, 4] \)
- \( k = 3 \)

If we use the sliding window approach without sorting, the initial segment `[1, 2, 3, 4]` would be considered good because it matches all elements of \( b \). However, if we sort the counters, the initial segment might not be considered good because the order of elements is lost.

### Corrected Approach:

To fix this, we should not sort the counters. Instead, we should directly compare the counts of elements in the current window with the counts in \( b \).

### Corrected Code:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(b)
    ca = Counter(a[:m])
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1
    for r in range(m, n):
        if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm -= 1
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
    return ans

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was **inaccurate** because the counters were sorted, leading to incorrect results. The corrected approach maintains the order of elements, ensuring the program works as intended.

**Final: False**
