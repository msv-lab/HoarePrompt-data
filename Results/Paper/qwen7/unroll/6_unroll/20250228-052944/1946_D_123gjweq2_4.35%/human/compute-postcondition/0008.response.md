Output State: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers representing a subarray of the original array `a`, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (starting from the most significant bit to the least significant bit), `x` is an integer representing the favorite number of Yarik, `new_arr` is a list containing elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of subarrays of `cur_arr` whose XOR value in the current bit position is 0, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0.
