You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers representing a subarray of the original array a, bit is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (starting from the most significant bit to the least significant bit), and x is an integer representing the favorite number of Yarik.
def find_max(cur_arr, bit):
    if (bit == -1) :
        return len(cur_arr)
        #The program returns the length of the list 'cur_arr'
    #State: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers representing a subarray of the original array a, bit is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (starting from the most significant bit to the least significant bit), and x is an integer representing the favorite number of Yarik. The value of bit is not -1.
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
        
    #State: Output State: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers representing a subarray of the original array `a`, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (starting from the most significant bit to the least significant bit), `x` is an integer representing the favorite number of Yarik, `new_arr` is a list containing elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of subarrays of `cur_arr` whose XOR value in the current bit position is 0, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0.
    if (xor >> bit & 1) :
        thing1 = -1
    else :
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    #State: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers representing a subarray of the original array `a`, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered, `x` is an integer representing the favorite number of Yarik, `new_arr` is a list containing elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of subarrays of `cur_arr` whose XOR value in the current bit position matches the value of the current bit of `xor`, `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is either -1 or the result of the function `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` depending on whether the current bit of `xor` is 1 or 0.
    if (x >> bit & 1) :
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
        #The program returns the maximum value between the result of find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1) and the length of new_arr.
    else :
        return thing1
        #The program returns either -1 or the result of the function find_max(new_arr, bit - 1) depending on whether the current bit of xor is 0 or 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: cur_arr, a list of non-negative integers, and bit, an integer representing the current bit position. It returns the length of the list 'cur_arr' if the current bit is 0. Otherwise, it returns either -1 or the maximum value between the result of find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1) and the length of new_arr, depending on whether the current bit of the XOR operation is 1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the length of the list 'cur_arr'

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value between the result of find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1) and the length of new_arr.

Case_3: The program returns either -1 or the result of the function find_max(new_arr, bit - 1) depending on whether the current bit of xor is 0 or 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
