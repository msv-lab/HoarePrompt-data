Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers representing a subarray of the original array `a`, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (starting from the most significant bit to the least significant bit), and `x` is an integer representing the favorite number of Yarik; `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `xor` to 0. This does not affect the values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, `x`, or `new_arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
