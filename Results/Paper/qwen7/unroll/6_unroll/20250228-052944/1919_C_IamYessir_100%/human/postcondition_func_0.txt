The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it divides the list into two sublists \( a \) and \( b \) based on certain conditions. It then counts the number of increasing subsequences in both \( a \) and \( b \), and prints the total count. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
