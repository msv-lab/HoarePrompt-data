Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Logic for Splitting Arrays**: The logic for deciding which elements go into `a` and `b` is flawed. The current implementation does not ensure that the penalties for both arrays are minimized correctly. Specifically, the conditions for appending elements to `a` or `b` do not always lead to the optimal split.

2. **Handling of Equal Values**: When `x == y`, the code appends the element to `a`. However, this may not always result in the minimum penalty. The correct approach would be to consider the relative order of the elements and their positions to minimize the penalty.

3. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty calculation part seems correct, but the way elements are being split might not yield the optimal result.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to sort the array and then split it into two parts such that the sum of increasing subsequences in both parts is minimized. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the array
        lit.sort()
        
        # Initialize penalties for both subsequences
        p_s = 0
        p_t = 0
        
        # Split the array into two subsequences
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if lit[i] < lit[i + 1]:
                p_s += 1
            else:
                p_t += 1
        
        # The total penalty is the sum of penalties of both subsequences
        print(p_s + p_t)

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting the array ensures that any increasing subsequence is naturally formed.
2. **Split the Array**: Iterate through the sorted array and count the number of times an element is less than the next element, which gives the penalty for one subsequence. The other subsequence's penalty is implicitly calculated by the remaining elements.

This approach ensures that the penalty is minimized by leveraging the natural order of the sorted array.
