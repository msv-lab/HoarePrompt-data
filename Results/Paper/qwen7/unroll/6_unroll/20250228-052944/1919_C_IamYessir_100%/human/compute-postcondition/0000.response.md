Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the loop to iterate over the input. It is typically not named explicitly but is used to indicate the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute based on the input from `input()`. Specifically, the loop will run as many times as there are lines of input provided by the user.

3. **Initial State Provided**: The initial state provided is that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Each test case consists of an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and a list of `n` integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\). The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop runs based on the input, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input itself. The loop will continue to execute until the input is exhausted. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that the input provides enough data for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input itself. The loop will execute for each line of input provided by the user, up to `t` lines.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- The input must provide `t` lines of data, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the input must provide `t` lines of data, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers**.
