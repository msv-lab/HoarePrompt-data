Reasoning:
1. The problem requires moving chips to form a single block without any free cells between them, minimizing the number of operations.
2. The provided code removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a`, which effectively groups all chips together and counts the number of free cells (zeros) between them.
3. The number of operations required to move all chips to form a single block is equal to the number of free cells (zeros) between the chips because each free cell needs to be filled by a chip moved from its current position.
4. The logic in the code correctly implements this approach by counting the zeros in the list `a` after removing leading and trailing zeros.
5. The output is the count of these zeros, which matches the requirement of the problem.

Given the above points, the code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
