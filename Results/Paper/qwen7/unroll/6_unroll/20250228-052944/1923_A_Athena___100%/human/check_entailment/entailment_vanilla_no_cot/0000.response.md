Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the solution does not account for moving chips to the closest free cell to the left. Instead, it removes leading and trailing zeros and counts the number of zeros in the remaining list, which does not necessarily give the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to focus on moving each chip to the left until no more moves can be made, counting the moves as we go. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        
        # Find the index of the rightmost chip
        rightmost_chip_index = None
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            if a[i] == 1:
                rightmost_chip_index = i
                break
        
        # Move each chip to the closest free cell to the left
        for i in range(rightmost_chip_index + 1):
            if a[i] == 1:
                # Find the closest free cell to the left
                j = i - 1
                while j >= 0 and a[j] == 1:
                    j -= 1
                if j < 0:
                    continue
                else:
                    # Move the chip to the closest free cell
                    res += i - j - 1
                    # Update the position of the chip
                    a[j+1] = 1
                    a[i] = 0
        
        print(res)

func()
```

This solution correctly simulates the process of moving each chip to the closest free cell to the left and counts the number of moves required to form a single block of chips.
