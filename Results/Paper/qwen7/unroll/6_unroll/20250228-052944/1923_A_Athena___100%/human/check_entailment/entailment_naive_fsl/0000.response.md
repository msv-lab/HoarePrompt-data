Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. The program removes leading and trailing zeros and counts the number of zeros remaining, which does not account for the actual minimum number of moves needed.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```

The correct output should be `1` because moving the chip in the 7th cell to the 5th cell achieves the goal. However, the program will incorrectly output `0` because it only counts the number of zeros after removing leading and trailing zeros.

Another example where the program fails:
```
5
4
1 0 1 0
```

The correct output should be `2` because we need to move both chips to form a single block. However, the program will incorrectly output `1`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
