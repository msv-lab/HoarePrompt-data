Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) indicating the number of test cases, followed by an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n integers representing the number of pages in each book (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it sorts the list of page numbers in descending order and prints the sum of the two largest page numbers. After processing all test cases, it returns nothing.**
