You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    4
    
    2 3 3 1
    
    5
    
    2 2 3 2 2
    
    2
    
    10 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 represents the number of pages in each book.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now set to the integer input value; no other variables are defined or changed. The program prints the sum of the two largest numbers from each input list of integers, for a total of t times. No other variables are affected.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) indicating the number of test cases, followed by an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n integers representing the number of pages in each book (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it sorts the list of page numbers in descending order and prints the sum of the two largest page numbers. After processing all test cases, it returns nothing.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of page counts `nums`.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The list `nums` is sorted in descending order using `nums.sort(reverse=True)`.

3. **Selecting Books:**
   - After sorting, the program prints the sum of the first two elements in the sorted list (`nums[0] + nums[1]`).

### Reasoning

- The goal is to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages from each pile.
- By sorting the list in descending order, we ensure that the largest values are at the beginning of the list.
- Selecting the first two elements after sorting gives us the two largest values, which represent the books with the highest page counts in their respective piles.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through an example to verify this logic:

#### Example 1:
- Input:
  ```
  2
  4
  2 3 3 1
  ```

- Steps:
  - Sort the list `[2, 3, 3, 1]` to get `[3, 3, 2, 1]`.
  - The first two elements are `3` and `3`.
  - Sum: `3 + 3 = 6`.

However, the expected output for this example is `4`, not `6`. This indicates a mistake in our initial analysis.

### Correct Approach

To achieve the correct result, we need to ensure that the largest possible value is paired with the second-largest value across both piles. The correct approach would be to split the list into two parts and find the maximum sum of the largest values from each part.

### Corrected Program

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        max_pages = 0
        for i in range(n // 2):
            max_pages += nums[i]
        for i in range(n // 2, n):
            max_pages += nums[i]
        print(max_pages)
```

### Conclusion

The original program incorrectly sums only the first two elements after sorting. The corrected program should iterate through the list and sum the largest values appropriately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
