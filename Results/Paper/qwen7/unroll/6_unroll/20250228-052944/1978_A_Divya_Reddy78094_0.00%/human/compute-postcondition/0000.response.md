Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now set to the integer input value; no other variables are defined or changed.**

This means that the initial state's condition for `t` remains the same, and now `t` has been updated to the integer value entered by the user. No other variables (`n`, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`) are defined or changed yet.
