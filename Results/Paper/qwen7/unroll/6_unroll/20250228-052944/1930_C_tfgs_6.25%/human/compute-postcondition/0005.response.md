Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in list `a`; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of integers where each element a[i] is initially a[i] + (i + 1) for 0 ≤ i < n; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5.**

The code `counter = Counter(a)` creates a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
