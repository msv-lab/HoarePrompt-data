Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a predefined list of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a specific value based on the given conditions.**

This means the function processes a series of predefined test cases, each containing an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function then performs operations based on these inputs and returns a result for each test case.
