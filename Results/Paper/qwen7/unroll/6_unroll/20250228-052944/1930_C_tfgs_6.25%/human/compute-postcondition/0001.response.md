Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, a is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `n` is not affected by this code.
