You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: Output State: The output will consist of multiple lines, each representing the result of one test case. For each test case, the output will contain pairs of integers printed on separate lines, where each pair represents two occurrences of the same integer from the array `a`. The pairs are printed in the order they appear in the array `a`, and the process stops once `k` pairs have been printed or when there are no more pairs left to print. Any remaining integers that were not printed as pairs will be listed at the end of the line. If the counts of pairs found in the first half (`l`) and the second half (`r`) of the array do not match, the script will continue to print pairs from the second half until the counts match.
    #
    #In simpler terms, the output will show pairs of identical numbers from the array `a` as specified by `k`, and any leftover numbers that couldn't form pairs will be listed at the end.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, along with two integers n and k. It prints pairs of identical numbers from the array `a` as specified by `k`, and any leftover numbers that couldn't form pairs are listed at the end. If the counts of pairs found in the first half and the second half of the array do not match, it continues to print pairs from the second half until the counts match.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Arrays `l` and `r` are initialized with zeros.
   - Variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are initialized to zero.
   - An empty list `res` is created to store elements that will be used for `r`.

3. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of each element in the first half of the array (`a[0:n]`) and stores these counts in `l`.
   - Similarly, it counts the occurrences of each element in the second half of the array (`a[n:2n]`) and stores these counts in `r`.

4. **Constructing `l`:**
   - The program tries to fill `l` with pairs of elements where each element appears exactly twice in `a`.
   - It prints pairs of elements from `a` where the count in `l` is 2, reducing the count to 0 after use.
   - If it successfully fills `l` with `2k` elements, it breaks out of the loop.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements for `l`:**
   - If it doesn't fill `l` with `2k` elements, it tries to fill the remaining positions in `l` with single occurrences from `a`.

6. **Constructing `r`:**
   - After constructing `l`, the program constructs `r` using the same logic as for `l`, ensuring that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed arrays `l` and `r`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing `l` and `r`:**
   - The program attempts to construct `l` and `r` by directly printing pairs and single elements from `a` without ensuring that the XOR condition is met.
   - This approach does not guarantee that the XOR of elements in `l` will equal the XOR of elements in `r`.

2. **Incomplete Handling of Remaining Elements:**
   - The program does not ensure that the remaining elements in `l` and `r` are chosen such that their XOR values match.
   - It simply prints the remaining elements without considering the XOR condition.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
