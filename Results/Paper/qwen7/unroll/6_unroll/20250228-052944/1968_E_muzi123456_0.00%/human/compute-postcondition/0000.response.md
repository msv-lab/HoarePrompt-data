Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive; `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, inclusive**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 50`, the value of `t` remains within this range after the assignment. Similarly, the initial state also mentions that for each test case, `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3`, but the code snippet does not affect `n`, so its state remains unchanged.
