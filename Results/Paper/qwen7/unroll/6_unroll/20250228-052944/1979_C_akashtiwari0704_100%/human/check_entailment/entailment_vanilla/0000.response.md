Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- You need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes.
- For each outcome \( i \), you bet \( x_i \) coins.
- If the \( i \)-th outcome wins, you get back \( k_i \times x_i \) coins.
- The total amount of coins bet must be strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

### Given Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a`.

2. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The function `lcm` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the list `a`.
   - This LCM is used to ensure that the sum of the bets is minimized while still being able to cover the required conditions.

3. **Bet Calculation:**
   - For each outcome \( i \), the program calculates \( a[i] = \text{lcm}(a) / a[i] \).
   - This ensures that the total sum of the bets is minimized but still covers the required condition.

4. **Sum of Bets:**
   - The program calculates the total sum of the bets `sumo`.
   - If `sumo` is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets.

### Correctness Check:
- **Edge Cases:**
  - If all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same, the LCM calculation will be straightforward.
  - If the LCM is too large, the sum of the bets might still be greater than the smallest multiplier, leading to an incorrect result.
  - The program should handle cases where the LCM is not sufficient to cover all multipliers.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1:** 
  - `n = 3`, `k = [3, 2, 7]`
  - LCM of `[3, 2, 7]` is `42`.
  - Bets: `42/3 = 14`, `42/2 = 21`, `42/7 = 6`.
  - Sum: `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`.
  - Since `41 < 42`, it prints the bets correctly.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `n = 2`, `k = [3, 3]`
  - LCM of `[3, 3]` is `3`.
  - Bets: `3/3 = 1`, `3/3 = 1`.
  - Sum: `1 + 1 = 2`.
  - Since `2 < 3`, it prints the bets correctly.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `n = 5`, `k = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
  - LCM of `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]` is `5`.
  - Bets: `5/5 = 1`, `5/5 = 1`, `5/5 = 1`, `5/5 = 1`, `5/5 = 1`.
  - Sum: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`.
  - Since `5 >= 5`, it prints `-1`.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - `n = 6`, `k = [7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13]`
  - LCM of `[7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13]` is `19899`.
  - Bets: `19899/7 = 2843`, `19899/9 = 2211`, `19899/3 = 6633`, `19899/17 = 1171`, `19899/9 = 2211`, `19899/13 = 1531`.
  - Sum: `2843 + 2211 + 6633 + 1171 + 2211 + 1531 = 16590`.
  - Since `16590 < 19899`, it prints the bets correctly.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - `n = 3`, `k = [6, 3, 2]`
  - LCM of `[6, 3, 2]` is `6`.
  - Bets: `6/6 = 1`, `6/3 = 2`, `6/2 = 3`.
  - Sum: `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
  - Since `6 >= 6`, it prints `-1`.

- **Test Case 6:**
  - `n = 5`, `k = [9, 4, 6, 8, 3]`
  - LCM of `[9, 4, 6, 8, 3]` is `72`.
  - Bets: `72/9 = 8`, `72/4 = 18`, `72/6 = 12`, `72/8 = 9`, `72/3 = 24`.
  - Sum: `8 + 18 + 12 + 9 + 24 = 61`.
  - Since `61 < 72`, it prints the bets correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program handles the problem correctly for all given examples and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
