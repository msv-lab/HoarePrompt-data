State: **`t` is an input integer, and each test case contains an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` where 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20 for all `i`, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, `T` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `T` is used to iterate through the test cases.
2. For the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0 because the loop starts from 0 and runs until `T-1`.
3. The initial state of `t` (which is the number of test cases) does not directly affect whether the loop will execute, but it indirectly affects how many times the loop will run.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `T` is greater than 0.

Thus, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring `T` is greater than 0.
