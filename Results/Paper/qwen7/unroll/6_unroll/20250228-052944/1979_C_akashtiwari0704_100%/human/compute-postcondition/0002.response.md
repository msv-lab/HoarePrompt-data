Output State: t is an input integer, and each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all i. After executing the loop, for each test case, the output is either -1 if the sum of the modified list (where each element is replaced by the product of all elements divided by itself) is greater than or equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of the original list, or a string containing the modified list elements separated by spaces if the condition is not met. The sumo variable holds the sum of the modified list, and the prod variable stores the LCM of the original list.
