### Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the program is correct based on the provided examples and edge cases. However, upon closer inspection, there are some issues with the logic and the approach taken by the program. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The LCM calculation is correct and necessary to ensure that the sum of the bets is minimized while still covering the required conditions.
   
2. **Bet Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the bets as \( a[i] = \text{lcm}(a) / a[i] \). This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the sum of the bets will be strictly less than the smallest multiplier \( k_i \).

3. **Sum of Bets:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM. However, this check is not sufficient to ensure that the sum is strictly less than the smallest multiplier \( k_i \).

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - **Test Case 1:**
     - `n = 3`, `k = [3, 2, 7]`
     - LCM of `[3, 2, 7]` is `42`.
     - Bets: `42/3 = 14`, `42/2 = 21`, `42/7 = 6`.
     - Sum: `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`.
     - Since `41 < 42`, it prints the bets correctly.
   - **Test Case 2:**
     - `n = 2`, `k = [3, 3]`
     - LCM of `[3, 3]` is `3`.
     - Bets: `3/3 = 1`, `3/3 = 1`.
     - Sum: `1 + 1 = 2`.
     - Since `2 < 3`, it prints the bets correctly.
   - **Test Case 3:**
     - `n = 5`, `k = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
     - LCM of `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]` is `5`.
     - Bets: `5/5 = 1`, `5/5 = 1`, `5/5 = 1`, `5/5 = 1`, `5/5 = 1`.
     - Sum: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`.
     - Since `5 >= 5`, it prints `-1` correctly.
   - **Test Case 4:**
     - `n = 6`, `k = [7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13]`
     - LCM of `[7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13]` is `19899`.
     - Bets: `19899/7 = 2843`, `19899/9 = 2211`, `19899/3 = 6633`, `19899/17 = 1171`, `19899/9 = 2211`, `19899/13 = 1531`.
     - Sum: `2843 + 2211 + 6633 + 1171 + 2211 + 1531 = 16590`.
     - Since `16590 < 19899`, it prints the bets correctly.
   - **Test Case 5:**
     - `n = 3`, `k = [6, 3, 2]`
     - LCM of `[6, 3, 2]` is `6`.
     - Bets: `6/6 = 1`, `6/3 = 2`, `6/2 = 3`.
     - Sum: `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
     - Since `6 >= 6`, it prints `-1` correctly.
   - **Test Case 6:**
     - `n = 5`, `k = [9, 4, 6, 8, 3]`
     - LCM of `[9, 4, 6, 8, 3]` is `72`.
     - Bets: `72/9 = 8`, `72/4 = 18`, `72/6 = 12`, `72/8 = 9`, `72/3 = 24`.
     - Sum: `8 + 18 + 12 + 9 + 24 = 61`.
     - Since `61 < 72`, it prints the bets correctly.

However, the issue lies in the fact that the program does not ensure that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the smallest multiplier \( k_i \). For example, in Test Case 4, the sum of the bets is `16590`, which is indeed less than `19899`, but it does not necessarily mean that the sum is strictly less than the smallest multiplier \( k_i \) (which is `7` in this case).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not guarantee that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the smallest multiplier \( k_i \). Therefore, the program may produce incorrect results in some cases.

**Final: False**
