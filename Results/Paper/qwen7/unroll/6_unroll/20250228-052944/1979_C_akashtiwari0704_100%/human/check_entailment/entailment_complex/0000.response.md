Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: The function `lcm` correctly calculates the LCM of the list of multipliers `a`.
3. **Bet Calculation**: For each test case, the program calculates the bet amounts by dividing the LCM by each multiplier and stores these values in the list `a`.
4. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of these bet amounts is less than the LCM. If it is, it prints the bet amounts; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the program logic matches the requirements perfectly. The only potential issue could be edge cases, but the problem guarantees that a solution exists if one is possible, and the code handles this correctly by printing `-1` when the sum is not less than the LCM.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
