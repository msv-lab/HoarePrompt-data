Output State: **`val` is equal to `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr` updated by 1 if `cnt` was previously assigned a value.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `cnt`. Since `cnt` is initially 0, unless `cnt` was previously set to a value greater than 1, `ans` remains unchanged. If `cnt` was set to a value greater than 1 before this line, `ans` will be updated to that value. However, since the initial state does not specify any prior value for `cnt`, we assume it starts at 0, and thus `ans` might be updated to 1 if `cnt` was set to a value greater than 1 before this line.
