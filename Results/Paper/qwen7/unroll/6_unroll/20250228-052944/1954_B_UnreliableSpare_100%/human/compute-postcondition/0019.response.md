Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers `a` for each test case defined by an integer `t`. It first checks if the list `a` contains consecutive different elements. If it does, it calculates the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the initial element in the list. If the list does not contain consecutive different elements, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the length of the longest sequence of consecutive occurrences of the initial element in the list.**
