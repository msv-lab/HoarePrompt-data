You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The given array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.

    flag = True

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `flag` is False.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop checks if each element in `arr` is different from its previous element. If any two consecutive elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. Therefore, `flag` will be `False` if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements that are different. If all elements are the same or no two consecutive elements are different, `flag` remains `True`.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
        
    #State: Output State: `val` is equal to `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `flag` is False, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the length of the longest sequence of consecutive occurrences of val in arr)
    #State: Postcondition: `val` is equal to `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`. If the flag is True, `ans` is updated by 1 if `cnt` was previously assigned a value. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (`flag` variable).
   - If the array is uniform, it prints `-1` because no elements need to be removed to make it non-uniform.
   - If the array is not uniform, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove using the logic:
     - It iterates through the array and counts consecutive occurrences of the same value.
     - It keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive elements to remove to break the uniformity.
   - Finally, it prints the result.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array is already uniform.
   - It also correctly identifies and removes the minimum number of elements to break the uniformity.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic for checking if the array is uniform is correct.
   - The logic for calculating the minimum number of elements to remove is also correct.
   - The program handles all given constraints and examples correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct according to the problem description and constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
