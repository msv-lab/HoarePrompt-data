### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (`flag` variable).
   - If the array is uniform, it prints `-1` because no elements need to be removed to make it non-uniform.
   - If the array is not uniform, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove using the logic:
     - It iterates through the array and counts consecutive occurrences of the same value.
     - It keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive elements to remove to break the uniformity.
   - Finally, it prints the result.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array is already uniform.
   - However, the logic for calculating the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The current implementation only considers the longest sequence of consecutive elements and does not account for the possibility of breaking the uniformity by removing fewer elements.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic for checking if the array is uniform is correct.
   - The logic for calculating the minimum number of elements to remove is incorrect. The current implementation only finds the longest sequence of consecutive elements but does not ensure that removing fewer elements could potentially break the uniformity.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The program would find the longest sequence of consecutive `1`s as `3` and print `1` as the answer. However, removing the element at index `2` (value `2`) would break the uniformity, making the array `[1, 1, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful anymore. Thus, the correct answer should be `1`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program fails to correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove in some cases. Specifically, it does not consider the possibility of breaking the uniformity by removing fewer elements than the longest sequence of consecutive elements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to break the uniformity of the array.
