Output State: **`val` is equal to `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `flag` is False, `ans` is set to 'Infinity'.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `val` and `cnt`. `val` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `arr`, which is `arr[0]`. `cnt` is initialized to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
