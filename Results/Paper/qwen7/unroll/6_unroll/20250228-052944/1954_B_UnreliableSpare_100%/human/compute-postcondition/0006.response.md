Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `flag` is False, `ans` is set to 'Infinity'.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to a value of `Decimal('Infinity')`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, or `flag`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The only change is that `ans` is now set to `Decimal('Infinity')`.
