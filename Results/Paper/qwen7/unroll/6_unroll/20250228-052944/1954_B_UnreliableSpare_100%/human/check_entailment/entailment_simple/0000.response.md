Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
3. It then checks if the array is already a sequence of identical elements by comparing each element with its predecessor. If any two consecutive elements are different, it sets a flag to `False`.
4. If the flag remains `True` after the check, it means all elements are identical, and the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, so it prints `-1`.
5. If the flag is `False`, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. This is done by counting the maximum length of consecutive identical elements and subtracting this length from `n`.

However, there are several issues with the current implementation:
- The variable `flag` is not used correctly. It should be used to determine whether the array is already a sequence of identical elements.
- The logic for calculating the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The current approach only counts the maximum length of consecutive identical elements but does not account for the need to break the sequence completely.
- The function `func_1()` does not handle the case where the array is already a sequence of identical elements correctly.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
