Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `not vis[s] and k > 0`.
2. **Analyze each part of the loop condition**:
   - `not vis[s]`: This means that the element at index `s[0]` in the `vis` list should be `0`.
   - `k > 0`: This means that the variable `k` should be greater than `0`.

3. **Check the current state**:
   - `vis` is a list of `n` elements, each set to `0`.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer representing the duration of the game.

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - Since `vis` is a list of `n` elements, all of them are `0` initially. Therefore, `vis[s]` will be `0` regardless of the values in `s`.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer, and since it is given as a non-negative integer, it can be any non-negative value. For the loop to execute the first time, `k` must be greater than `0`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` to ensure it is greater than `0`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mx` is 0, `n` is equal to the length of the list `p`, `a` is a list of integers representing the array `a`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `s` is a list of integers representing the starting positions (P_B, P_S) for Bodya and Sasha, `k` must be greater than 0, `cur` is 0, `vis` is a list of n elements, each set to 0**
