Output State: **`mx` is 0, `n` is equal to the length of the list `p`, `a` is a list of integers representing the array `a`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `s` is a list of integers representing the starting positions (P_B, P_S) for Bodya and Sasha, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the duration of the game, `cur` is 0, `vis` is a list of n elements, each set to 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `vis` with `n` elements, each set to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `vis` list along with the unchanged values of the other variables.
