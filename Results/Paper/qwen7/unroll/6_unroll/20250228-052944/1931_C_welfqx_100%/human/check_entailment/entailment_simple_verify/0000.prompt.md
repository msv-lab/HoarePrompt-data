You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

    #State: Output State: The output state is a series of integers, each representing the value printed for each test case after the loop has executed all its iterations. For each test case, the output is calculated based on the logic inside the loop, which essentially finds the longest consecutive sequence of the same number in both the original and reversed arrays, and then prints the length of the array minus the maximum length of these sequences.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the array has multiple distinct values and the optimal operation involves selecting a subarray that includes the first and last occurrences of these values.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
3
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
2
1 2
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
1
0
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
4
1
1
```

For the first test case `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the optimal solution is to change the entire array to either `1` or `5`, which would cost 4 burles (changing all elements to `1` or `5`).

For the third test case `[1, 2, 3]`, the optimal solution is to change the entire array to any of the values `1`, `2`, or `3`, which costs 0 burles since all elements are already the same.

The program incorrectly handles these cases, failing to find the minimum cost for making all elements equal. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
