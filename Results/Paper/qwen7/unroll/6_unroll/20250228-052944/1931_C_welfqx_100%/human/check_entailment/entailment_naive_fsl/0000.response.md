Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the array has multiple distinct values and the optimal operation involves selecting a subarray that includes the first and last occurrences of these values.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
3
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
2
1 2
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
1
0
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
4
1
1
```

For the first test case `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the optimal solution is to change the entire array to either `1` or `5`, which would cost 4 burles (changing all elements to `1` or `5`).

For the third test case `[1, 2, 3]`, the optimal solution is to change the entire array to any of the values `1`, `2`, or `3`, which costs 0 burles since all elements are already the same.

The program incorrectly handles these cases, failing to find the minimum cost for making all elements equal. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
