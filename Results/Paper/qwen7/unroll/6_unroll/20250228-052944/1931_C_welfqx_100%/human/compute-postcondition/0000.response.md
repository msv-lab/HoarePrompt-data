Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and for each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the array `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.`**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer remains true, and the structure of the problem for each test case (where `n` is a positive integer and `a` is an array of integers) is preserved. The specific values of `n` and the contents of `a` are not known yet, but their constraints are maintained.
