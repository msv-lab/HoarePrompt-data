Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each value of `t`, there is a corresponding `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) and a list `a` of `n` integers. After executing the loop, if `n` equals 1 or the minimum count of consecutive identical elements (`ans`) equals `n`, the output will be `-1`. Otherwise, the output will be the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum count of consecutive identical elements in the list `a`.
