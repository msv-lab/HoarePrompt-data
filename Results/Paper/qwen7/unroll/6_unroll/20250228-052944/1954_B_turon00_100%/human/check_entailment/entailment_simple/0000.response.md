Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
2. A beautiful array can be modified by replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
3. The provided solution iterates through the array and counts the maximum number of consecutive identical elements (`cnt`). It then finds the minimum count of such segments (`ans`) which indicates the minimum number of removals needed.
4. If the entire array consists of a single unique element or if the array itself is a segment of identical elements, it outputs `-1`.
5. The logic seems to correctly identify the minimum number of removals required to break the beauty of the array. However, there is a potential issue in the logic:
   - The code initializes `tmp` with `a[0]` and updates `cnt` only when `a[i]` is different from `tmp`. This means `cnt` will only count segments starting with `a[0]`. To properly find the minimum number of removals, we need to consider all possible starting points of segments.
6. The current implementation may miss some cases where removing elements from other parts of the array could result in fewer removals.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of removals needed to make the array non-beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
