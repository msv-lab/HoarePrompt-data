Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then determines the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same integer in the list `a`. If the list has only one element or the minimum segment length equals the list size, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the minimum segment length.**
