Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The solution attempts to count consecutive identical elements but does not properly handle the condition where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements. Here’s why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Non-Beautiful Arrays**: The code tries to find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements (`cnt`), but this does not guarantee that removing these elements will make the array non-beautiful. It only checks for sequences of identical elements without considering the structure of the entire array.

2. **Misunderstanding the Problem Constraints**: The problem requires checking if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements, not just identifying sequences of identical elements. The solution should focus on whether there are any "bridges" (i.e., positions `i` where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`) that cannot be removed without making the array non-beautiful.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to identify the longest sequence of elements that can be removed without breaking the "beautiful" property. This involves checking for the presence of "bridges" and ensuring that the array can be reduced to a state where it is no longer beautiful.

Here’s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Track the last occurrence of each element
        last_occurrence = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(a):
            last_occurrence[num] = i
        
        # Find the maximum distance between occurrences of the same element
        max_distance = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] == a[i-1]:
                max_distance = max(max_distance, last_occurrence[a[i]] - i + 1)
        
        # If the array has only one unique element, it's already non-beautiful
        if len(set(a)) == 1:
            print(-1)
        elif max_distance == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(n - max_distance)

func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. **Track Last Occurrences**: Use a dictionary to track the last occurrence of each element in the array.
2. **Find Maximum Distance**: Iterate through the array to find the maximum distance between occurrences of the same element.
3. **Check Conditions**: If the array has only one unique element, it is already non-beautiful. If the maximum distance equals the length of the array, it means all elements are identical, and removing any element won't make the array non-beautiful.

This approach ensures that the solution correctly identifies whether the array can be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements.
