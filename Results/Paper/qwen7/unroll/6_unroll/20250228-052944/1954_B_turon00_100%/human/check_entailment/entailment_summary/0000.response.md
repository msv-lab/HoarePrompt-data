Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same integer in the list `a`. However, this approach does not correctly determine whether the array can become non-beautiful by removing elements. Instead, it calculates the minimum segment length of identical elements, which does not directly relate to the problem's requirement.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Identify the positions where the array can be split into non-beautiful segments.
2. Calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to break these segments.

The current implementation does not account for the actual operations required to make the array non-beautiful. It only counts the minimum segment length of identical elements, which is not sufficient.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
