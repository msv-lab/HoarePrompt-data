Reasoning:
1. The problem requires processing multiple test cases where each test case is a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'.
2. The provided function `func()` correctly initializes counters for 'A' (`ac`) and 'B' (`bc`).
3. For each character in the input string, the function increments the appropriate counter.
4. After counting the characters for each string, the function compares the counts of 'A' and 'B' and prints the more frequent character.
5. The function does not handle the case where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. However, the problem statement specifies that all t strings are distinct, so this scenario should not occur.
6. The function does not store the counts of 'A' and 'B' for each string; instead, it overwrites the counters for each new string. This is fine because the problem asks for the most frequent character in each individual string, not across all strings.

Given the above points, the function correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
