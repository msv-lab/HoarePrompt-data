State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, q is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `q` starts at 0.
2. The loop condition `range(t)` means the loop will run `t` times.
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer, and specifically, it must be between 1 and 32 inclusive because `t` is the result of `int(input())` which is constrained to this range.
4. No other variables or states need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `t` (which must be between 1 and 32 inclusive) and `q` (which starts at 0).
