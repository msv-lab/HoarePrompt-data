You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

    0 2 4 1 
    0 0 0 0 0 
    0 0 0 4 4 4

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. The array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The string s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. After executing the loop, the variable y is a list of n integers representing the computed values based on the given rules, with y[-1] being the last computed value and y[i] for 0 ≤ i < n-1 being the intermediate values calculated during the backward iteration through the string s.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \), an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers, and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) consisting only of 'L' and 'R'. Based on the string \( s \), it calculates a sequence of integers \( y \) where each element \( y[i] \) (for \( 0 \leq i < n-1 \)) is derived from the previous elements and the array \( a \). The final element \( y[-1] \) is also calculated according to specific rules involving the last character of \( s \) and the array \( a \). The function then prints the sequence \( y \) for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where the array becomes empty before processing all commands. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Product Calculation**: The program calculates the initial product of the array elements and takes the modulus with `m`. This part is correct.
2. **Handling Array Removal**: The program attempts to handle the removal of elements based on the commands ('L' or 'R'). However, it does not correctly update the product as the array shrinks. Instead, it uses a fixed index approach which leads to incorrect results when the array size changes during the iteration.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example:
- **Input**:
  ```
  4
  4 6
  3 1 4 2
  LRRL
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  0 2 4 1
  ```

- **Actual Output**:
  ```
  0 2 4 1
  ```

This example seems to work correctly, but let's consider another scenario:

### Another Example:
- **Input**:
  ```
  4
  4 6
  3 1 4 2
  RRLR
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  0 2 4 1
  ```

- **Actual Output**:
  ```
  0 2 4 4
  ```

In this case, the program fails because it does not correctly update the product as the array size changes. Specifically, when the last command is 'R', the program incorrectly updates the product without properly adjusting the indices.

To fix this, the program needs to dynamically adjust the product as elements are removed from the array. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        t = input()
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        
        result = []
        for cmd in t:
            if cmd == 'L':
                if product == 0:
                    product = 0
                else:
                    product = (product * pow(a[0], -1, m)) % m
                a.pop(0)
            else:
                if product == 0:
                    product = 0
                else:
                    product = (product * pow(a[-1], -1, m)) % m
                a.pop()
            result.append(product)
        
        print(*result)
```

This corrected version dynamically updates the product as elements are removed, ensuring the correct result for all cases.
