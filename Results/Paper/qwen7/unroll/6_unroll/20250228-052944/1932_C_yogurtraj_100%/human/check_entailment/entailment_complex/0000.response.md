Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly initializes the variables and reads the necessary inputs for each test case.
2. It counts the number of 'L' commands in the string `t` to determine the position from which to start calculating the product of the array elements.
3. The logic for setting `k`, `q1`, and `q2` based on the last character of the string `t` is correct.
4. The backward iteration through the string `s` correctly updates the value of `k` based on whether the command is 'R' or 'L'.
5. The final product value `k` is assigned to `y[-1]`, and the intermediate values are stored in `y` in reverse order.
6. The output is printed in the correct order, as required.

Given the above points, the annotated program correctly implements the specified algorithm and logic.

Correctness: **True**
