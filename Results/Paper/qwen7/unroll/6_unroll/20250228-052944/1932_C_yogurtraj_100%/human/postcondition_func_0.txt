The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \), an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers, and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) consisting only of 'L' and 'R'. Based on the string \( s \), it calculates a sequence of integers \( y \) where each element \( y[i] \) (for \( 0 \leq i < n-1 \)) is derived from the previous elements and the array \( a \). The final element \( y[-1] \) is also calculated according to specific rules involving the last character of \( s \) and the array \( a \). The function then prints the sequence \( y \) for each test case.
