### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided code and the function summaries to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Introverts**: Each introvert needs a tent alone, so `a` introverts require `a` tents.
2. **Extroverts**: Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Therefore, we need to find the minimum number of tents required for `b` extroverts and `c` universals to form complete groups of 3.
3. **Universals**: Universals can share a tent with anyone, so they can help fill the remaining spots in the tents for extroverts.

#### Provided Code:
- **Function `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**:
  - This function calculates the minimum number of tents needed for `extroverts` and `universals`.
  - It checks if `extroverts % 3 == 0`. If not, it checks if the remainder plus `universals` is at least 3. If true, it returns the number of tents using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.
  - If the condition is not met, it returns `None`.

- **Function `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**:
  - This function calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals`.
  - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1` indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone.
  - Otherwise, it adds the number of tents returned by `func_1` to the number of tents required for `introverts`.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic for `func_1` is flawed because it incorrectly handles cases where a small number of extroverts and universals can still form a group of 3.
   - For example, if `extroverts = 1` and `universals = 1`, `func_1` would return `None` because `1 % 3 + 1 < 3`, but actually, 1 extrovert and 1 universal can form a group of 3 when combined with another universal.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly uses `func_1` to calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - However, the handling of the case where `func_1` returns `None` is correct, ensuring that the function returns `-1` if it's impossible to accommodate everyone.

#### Corrected `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    # Calculate the number of complete groups of 3
    full_groups = extroverts // 3
    remaining_extroverts = extroverts % 3
    # Remaining universals can form additional groups
    additional_groups = min(remaining_extroverts, universals)
    remaining_universals = max(0, universals - additional_groups)
    # Total groups formed
    total_groups = full_groups + additional_groups
    # Remaining people who cannot form a group
    remaining_people = remaining_extrovers + remaining_universals
    if remaining_people > 0:
        return None
    return total_groups
```

Given this, the original implementation is **incorrect** because it does not handle all edge cases properly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the flaws in the `func_1` function. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
