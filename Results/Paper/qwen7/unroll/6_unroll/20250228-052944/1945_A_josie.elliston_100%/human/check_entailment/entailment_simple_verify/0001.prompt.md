You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Introverts**: Each introvert needs a tent alone, so `a` introverts require `a` tents.
2. **Extroverts**: Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Therefore, we need to find the minimum number of tents required for `b` extroverts and `c` universals to form complete groups of 3.
3. **Universals**: Universals can share a tent with anyone, so they can help fill the remaining spots in the tents for extroverts.

#### Provided Code:
- **Function `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**:
  - This function calculates the minimum number of tents needed for `extroverts` and `universals`.
  - It checks if `extroverts % 3 == 0`. If not, it checks if the remainder plus `universals` is at least 3. If true, it returns the number of tents using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.
  - If the condition is not met, it returns `None`.

- **Function `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**:
  - This function calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals`.
  - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1` indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone.
  - Otherwise, it adds the number of tents returned by `func_1` to the number of tents required for `introverts`.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic for `func_1` is mostly correct but has a flaw. Specifically, the check `if extroverts % 3 != 0` and the subsequent condition `if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` is not sufficient to handle all cases correctly.
   - For example, if `extroverts = 1` and `universals = 1`, `func_1` would return `None` because `1 % 3 + 1 < 3`, but actually, 1 extrovert and 1 universal can form a group of 3 when combined with another universal.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly uses `func_1` to calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - However, the handling of the case where `func_1` returns `None` is correct, ensuring that the function returns `-1` if it's impossible to accommodate everyone.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly handle all edge cases for the `func_1` function. Specifically, it fails to account for scenarios where a small number of extroverts and universals can still form a group of 3.

#### Corrected `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    # Calculate the number of complete groups of 3
    full_groups = extroverts // 3
    remaining_extroverts = extroverts % 3
    # Remaining universals can form additional groups
    additional_groups = min(remaining_extroverts, universals)
    remaining_universals = max(0, universals - additional_groups)
    # Total groups formed
    total_groups = full_groups + additional_groups
    # Remaining people who cannot form a group
    remaining_people = remaining_extroverts + remaining_universals
    if remaining_people > 0:
        return None
    return total_groups
```

Given this, the original implementation is **incorrect** because it does not handle all edge cases properly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
