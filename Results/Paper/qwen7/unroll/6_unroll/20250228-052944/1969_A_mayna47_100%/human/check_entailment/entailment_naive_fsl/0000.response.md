Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where no pair of friends are each other's best friends. In such a scenario, the program always prints 3, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
2
2 1
```

The correct output should be `2` because Monocarp can invite both friends 1 and 2, and both will come to the party. However, the program incorrectly outputs `3`.

To fix this, the program needs to check if there exists any pair of friends who are each other's best friends and handle that case separately.
