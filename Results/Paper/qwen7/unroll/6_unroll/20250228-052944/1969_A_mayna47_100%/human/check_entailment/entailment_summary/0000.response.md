Reasoning:
- The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, but the function `func_1()` inside the loop only processes one test case at a time. This means the function `func_1()` should be called `t` times within the main loop.
- The program correctly constructs the list `v` based on the input list `p`.
- The logic inside `func_1()` checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., `v[v[i]] == i`). If such a pair is found, it prints `2` because inviting both of them would ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
- If no such pair is found, it prints `3`, which is the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party based on the given constraints.

However, the program currently does not call `func_1()` for each test case. Instead, it calls `func_1()` once and then exits without processing the remaining test cases. This means the program will only process the first test case and ignore the rest, leading to incorrect results for multi-test case scenarios.

Correctness: **False**

To fix this, the program should call `func_1()` inside the loop that iterates over the test cases:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()
```

This change ensures that each test case is processed correctly.
