Output State: **`i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and n inclusive.**

The code initializes the variable `i` to 0. No changes are made to the list `arr`. Therefore, the length and contents of the list remain unchanged from the initial state.
