### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The variable `day` is initialized to `'AM'`.
   - The variable `n` is correctly assigned the number of test cases, which is read from the input.
   - The loop runs `n` times, processing each test case.

2. **Time Conversion Logic**:
   - For each test case, the time is split into `h` (hour) and `m` (minute).
   - If `h` is `0`, it is converted to `12` and `day` is set to `'AM'`.
   - If `h` is greater than `12`, it is adjusted by subtracting `12` and `day` is set to `'PM'`.
   - If `h` is `12`, `day` is set to `'AM'`.
   - Otherwise, `day` is set to `'PM'`.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The time is printed in the format `hh:mm AM/PM` using formatted string literals (`f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'`), ensuring that `h` and `m` are zero-padded to two digits.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic handles the edge cases where `h` is `0` (converted to `12 AM`) and `h` is `12` (converted to `12 AM` or `12 PM` depending on the context).

5. **Consistency**:
   - The state at the end of the function (`day` is `'AM'`, `n` is `0`, `h` is `00`, `m` is `00`) does not affect the correctness of the function since the function processes each test case independently.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly converts the 24-hour format time to the 12-hour format and prints the results in the specified format.

### Correctness:
