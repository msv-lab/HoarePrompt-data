You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

Example

Input

    11
    
    09:41
    
    18:06
    
    12:14
    
    00:59
    
    00:00
    
    14:34
    
    01:01
    
    19:07
    
    11:59
    
    12:00
    
    21:37

Output

    09:41 AM
    06:06 PM
    12:14 PM
    12:59 AM
    12:00 AM
    02:34 PM
    01:01 AM
    07:07 PM
    11:59 AM
    12:00 PM
    09:37 PM

- Program:
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'PM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of time inputs in the format "hh:mm" and converts them to a 12-hour clock format with AM/PM indicators. It prints each converted time. After processing all inputs, the final state includes `day` set to either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` set to 0, and `h` and `m` both set to 00.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when the hour is 12 in the 24-hour format. According to the problem description, 12 in the 24-hour format should be 12:00 PM, but the program incorrectly sets it to 12:00 AM when `h == 12`. This can be seen in the test case "12:00", which should output "12:00 PM" but instead outputs "12:00 AM".

To fix this, the condition for setting `day` to 'PM' should be changed to:
```python
if h >= 12:
    day = 'PM'
else:
    day = 'AM'
```
This ensures that 12:00 is correctly converted to "12:00 PM".
