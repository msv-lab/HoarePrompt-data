Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` should be initialized to 0 (the starting value for the `range` function).
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 0, as per the loop condition.

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final State**:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

Since `t` and `a` are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution, they do not need to be adjusted.

**State**: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
