Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a` which now contains unique elements from the original list `a` after removing duplicates; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order where each element a[i] was originally increased by (i + 1) for all i in the range of n.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `a` in descending order. The other variables (`counter`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged. The elements of `a` are sorted in reverse order, meaning the largest elements come first. Each element in `a` was originally increased by `(i + 1)` for all `i` in the range of `n`, and now they are sorted in descending order.
