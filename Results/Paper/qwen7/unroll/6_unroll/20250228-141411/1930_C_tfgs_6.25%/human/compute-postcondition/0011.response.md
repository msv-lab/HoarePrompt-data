Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the range of the loop**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(a) - 1`.

3. **Initial state of variables**:
   - `counter`: A Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
   - `t`: A positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`: An input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a`: A list of integers sorted in descending order where each element `a[i]` was originally increased by `(i + 1)` for all `i` in the range of `n`.
   - `cnt`: The difference between `n` and the length of `a`, i.e., `cnt = n - len(a)`.
   - `ans`: An empty list.

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `0` to `len(a) - 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be initialized to `0` and the condition `i < len(a)` must hold true for the loop to continue executing.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to `0`.
- `i` must be less than `len(a)` for the loop to continue executing.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `i` must be less than `len(a)`**
