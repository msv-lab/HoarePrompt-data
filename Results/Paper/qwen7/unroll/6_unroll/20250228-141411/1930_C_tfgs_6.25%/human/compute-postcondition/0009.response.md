Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a` which now contains unique elements from the original list `a` after removing duplicates; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order where each element a[i] was originally increased by (i + 1) for all i in the range of n; `cnt` is n - len(a).**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is assigned the value of `n - len(a)`. Since `n` is an input integer and `len(a)` is the length of the list `a`, `cnt` is calculated as the difference between `n` and the number of elements in `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
