Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and then converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
