Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element a[i] is increased by (i + 1) for all i in the range of n.**

Explanation: The code `counter = Counter(a)` creates a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the modified list `a` remain unchanged from the initial state.
