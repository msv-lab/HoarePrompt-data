Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `ii`, which is used as the loop counter. It is initialized by calling `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `ii`**: Since `ii` is initialized by reading an integer from input, its initial value is unknown until the input is provided. However, for the loop to execute, `ii` must be a non-negative integer.

3. **Constraints on `ii`**: The constraints given are that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, where `t` is the number of test cases. This means `ii` must be between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set `ii` to a valid starting value. The smallest possible value for `ii` is 1, and the largest is 10^4. Therefore, we can set `ii` to 1 (the smallest valid value) to ensure the loop starts executing.

Given the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `ii` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`ii` is 1**
