Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly find the value of \( y \) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. Instead, it simply prints \( x - 1 \) for each test case, which is not necessarily the optimal \( y \).

For example, consider \( x = 10 \):
- The program outputs \( y = 9 \).
- However, \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).
- But, \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\), which is the same but \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9\) might not always be the maximum.

Thus, the program does not guarantee the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
