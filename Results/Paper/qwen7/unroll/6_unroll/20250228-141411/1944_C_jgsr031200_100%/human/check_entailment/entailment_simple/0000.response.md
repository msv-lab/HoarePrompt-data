Reasoning:
1. The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, who play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively.
2. The provided code snippet does not match the problem description. It includes unnecessary functions (`build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, `dfs`) that are not used in solving the problem. These functions do not contribute to the logic required to solve the problem.
3. The relevant part of the code is the `func_1` function, which processes the input array `arr` and prints a value based on certain conditions involving the frequency of elements in `arr`.
4. To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice can always pick elements to maximize the MEX, and Bob can pick elements to minimize it. The key observation is that Alice will pick elements to fill the gaps in the sequence from 0 to n-1, while Bob will try to block her.

Given the provided `func_1` function, let's analyze its correctness:
- The function counts the frequency of each element in `arr`.
- It then checks for the first index `i` where the frequency is less than 2.
- If such an index is found, it prints the index and breaks the loop.

This approach does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob. Instead, it should focus on ensuring that Alice maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it. Specifically, Alice should aim to create a sequence in `c` that includes all numbers from 0 to MEX-1, while Bob tries to disrupt this.

The provided function does not achieve this. It simply prints the first index `i` where the frequency is less than 2, which does not reflect the optimal strategy for either player.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
