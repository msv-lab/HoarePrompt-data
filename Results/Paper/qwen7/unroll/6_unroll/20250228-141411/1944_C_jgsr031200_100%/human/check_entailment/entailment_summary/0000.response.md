Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is designed to find the first integer that appears exactly once or does not appear at all in the array `arr`. However, this function does not simulate the game between Alice and Bob or compute the MEX of the array `c` as required.

The problem requires simulating the game where Alice and Bob take turns to pick elements from the array `a`, and the final score is determined by the MEX of the array `c`. The current implementation of `func_1` does not account for the game rules or the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

Given the execution summary, it is clear that the function does not perform the necessary operations to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
