Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `arr` and returns nothing. It calculates the frequency of each integer in `arr` and prints the first integer that appears exactly once or does not appear at all, breaking the loop once such an integer is found. If no such integer is found, it prints nothing.**
