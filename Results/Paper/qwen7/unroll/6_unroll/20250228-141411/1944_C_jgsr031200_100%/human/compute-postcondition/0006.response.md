Output State: `cou` is 0, `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `freq[i]` represents the number of times `i` appears in the original list `arr`. The loop has executed but did not print any value and did not break because the conditions inside the loop were not met for any `i` in the range `0` to `n`.
