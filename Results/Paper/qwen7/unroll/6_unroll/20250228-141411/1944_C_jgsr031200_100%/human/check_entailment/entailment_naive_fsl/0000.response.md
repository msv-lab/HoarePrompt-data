Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the MEX of the array `c` based on the frequency of elements in `arr`, but it does not simulate the game process where Alice and Bob take turns picking and removing elements from `arr`.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

Consider the input:
```
2
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
```

Expected output:
```
2
1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
1
```

This happens because the program does not simulate the game process. In the first test case, the optimal strategy would be:
1. Alice picks `1`, so `a = [0, 0, 1]` and `c = [1]`.
2. Bob picks `0`, so `a = [0, 1]` and `c = [1]`.
3. Alice picks `0`, so `a = [1]` and `c = [1, 0]`.
4. Bob picks `1`, so `a = []` and `c = [1, 0]`.

The MEX of `[1, 0]` is `2`. The program, however, incorrectly calculates the MEX based on the frequency of elements, leading to incorrect results.
