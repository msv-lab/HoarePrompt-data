Output State: **`s` is True, `lst` is a defaultdict where each key represents a node and its value is a list of nodes connected to it by an edge.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `s`. This does not affect the `lst` dictionary, which remains unchanged from its initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `s` is now `True`.
