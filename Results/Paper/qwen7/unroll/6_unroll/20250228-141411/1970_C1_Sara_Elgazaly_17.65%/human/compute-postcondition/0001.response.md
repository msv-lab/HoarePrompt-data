Output State: **`lst` is a defaultdict with no initial key-value pairs, `x` is an integer input from the first split, `y` is an integer input from the second split, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer u_1 such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.**

The code initializes a defaultdict named `lst` with no initial key-value pairs. All other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`) retain their initial conditions as specified in the initial state.
