Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of N non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < N. The sum of all N values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. After executing the loop, for each test case, if there is at least one element in the list a with a count of exactly 1 in the dictionary cnt, the smallest such element is printed; otherwise, if no such element exists, the loop breaks without printing anything.
