Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list a of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i < n). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the values of t, n, and the list a.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and a list of integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case, adhering to the given constraints.
