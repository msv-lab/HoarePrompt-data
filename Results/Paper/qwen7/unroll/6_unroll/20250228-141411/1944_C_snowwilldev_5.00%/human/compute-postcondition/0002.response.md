Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of N non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < N. The sum of all N values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. After executing the loop, for each test case, the variable `i` is the first integer in the list `a` that either appears exactly once or causes the count of any previously seen integer to reach zero, or `i` is the last integer in the list `a` if no such integer is found.
