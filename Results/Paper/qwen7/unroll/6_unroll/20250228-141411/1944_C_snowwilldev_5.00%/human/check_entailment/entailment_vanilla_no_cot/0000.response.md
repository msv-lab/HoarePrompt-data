Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. The logic in the `func` function does not account for the alternating turns and the strategic choices each player would make to maximize or minimize the MEX of the array `c`.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider the optimal moves for both players. Hereâ€™s a more accurate approach:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice will try to maximize the MEX by ensuring that the smallest missing number is as large as possible.
2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob will try to minimize the MEX by ensuring that the smallest missing number is as small as possible.

Given these strategies, here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def game_score():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Count the frequency of each number in a
        freq = [0] * n
        for num in a:
            freq[num] += 1

        mex = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if freq[i] == 0:
                mex = i
                break
            elif freq[i] == 1:
                mex = max(mex, i + 1)

        print(mex)

game_score()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Frequency Array**: We use a frequency array `freq` to count how many times each number appears in the array `a`.
2. **Finding MEX**: We iterate through the numbers from 0 to `n-1` and check the frequency:
   - If a number `i` has a frequency of 0, it means `i` is the MEX.
   - If a number `i` has a frequency of 1, we update the MEX to be the maximum of the current MEX and `i + 1`.

This approach ensures that the game is played optimally according to the rules and the strategies of both players.
