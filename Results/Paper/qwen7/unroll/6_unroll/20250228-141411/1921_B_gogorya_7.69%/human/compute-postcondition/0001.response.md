State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will run `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The initial state given is that `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive).
4. Since the loop requires `t` to be greater than 0 to execute, and the initial state already ensures this condition (as \(t\) cannot be less than 1), no adjustment is needed beyond ensuring `t > 0`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `t` must be greater than 0.
