Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element is updated based on the conditions inside the loop. If `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, then `ans[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is determined by subtracting `a[i]` from `left[i]` and finding the appropriate index using `func_1(left, x)` and considering `last[i-1]`. If no valid `inx` is found or if `inx` is less than 0, `ans[i]` remains -1.**

This means that the program will return the list `ans` which is constructed according to the given conditions. Each element in `ans` is determined by checking the value of `a[i]` against `a[i-1]` and using the cumulative sums stored in `left` and the last occurrence indices stored in `last` to find the correct value for `ans[i]`.
