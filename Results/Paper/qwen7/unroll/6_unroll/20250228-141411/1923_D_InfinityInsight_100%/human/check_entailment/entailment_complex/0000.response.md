Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly implements a binary search-like approach to find the index of a given value `x` in the list `a`. It handles the edge case where `x` is negative by returning `-1` immediately. The function logic is clear and aligns with the problem requirements.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes three lists: `left`, `last`, and `ans`. `left` stores the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to each index, `last` stores the index of the last occurrence of each unique element, and `ans` is initialized to `-1` for all elements.
   - **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: The function calculates the cumulative sums in `left` and updates the `last` list to keep track of the last occurrence of each unique element.
   - **Main Logic**: The main logic iterates through the list `a` and checks if the current element is less than the previous one. If so, it sets `ans[i]` to `1`. Otherwise, it calculates the position `inx` where the current element would fit in the cumulative sum array `left` minus the current element itself. It uses `func_1` to find the appropriate index and considers the last occurrence index to determine the minimum steps required for the current slime to be eaten.
   - **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases where no valid `inx` is found or if `inx` is less than 0, ensuring that `ans[i]` remains `-1` in such cases.

3. **Main Program**:
   - The main program processes each test case by calling `func_2` twice (once forward and once backward) and then comparing the results to ensure correctness.
   - The final result is printed as a space-separated list of integers representing the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten or `-1` if it is impossible.

Given the detailed analysis, the implementation of both `func_1` and `func_2` aligns with the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately. The main program also ensures that the results are processed correctly.

Correctness: **True**
