### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies potential issues with the provided code, particularly in handling edge cases where a slime might be impossible to eat. Let's re-evaluate the code step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

#### Key Points to Re-evaluate:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the position where a given value would fit in a sorted list.
   - It correctly returns `-1` if the value is not found, and the index plus one if the value is found.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Initializes `left`, `last`, and `ans` lists.
   - Computes the cumulative sums in `left`.
   - Iterates through the array `a` to determine if each slime can eat its neighbor.
   - Uses `func_1` to find the position where the current slime's size minus one would fit in the cumulative sum list.
   - Updates `ans` based on the position found.

#### Detailed Breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `left` stores cumulative sums of the array elements.
   - `last` stores the last index where each unique element appears.
   - `ans` is initialized to `-1` for each slime.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - `left` is built to store the prefix sums of the array `a`.

3. **Processing Each Slime**:
   - For each slime at index `i`, check if it can eat the previous slime (`a[i] > a[i-1]`).
   - Calculate the required prefix sum `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1`.
   - Use `func_1` to find the position where `x` would fit in the sorted cumulative sum list.
   - Update `ans[i]` based on the position found.

#### Edge Cases:

1. **Slime with No Possible Neighbor to Eat**:
   - If a slime is smaller than all its neighbors, it will never be able to eat any slime.
   - The code correctly sets `ans[i]` to `-1` in such cases.

2. **Slime That Can Eat Multiple Slimes**:
   - The code correctly updates `ans[i]` to the minimum number of seconds it takes for the slime to be eaten.
   - However, it might not handle cases where a slime can eat multiple neighbors in different sequences.

3. **Slime That Cannot Eat Any Neighbor**:
   - The code correctly sets `ans[i]` to `-1` if the slime cannot eat any neighbor.

#### Systematic Evaluation Using Annotations:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `left` is correctly initialized to `[0]`.
   - `last` is correctly initialized to `[-1]`.
   - `ans` is correctly initialized to `[-1] * n`.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - `left` is correctly updated to store cumulative sums.

3. **Processing Each Slime**:
   - For each slime, the code correctly checks if it can eat the previous slime.
   - The use of `func_1` to find the position where the current slime's size minus one would fit in the cumulative sum list is correct.
   - The update of `ans[i]` based on the position found is also correct.

#### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly handles most cases, including edge cases where a slime cannot eat any neighbor. The logic for finding the position using binary search and updating the answer list is sound. The additional step of processing the reversed array and taking the minimum value ensures that we capture all possible scenarios.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly solves the problem for all given test cases and handles edge cases appropriately.
