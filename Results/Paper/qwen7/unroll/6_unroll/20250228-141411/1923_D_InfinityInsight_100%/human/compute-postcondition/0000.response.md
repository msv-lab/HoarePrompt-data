Output State: **`left` is a list containing 0.**

The initial state defines that `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\), and `n` is between 1 and \(3 \times 10^5\). The variable `left` is initialized as a list containing a single element, which is 0. The provided code does not modify the value of `left`, so it remains unchanged. Therefore, `left` is still a list containing 0.
