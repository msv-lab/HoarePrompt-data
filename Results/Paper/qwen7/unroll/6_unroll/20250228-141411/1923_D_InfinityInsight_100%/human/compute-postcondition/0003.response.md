Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - The loop starts with `i` in the range from 1 to `n`.
   - Initially, `i` should be set to 1 because the loop starts from 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the state of `i` and `n`**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, we need to ensure that `i` is 1.
   - We also need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 (since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`).

5. **Consider the other objects (`left`, `last`, and `ans`)**:
   - These objects are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above steps, the required adjustments are:

- `i` should be 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
