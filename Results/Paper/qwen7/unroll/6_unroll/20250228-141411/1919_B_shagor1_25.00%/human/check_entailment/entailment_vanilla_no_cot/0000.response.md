Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not consider all possible ways to split the array `a` to achieve the minimum penalty. Instead, it calculates a simple difference between the number of '+' and '-' in the string `s`, which does not necessarily lead to the optimal solution. The program needs to consider different ways to split the array `a` and calculate the penalties for those splits to find the minimum possible penalty.
