Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `x != 0`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `mx` is 0.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `x` is an input integer - 1 (meaning `x` is already set to some value).
   - `subseq_lens` is an empty list.

3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `x != 0` must be true.
4. **Analyze the given state**:
   - The value of `x` is already set to some integer value (it is an input integer - 1).
   - We need to ensure that `x` is not zero for the loop to execute.

Given that `x` is an input integer - 1, it means `x` is already set to some value. To ensure the loop executes the first time, `x` must not be zero.

Since `x` is already set to some value (an input integer - 1), we do not need to change any state related to `x` itself because it is already in a form where the loop condition can be satisfied.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time based on the given conditions.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer - 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list**
