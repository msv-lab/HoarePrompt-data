Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `tickets_bought < k`.
2. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `tickets_bought` is 0.
   - `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

3. **Determine the adjustment needed**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `tickets_bought < k` must be true. Given that `tickets_bought` is currently 0, the only way to make the loop execute the first time is to ensure that `k` is greater than 0. 

4. **Check other variables**: The variables `total_cost`, `pq`, `n`, `m`, and `price_increase` do not affect the loop condition directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`tickets_bought` is 0, `total_cost` is 0, `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its index, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` must be greater than 0, and `price_increase` is 0**.
