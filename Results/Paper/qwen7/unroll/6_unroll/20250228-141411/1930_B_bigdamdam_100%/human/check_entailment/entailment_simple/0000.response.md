Reasoning:
1. The problem requires generating a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (with \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) exist where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
2. The provided solution attempts to generate such a permutation by placing even-indexed elements in descending order starting from \( n \) and decrementing by 2, and odd-indexed elements in ascending order starting from 1 plus the remainder when \( n \) is divided by 2, incrementing by 2.
3. Let's analyze the logic:
   - For even indices: \( p[0], p[2], p[4], \ldots \) are set to \( n, n-2, n-4, \ldots \).
   - For odd indices: \( p[1], p[3], p[5], \ldots \) are set to \( 1 + (n \mod 2), 3 + (n \mod 2), 5 + (n \mod 2), \ldots \).
4. This approach ensures that the even and odd indexed elements are placed in such a way that they do not form the required divisibility pattern because the even-indexed elements are strictly decreasing and the odd-indexed elements are strictly increasing.
5. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this method should produce a valid permutation for any \( n \geq 3 \).

Correctness: **True**
