Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required to place the icons. Here's why:

1. **Calculation of Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates `t` as `b * 2` and then checks if `t % 5 == 0`. If true, it divides `t` by 5; otherwise, it adds 1. This approach is incorrect because it doesn't account for the total space taken by 2x2 icons on the grid.

2. **Space Calculation for Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - After calculating `t`, the program tries to fit the remaining 1x1 icons into the available space. However, the logic for determining the additional screens needed is flawed. It incorrectly calculates the remaining space and the number of additional screens needed.

3. **General Logic Flaws:**
   - The program does not properly account for the fact that each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the remaining cells must be filled with 1x1 icons. The logic for distributing the 1x1 icons among the screens is overly complex and incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
- Calculate the total number of cells required for all 2x2 icons.
- Determine how many full 5x3 grids (15 cells each) these 2x2 icons will occupy.
- Calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
- Determine how many additional screens are needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Total cells required for 2x2 icons
        total_cells_2x2 = b * 4
        # Number of full 5x3 grids needed for 2x2 icons
        full_grids_2x2 = total_cells_2x2 // 15
        remaining_cells_2x2 = total_cells_2x2 % 15
        
        # Total cells left for 1x1 icons
        total_cells_left = 5 * 3 * (full_grids_2x2 + 1) - total_cells_2x2
        # Number of full 5x3 grids needed for 1x1 icons
        full_grids_1x1 = a // 15
        remaining_cells_1x1 = a % 15
        
        # Additional grids needed for remaining 1x1 icons
        additional_grids_1x1 = (remaining_cells_1x1 + 14) // 15
        
        # Total grids needed
        total_grids = full_grids_2x2 + full_grids_1x1 + additional_grids_1x1
        
        print(total_grids)


func()
```

This corrected program should accurately calculate the minimum number of screens required to place the icons.
