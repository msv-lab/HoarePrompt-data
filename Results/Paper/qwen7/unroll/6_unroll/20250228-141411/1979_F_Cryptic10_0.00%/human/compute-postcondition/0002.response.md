Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `remaining_vertices`.

2. **Understand the loop head variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `remaining_vertices`**: According to the given state right before the loop, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, `remaining_vertices` must not be empty.

5. **Adjust the state**: Since `remaining_vertices` is initially a set containing integers from 1 to `n`, and `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `remaining_vertices` will always contain at least one element (since \(n \geq 2\)). Therefore, no adjustment is needed to ensure the loop executes the first time.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop does not require any adjustments because `remaining_vertices` will always be non-empty when the loop starts.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n**
