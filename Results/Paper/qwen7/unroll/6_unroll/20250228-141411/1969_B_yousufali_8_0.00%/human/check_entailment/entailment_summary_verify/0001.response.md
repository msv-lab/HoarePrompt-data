### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires sorting a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. The cost of an operation is defined as the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to take a list of integers as input, but the problem specifies that the input should be a binary string. This is a fundamental mismatch.
   - The function `func_1` uses `input().split()` which expects space-separated integers, not a binary string. This is incorrect.
   - The logic inside the loop is intended to count the number of `1`s before encountering a `0` and add `n + 1` to `ans` when a `0` is encountered. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the required cyclic shifts.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case. Since `func_1` is incorrectly implemented, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

4. **Expected Solution**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the positions where the binary string changes from `1` to `0` and calculate the cost of cyclic shifts to move all `1`s to the beginning and all `0`s to the end.
   - We need to find the longest prefix that is sorted and then calculate the cost of shifting the remaining part to its correct position.

5. **Function Summaries**:
   - The function summary for `func_2` states that it processes a specified number of test cases, takes a binary string as input, sorts the string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts, and does not return any value. However, the implementation of `func_1` is incorrect, and thus `func_2` cannot achieve the expected result.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the analysis, the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The original assessment was accurate. The program is incorrect due to the mismatch between the expected input format and the implementation, as well as the flawed logic within the function.
