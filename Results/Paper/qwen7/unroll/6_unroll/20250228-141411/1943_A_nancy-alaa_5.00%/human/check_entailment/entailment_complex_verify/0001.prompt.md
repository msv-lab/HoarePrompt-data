You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

                print(i)

            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        first = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():

                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break

                first = True
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. After executing the loop, for each test case, if there exists an index i that does not appear in the list a, it will be printed first. If no such index exists, the loop checks for indices with exactly one occurrence and prints the first one found after setting `first` to true. If no such index is found, no output is generated for that test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers. It then determines if there is any index \( i \) (where \( 0 \leq i < n \)) that does not appear in the list. If such an index exists, it prints the index. Otherwise, it checks for indices that appear exactly once in the list and prints the first one found after setting a flag. If neither condition is met for a test case, no output is generated for that case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice picks elements from `a` and appends them to her array `c`, then removes them from `a`.
   - Bob picks elements from `a` and removes them without appending.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The goal is to find the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c` at the end of the game, assuming both players play optimally.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - The loop iterates up to `n` times, checking for the smallest non-negative integer `i` that is not in `mpp.keys()` or has exactly one occurrence in `mpp`.

3. **Issues in the Provided Code:**
   - The code does not simulate the game correctly. It only checks for the smallest non-negative integer `i` that is not in `arr` or has exactly one occurrence.
   - Alice and Bob's turns are not properly simulated. Alice should always try to maximize the MEX, and Bob should try to minimize it.
   - The logic for determining the MEX based on the optimal play of both players is missing.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - Alice will always pick unique elements first to ensure they are not repeated in `c`.
   - Bob will remove elements that are already picked by Alice to prevent Alice from getting higher MEX values.
   - The optimal strategy involves ensuring that the smallest missing number is maximized by Alice and minimized by Bob.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly simulate the game or determine the optimal MEX value. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
