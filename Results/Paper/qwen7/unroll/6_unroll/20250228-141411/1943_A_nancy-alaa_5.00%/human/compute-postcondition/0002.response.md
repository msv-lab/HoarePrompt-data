Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. After executing the loop, for each test case, if there exists an index i that does not appear in the list a, it will be printed first. If no such index exists, the loop checks for indices with exactly one occurrence and prints the first one found after setting `first` to true. If no such index is found, no output is generated for that test case.
