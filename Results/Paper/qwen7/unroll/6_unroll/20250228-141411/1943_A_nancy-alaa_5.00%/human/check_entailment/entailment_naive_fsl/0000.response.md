Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and the concept of MEX. Here's why:

1. **Game Rules**: According to the problem description, Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a`. Alice appends the chosen element to her array `c` and removes it from `a`, while Bob only removes the chosen element from `a`. However, the program does not simulate these turns correctly. It simply checks the presence of each index in the counter and prints the first missing index without considering the turns.

2. **Optimal Play**: The program does not account for the optimal strategies of both players. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The provided solution does not simulate the strategic choices that both players would make during their turns.

3. **Example Case**: Consider the following test case:
   ```
   1
   4
   0 0 1 1
   ```
   - The correct game sequence should be:
     1. Alice picks 0, `a` becomes [0, 1], `c` becomes [0].
     2. Bob picks 0, `a` becomes [1], `c` remains [0].
     3. Alice picks 1, `a` becomes [], `c` becomes [0, 1].
     - The MEX of [0, 1] is 2.
   - However, the provided program will incorrectly print 0 or 1 based on the first missing index, not considering the optimal play.

Therefore, the program does not correctly simulate the game and cannot produce the correct MEX value for all inputs.
