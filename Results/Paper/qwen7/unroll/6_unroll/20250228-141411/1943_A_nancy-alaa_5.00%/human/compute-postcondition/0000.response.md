Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in Python when the value of the loop counter is not needed.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute based on the input provided by `input()` function. Specifically, the loop will run as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop**: The initial state is given as follows:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that the input provided by `input()` results in a positive integer. Given that `t` is already defined and within the specified range, the loop will execute for each value of `t`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the one that ensures the loop can execute based on the input. Since `t` is already defined and within the required range, the loop will execute for each value of `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\)**

This ensures that the loop will execute for each value of `t` as expected.
