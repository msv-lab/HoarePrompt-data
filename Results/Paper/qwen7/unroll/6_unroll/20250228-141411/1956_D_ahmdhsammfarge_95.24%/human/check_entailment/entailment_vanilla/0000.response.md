Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
   - Each operation involves setting all elements in a subarray from index `l` to `r` to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.
   - The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to find the optimal subarray to perform the operation on to maximize the sum.
   - It calculates the sum of elements excluding each possible subarray and keeps track of the maximum sum and corresponding subarray indices.
   - However, the logic here seems flawed because it does not actually calculate the MEX value but instead sums elements in a way that doesn't align with the MEX definition.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function recursively generates a sequence of operations to set the entire array to a specific value.
   - It is called within `func_3` to generate the sequence of operations.

4. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function performs the actual operation on the identified subarray.
   - It sets the subarray to the MEX value and then recursively calls itself to ensure the entire array is set to this value.
   - The function also updates the array to reflect the new values.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation in `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly calculate the MEX value. It simply sums elements in a way that doesn't align with the problem requirements.

2. **Recursive Operation Generation in `func_2` and `func_3`:**
   - While the recursive approach in `func_2` and `func_3` seems to aim at setting the entire array to the MEX value, the base case and recursive steps do not correctly handle the MEX calculation and updating the array.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, particularly in how the MEX value is calculated and applied, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
