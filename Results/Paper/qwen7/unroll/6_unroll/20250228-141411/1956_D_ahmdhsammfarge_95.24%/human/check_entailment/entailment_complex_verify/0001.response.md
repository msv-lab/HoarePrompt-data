### Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect due to issues in the calculation of the MEX value and the application of the operations. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided annotations and the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function aims to find the subarray that maximizes the sum of elements when considering the MEX value. However, the current implementation does not correctly calculate the MEX value. Instead, it computes a sum involving the subarray boundaries and other parts of the array, which is not aligned with the MEX definition.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function is responsible for generating the sequence of operations to set the entire array to a specific value. It recursively calls itself to ensure the entire array is set to the MEX value. The base case and recursive steps are designed to ensure that the entire array is eventually set to the MEX value, but the MEX value itself is not correctly calculated.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function performs the actual operation on the identified subarray. It sets the subarray to the MEX value and then recursively calls itself to ensure the entire array is set to this value. The function also updates the array to reflect the new values. However, the MEX value is not correctly calculated, leading to incorrect operations.

### Detailed Evaluation:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function attempts to find the subarray that maximizes the sum of elements by considering the sum of elements outside the subarray and the length of the subarray squared. This is not equivalent to finding the MEX value.
   - The logic is flawed because it does not correctly identify the subarray that would yield the highest sum when the elements are set to the MEX value.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function recursively generates a sequence of operations to set the entire array to a specific value. However, the MEX value is not correctly calculated, leading to incorrect operations.
   - The recursive calls ensure that the entire array is eventually set to the MEX value, but the MEX value itself is not correctly determined.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - The function sets the subarray to the MEX value and then recursively calls itself to ensure the entire array is set to this value. However, the MEX value is not correctly calculated, leading to incorrect operations.
   - The function updates the array to reflect the new values, but the MEX value is not correctly determined, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the functions, particularly in the calculation of the MEX value and the application of the operations, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
