The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `r`, `l`, and `ops`. It does not return any value. If `r` equals `l`, it appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list and terminates. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `l - 1`, appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list, and then calls itself again with `l - 1`. This process continues until `r` equals `l`, at which point it appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list and stops.
