### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the subarray indices \( r \) and \( l \) that maximize the value of \((j - i + 1)^2 + \text{sum}(lst[:i]) + \text{sum}(lst[j + 1:])\). However, the function always sets \( r \) and \( l \) to the same value, which means it doesn't actually find the optimal subarray. This is a critical flaw because the problem requires finding the subarray that maximizes the sum of the elements plus the square of the length of the subarray.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is not used in the main logic of the program. It seems to be a recursive function that appends operations to the `ops` list, but it is never called in the provided code. Therefore, it does not contribute to the solution.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - The function `func_3` attempts to replace the subarray `lst[r:l + 1]` with a list of `n` elements, each being `n`, where `n` is the length of the subarray. However, the logic inside the function is flawed:
     - If the minimum value in the subarray is 0, it appends the operation twice, which is unnecessary.
     - It calls `func_2(r, l, ops)`, which is not defined in the provided code and thus causes an error.
     - The replacement logic is correct, but the presence of the undefined function call makes the entire function unreliable.

Given these issues, the overall program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The core issue lies in the incorrect implementation of `func_1`, which fails to find the optimal subarray, and the presence of the undefined function `func_2`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the flaws in the implementation of `func_1` and the presence of an undefined function `func_2`.

**Correctness: False**
