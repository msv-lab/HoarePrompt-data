Based on the initial state provided:

- `v` is a list of length `n+1` where the first element is `0` and the next `n` elements are integers from the input split and converted to integers.
- The condition `if v[v[i]] == i` determines whether "2" is printed or not. This condition checks if the value at the index specified by `v[i]` is equal to `i`.

Given the print statement `print(3)`, we need to determine what will be printed. The print statement directly outputs the number `3` regardless of the conditions or values of other variables.

Output: **3**
