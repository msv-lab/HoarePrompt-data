The function accepts integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (with 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and two lists `a` and `b` (where `a` contains `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, and `b` contains `m` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive). It calculates and returns the number of rightmost subarrays of size `n-m+1` in `a` such that the minimum count of any element in both the first `m` elements of `a` (`a[:m]`) and the rest of `a` (`a[m:]`) is at least `k`.
