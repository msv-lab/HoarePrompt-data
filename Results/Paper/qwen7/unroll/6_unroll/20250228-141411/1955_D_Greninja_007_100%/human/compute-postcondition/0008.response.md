Output State: `ans` is the number of rightmost subarrays of size `n-m+1` in `a` such that the subarray contains at least `k` unique elements that are also present in `b`, `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both `ca` and `cb` after processing all elements in `a`, `cb` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in the sorted list `b`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `m` ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `ca` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in the sorted list `a[:m]`, and the value of `sm` is the final sum calculated after the loop.
