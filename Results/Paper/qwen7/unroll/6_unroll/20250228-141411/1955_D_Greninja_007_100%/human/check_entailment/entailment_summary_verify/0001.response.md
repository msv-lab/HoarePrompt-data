### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is correctly defined to take the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count occurrences of elements in both arrays after sorting them.
   
2. **Initialization**:
   - `cb` is the counter for sorted `b`.
   - `ca` is the counter for the first `m` elements of sorted `a`.
   - `ans` is initialized to 0, which will store the number of good subsegments.

3. **Initial Check**:
   - `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of elements in `a` and `b` using the intersection of counters (`ca & cb`).
   - If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means the initial segment of length `m` is good, so `ans` is incremented by 1.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - The loop iterates through the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `m` to `n-1`.
   - For each new element added to the window (`a[r]`), if its count in `ca` is less than its count in `cb`, it means adding this element increases the count of matching elements, so `sm` is incremented by 1.
   - The element being removed from the window (`a[r-m]`) is decremented in `ca`, and if its count in `ca` is now less than or equal to its count in `cb`, `sm` is decremented by 1.
   - If `sm` is still greater than or equal to `k` after these updates, the current segment is considered good, and `ans` is incremented by 1.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns `ans`, which is the total number of good subsegments.

However, there is a critical issue with the logic in the sliding window part. Specifically, the logic for updating `sm` when an element is added or removed from the window is flawed. Hereâ€™s why:

- When a new element `a[r]` is added to the window, the code checks if `ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]` and increments `sm` by 1. This condition is not sufficient because it only checks if the count of `a[r]` in `ca` is less than its count in `cb`, but it does not account for the possibility that the count of `a[r]` in `ca` might already be greater than or equal to its count in `cb` before the addition.

- Similarly, when an element `a[r-m]` is removed from the window, the code checks if `ca[a[r-m]] <= cb[a[r-m]]` and decrements `sm` by 1. This condition is also not sufficient because it only checks if the count of `a[r-m]` in `ca` is less than or equal to its count in `cb`, but it does not account for the possibility that the count of `a[r-m]` in `ca` might already be less than its count in `cb` before the removal.

To fix this, we need to ensure that `sm` accurately reflects the minimum count of each element in both `a` and `b` throughout the sliding window process. The current implementation does not correctly handle these conditions.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate due to the flawed logic in the sliding window part. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
