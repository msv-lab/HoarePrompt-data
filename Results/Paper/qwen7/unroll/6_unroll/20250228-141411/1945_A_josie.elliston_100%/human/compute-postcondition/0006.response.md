Output State: **The program returns the ceiling value of (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, where extroverts is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts and universals is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals.**

Given the conditions:
- `extroverts` is a non-negative integer.
- `universals` is a non-negative integer.
- If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and `(extroverts % 3 + universals) >= 3`, then the condition `(extroverts % 3 + universals) >= 3` holds true.

The code calculates the ceiling value of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3. This means the program will return the smallest integer greater than or equal to the result of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`.
