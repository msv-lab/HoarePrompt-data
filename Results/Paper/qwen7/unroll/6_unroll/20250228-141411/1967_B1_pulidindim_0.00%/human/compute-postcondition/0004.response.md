Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes values for `t`, `n`, and `m` where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 2 * 10^6 inclusive. The function returns a result based on the conditions given for `n` and `m`, and it handles up to 10^4 test cases ensuring the sum of `n` and `m` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^6.**
