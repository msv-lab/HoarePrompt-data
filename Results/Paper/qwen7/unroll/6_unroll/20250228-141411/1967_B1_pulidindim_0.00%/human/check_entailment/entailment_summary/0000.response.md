Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly implements the solution for the problem statement.

### Problem Statement Analysis:
- We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
  - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
  - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Algorithm:**
   - The program initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`.
   - It enters a while loop where `count` is incremented starting from 2 up to \(m\).
   - Inside the loop:
     - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
     - `g` is calculated as `n / count`.
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
     - `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1` to it.
   - After the loop, the result is printed.

### Correctness Check:
- The logic in the given program does not seem to directly address the problem requirements. Specifically:
  - The program does not compute \(\gcd(a, b)\) for each pair.
  - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not checked.
  - The approach seems to be counting something related to multiples but not directly solving the problem.

### Example Analysis:
- For the example test case \((10, 8)\), the expected output is 14, but the program outputs 14, which might be coincidental rather than due to the correct logic.
- The program's logic appears to be more about counting multiples rather than checking the gcd condition.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. It does not check the required condition and instead seems to follow an incorrect heuristic.

Correctness: **False**
