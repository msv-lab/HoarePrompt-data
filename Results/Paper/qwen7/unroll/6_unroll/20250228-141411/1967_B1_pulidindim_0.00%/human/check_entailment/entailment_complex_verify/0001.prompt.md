You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: Output State: t is assigned the value of the number of test cases, n and m are updated after each iteration based on user input, and ans is the sum calculated for each test case after the completion of the loop. The final value of ans for each test case is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \). It calculates a value \( ans \) based on these inputs using a specific algorithm involving a loop that updates \( ans \) iteratively. Finally, it prints the computed value \( ans \) for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Count Initialization:**
   - The variable `count` is initialized to 2.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, which seems to be an attempt to initialize the answer with the count of valid pairs when `b = 1`.

3. **Loop to Calculate Valid Pairs:**
   - The loop runs from `count = 2` to `m`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
     - `g` is calculated as `n / count`.
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
     - `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1` to it.
     - `count` is incremented by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The final value of `ans` is printed.

### Verification Against Problem Statement

#### Conditions to Check:
1. **Range of `a` and `b`:**
   - `1 \le a \le n` and `1 \le b \le m`.

2. **Condition for Valid Pairs:**
   - `a + b` must be a multiple of `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)`.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)`.
   - The logic inside the loop does not accurately count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

2. **Incorrect Use of `g` and `countmins`:**
   - The variables `g` and `countmins` are used in a way that does not align with the problem requirements.
   - The adjustment of `g` by subtracting `countmins` does not seem to have any logical connection to the problem constraints.

3. **Initialization of `ans`:**
   - Initializing `ans` to `n` is incorrect because it does not account for the condition involving `b`.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
