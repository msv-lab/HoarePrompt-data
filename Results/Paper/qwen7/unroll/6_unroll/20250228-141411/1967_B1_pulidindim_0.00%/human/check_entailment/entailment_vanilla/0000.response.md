Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Count Initialization:**
   - The variable `count` is initialized to 2.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, which seems to be an attempt to initialize the answer with the count of valid pairs when `b = 1`.

3. **Loop to Calculate Valid Pairs:**
   - The loop runs from `count = 2` to `m`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
     - `g` is calculated as `n / count`.
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
     - `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1` to it.
     - `count` is incremented by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The final value of `ans` is printed.

### Verification Against Problem Statement

#### Conditions to Check:
1. **Range of `a` and `b`:**
   - `1 \le a \le n` and `1 \le b \le m`.

2. **Condition for Valid Pairs:**
   - `a + b` must be a multiple of `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)`.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)`.
   - The logic inside the loop does not accurately count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

2. **Incorrect Use of `g` and `countmins`:**
   - The variables `g` and `countmins` are used in a way that does not align with the problem requirements.
   - The adjustment of `g` by subtracting `countmins` does not seem to have any logical connection to the problem constraints.

3. **Initialization of `ans`:**
   - Initializing `ans` to `n` is incorrect because it does not account for the condition involving `b`.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
