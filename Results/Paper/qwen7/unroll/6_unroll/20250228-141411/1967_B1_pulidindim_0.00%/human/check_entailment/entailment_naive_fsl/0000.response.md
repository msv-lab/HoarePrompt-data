Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) but does not properly account for the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To illustrate this, consider the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):

- The program's logic is flawed because it does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it increments the count based on a simplified calculation that does not reflect the actual requirement.

For instance, let's manually check a few pairs:
- For \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 2\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since 2 is not a multiple of 1, this pair should not be counted.
- For \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 3\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since 3 is not a multiple of 1, this pair should not be counted.
- For \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\), \(a + b = 4\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2\). Since 4 is a multiple of 2, this pair should be counted.

The program's logic fails to correctly identify such pairs. Therefore, the output for the given test case will be incorrect, making the program incorrect according to the problem description.
