Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `not vis[s] and k > 0`.
2. **Analyze each part of the condition**:
   - `not vis[s]`: This means that `vis[s]` should be `False` for the loop to execute.
   - `k > 0`: This means that `k` should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `mx` is 0 (this is not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `cur` is 0 (this is not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `vis` is a list of `n` elements, each element being 0 (so `vis[s]` is `False`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `vis[s]` is already `False` (because each element in `vis` is 0), no adjustment is needed for this part.
   - For `k > 0`, `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` to ensure it is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
