The function processes a series of inputs, each consisting of integers \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \). For each set of inputs, it calculates a value \( s \) using a specific formula involving \( k \) and \( x \). It then compares \( a \) with \( s \) and prints 'Yes' if \( a \) is greater than or equal to \( s \), otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each input set. The number of input sets \( t \) is read at the beginning and controls the loop execution.
