Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the strategy for Sasha to ensure he can achieve any number of coins. Specifically, the program calculates `s` as the sum of Sasha's initial coins plus the potential winnings from a series of bets, but it does not account for the fact that Sasha needs to place bets strategically to ensure he can recover from losses and continue winning.

Consider the following case:
- Input: `2 1 1`
- According to the problem description, Sasha starts with 1 coin and can lose at most 1 time in a row. If he loses the first bet, he will have 0 coins and cannot place any more bets, making it impossible for him to ever have more than 1 coin.

The program incorrectly prints "Yes" for this case because it does not handle the scenario where Sasha cannot recover from a loss. A correct implementation would need to ensure that Sasha can always place a bet after a loss and still have enough coins to potentially win back his losses and more.
