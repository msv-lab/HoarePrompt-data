Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads the values of \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \).
3. The variable `s` is initialized to 1. This variable is intended to represent the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can eventually have any number of coins \( n \).
4. The loop iterates \( x \) times, updating `s` in each iteration. The update rule `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` seems to be an attempt to calculate how many coins Sasha would need to ensure he can recover from losing up to \( x \) times in a row.
5. The final check `if a >= s` determines whether Sasha can start with \( a \) coins and still be able to achieve his goal based on the calculated `s`.
6. The program prints 'Yes' if \( a \geq s \) and 'No' otherwise.

However, upon closer inspection, the logic for calculating `s` might not fully capture the conditions needed to ensure Sasha can achieve any number of coins \( n \). Specifically, the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` does not correctly simulate the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses \( x \) times in a row and then starts winning back his coins.

To properly solve this problem, Sasha needs to consider the worst-case scenario where he loses \( x \) times in a row and then starts recovering. The correct approach involves calculating the minimum number of coins required to recover from losing \( x \) times in a row and ensuring that Sasha can always recover from any sequence of wins and losses.

Given the provided execution summary and the problem statement, the program's logic does not fully address the requirement to handle the worst-case scenario of losing up to \( x \) times in a row. Therefore, the program might not be entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
