### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the example test cases.

#### Key Points:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Rearrangement**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
3. **Sorting Logic**: The program sorts the array and calculates the beauty assuming this will yield the maximum value. This is based on the idea that placing the smallest element at the start and the largest at the end, with the rest sorted in between, maximizes the differences.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
- This function is not directly used in the main logic but serves as a check to determine if the array needs to be rearranged.

#### Main Logic Flow:
- If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints `0` because the array is already in the optimal form.
- If `func_1` returns `False`, the array is sorted, and the beauty is calculated by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

#### Example Test Cases:
1. **Test Case 1**: 
   - Input: `3 2 1 3`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Sorting gives `[1, 2, 3]`, and the beauty is `(2-1) + (3-2) = 2`.

2. **Test Case 2**: 
   - Input: `3 69 69 69`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: The array is already sorted, so the beauty is `0`.

3. **Test Case 3**: 
   - Input: `5 100 54 80 43 90`
   - Expected Output: `57`
   - Explanation: Sorting gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, and the beauty is `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 57`.

4. **Test Case 4**: 
   - Input: `4 3 4 3 3`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Sorting gives `[3, 3, 3, 4]`, and the beauty is `(3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 1`.

5. **Test Case 5**: 
   - Input: `2 2 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Sorting gives `[1, 2]`, and the beauty is `(2-1) = 1`.

#### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the test cases by sorting the array and calculating the beauty.
- The logic of placing the smallest element at the start and the largest at the end, with the rest sorted in between, is indeed the optimal strategy to maximize the beauty.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is incorrect. The program does correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array by sorting and computing the differences.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
