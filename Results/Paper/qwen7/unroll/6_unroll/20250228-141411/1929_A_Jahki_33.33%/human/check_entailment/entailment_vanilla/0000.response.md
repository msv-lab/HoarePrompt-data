Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements as a string `case`.

2. **Parsing Input:**
   - The program converts the string `case` into a list of integers `a` using list comprehension and `isdigit()`.

3. **Checking Initial Order:**
   - The program calls the function `func_1(a, num2)` to check if the initial array `a` is already in non-decreasing order.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it means the array is already sorted, and the beauty is 0.
   - Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate the maximum beauty.

4. **Calculating Maximum Beauty:**
   - The program sorts the array `a` and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - This is done by iterating through the sorted array and adding the difference between each pair of consecutive elements to `beauty`.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the array `a` is already in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the array and counts how many times an element is greater than or equal to the previous element.
   - If the count is zero, it means the array is already sorted, and it returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Correctness Analysis:

- The logic for checking if the array is already sorted (`func_1`) is correct.
- The calculation of the maximum beauty by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements is also correct.
- However, there is a logical error in the main loop where the variable `num2` is used instead of `num` when calling `func_1`.

### Corrected Program:

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has a minor issue with the variable name `num2` in the call to `func_1`. After fixing this, the program should work correctly.

**Correctness: **True**
