Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in the `func_1` function and the main logic flow. 

- In `func_1`, the function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this check is not necessary for calculating the maximum beauty.
- The main logic flow assumes that sorting the array will always yield the maximum beauty, which is not true. The correct approach is to place the smallest element at the beginning and the largest element at the end, and then sort the rest of the array accordingly.

Here is a counterexample:

For the input:
```
3
4
1 2 3 4
```

The expected output is `5` because the maximum beauty is achieved by rearranging the array to `[1, 4, 2, 3]`, resulting in a beauty of `(4-1) + (3-2) = 5`.

However, the given program would sort the array to `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and compute the beauty as `(2-1) + (3-2) + (4-3) = 3`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and thus is incorrect.
