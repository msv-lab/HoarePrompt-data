Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The solution aims to maximize the sum by strategically choosing subarrays to sum up.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The maximum possible sum can be achieved by repeatedly summing the largest positive subarray and inserting the sum back into the array.
   - The key logic in the provided code is to find the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) under certain conditions and then use it to compute the final result.
   - The formula used in the code is `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the array `l`.
   - It then iterates through the array to find the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) under the condition specified.
   - Finally, it computes the result using the formula and prints it.

4. **Formula Explanation**:
   - `2 ** k * maxi - maxi`: This part accounts for the effect of adding the maximum subarray sum `k` times.
   - `+ sum(l)`: This adds the original sum of the array.
   - `% 1000000007`: This ensures the result fits within the required modulo.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles negative numbers correctly by resetting the cumulative sum when encountering a negative number larger than the current cumulative sum.
   - The modulo operation ensures the result is within the required bounds.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.

Correctness: **True**
