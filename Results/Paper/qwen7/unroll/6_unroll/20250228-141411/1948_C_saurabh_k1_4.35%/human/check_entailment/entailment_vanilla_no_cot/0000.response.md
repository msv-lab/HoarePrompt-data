Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it only checks the second-to-last column of the second row and makes a decision based on that. This is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

To correctly solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the robot for each test case and check if it can reach the target cell (2, n). Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(input())  # First row
        b = list(input())  # Second row
        
        x, y = 1, 1  # Start position (1, 1)
        
        while 0 < x <= 2 and 0 < y <= n:
            # Move down if necessary
            if x == 1 and b[y-1] == '<':
                x += 1
            elif x == 2 and a[y-1] == '>':
                x -= 1
            
            # Move according to the current cell's arrow
            if x == 1:
                y += 1 if a[y-1] == '>' else -1
            elif x == 2:
                y += 1 if b[y-1] == '>' else -1
        
        if x == 2 and y == n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This solution correctly simulates the robot's movement through the grid and checks if it can reach the target cell (2, n).
