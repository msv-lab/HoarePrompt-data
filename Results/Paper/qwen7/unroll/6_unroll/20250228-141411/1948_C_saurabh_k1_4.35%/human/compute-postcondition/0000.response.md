Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. However, since the loop index itself is not used within the loop (it is just a counter), we don't need to adjust its initial value.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute based on the input provided by `int(input())`. This input determines how many times the loop will run. Therefore, the key state to adjust is the input itself.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop**: The problem statement mentions that for each test case, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that the input to the loop (which is `t`) must be within this range.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value `t`.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
