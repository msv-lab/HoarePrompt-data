Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find beautiful pairs. Specifically, the program uses the modulo operation `-num % x` which can produce negative results, and this might not always yield the correct remainder when dealing with negative numbers. This can lead to incorrect counts of beautiful pairs.

For example, consider the following input:
- `n = 3`, `x = 5`, `y = 2`
- `arr = [1, 2, 3]`

According to the problem description, a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

Let's check the pairs:
- For \(\langle 1, 2 \rangle\): \(a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 2 = 3\) (not divisible by 5), so it is not a beautiful pair.
- For \(\langle 1, 3 \rangle\): \(a_1 + a_3 = 1 + 3 = 4\) (not divisible by 5), so it is not a beautiful pair.
- For \(\langle 2, 3 \rangle\): \(a_2 + a_3 = 2 + 3 = 5\) (divisible by 5), but \(a_2 - a_3 = 2 - 3 = -1\) (not divisible by 2), so it is not a beautiful pair.

Thus, there are no beautiful pairs in this example. However, the program would incorrectly count some pairs due to the modulo operation producing negative values.

To fix this, the program should use the modulo operation `% x` instead of `-num % x` to ensure the result is always non-negative.
