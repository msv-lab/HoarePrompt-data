The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers representing the elements of the array. It calculates and returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of specific conditions met within the corresponding array based on the values of x and y. Specifically, for each number in the array, it checks how many times the number modulo x has appeared before and how many times the negative of the number modulo y has appeared before, then sums these counts to get the result for that array.
