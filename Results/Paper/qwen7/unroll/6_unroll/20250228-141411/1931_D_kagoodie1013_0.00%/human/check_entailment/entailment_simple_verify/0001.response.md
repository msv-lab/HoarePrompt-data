### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Extraction:**
   - The program correctly reads the input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly extracts the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` for each test case.
   
2. **Dictionary Initialization:**
   - Two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, are initialized to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.

3. **Remainder Calculation and Count Update:**
   - For each element in the array, the program calculates the required remainders (`mod_x` and `mod_y`).
   - It updates the counts in the maps using these remainders.

4. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - The program calculates the number of beautiful pairs by checking the counts of the required remainders in the maps.
   - Specifically, for each element, it looks up the counts of elements with the same remainder when divided by `x` and `y`.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program iterates through all elements of the array exactly once, which is efficient given the constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases well, such as when `x` or `y` is 1, ensuring that all possible pairs are considered.
   - The use of `-num % x` ensures that the remainder is always non-negative, which is crucial for correct counting.

7. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the results in the correct format, printing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Conclusion:

After carefully analyzing the program and its annotations, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array, adheres to the problem constraints, and efficiently processes the input.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
