Output State: **The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is the count calculated from the corresponding array according to the given logic in the test_cases.**

This output state describes that the program returns a list of counts, where each count corresponds to the result of a specific logic applied to each array in the `test_cases`. Each element in the `results` list is derived from the respective tuple in `test_cases`, which includes the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself, to calculate the count as per the given logic.
