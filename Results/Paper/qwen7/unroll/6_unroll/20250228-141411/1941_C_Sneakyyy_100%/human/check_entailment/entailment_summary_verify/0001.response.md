### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to eliminate the substrings "pie" or "map". The provided solution iterates through the string and counts how many times it encounters these substrings.

2. **Iterating Through the String**:
   - The loop `while i < len(a) - 2:` ensures that we only check up to the point where the next two characters still exist, preventing out-of-bounds errors.
   - For each position `i`, it checks the substring `a[i:i+3]` to see if it matches "pie" or "map".

3. **Counting Removals**:
   - If the substring matches "pie" or "map", it increments the counter `ans` and skips ahead by 3 characters (`i += 3`).
   - If it does not match, it simply moves to the next character (`i += 1`).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The loop correctly handles overlapping cases. For example, in the string "ppiee", it would find "pie" at index 0 and increment `ans` and `i` to 3, then move to the next character without finding another "pie".
   - However, there is a critical issue with this approach. The function only counts the occurrences of "pie" or "map" and does not actually remove any characters from the string. Instead, it simply counts them, which does not fulfill the requirement of making the string beautiful by removing characters.

5. **Output**:
   - After the loop, it prints the count of removals, which is the number of occurrences of "pie" or "map" in the string, not the minimum number of characters to be removed.

6. **Validation**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the substrings "pie" or "map", but it does not actually modify the string to remove these substrings. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirement of making the string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to make it beautiful. It only counts the occurrences of "pie" or "map" without actually removing any characters. This means the program does not fulfill the requirement of the problem.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
