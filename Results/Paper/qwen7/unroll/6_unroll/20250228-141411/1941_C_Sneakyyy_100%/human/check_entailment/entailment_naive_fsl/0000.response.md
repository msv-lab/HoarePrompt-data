Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the string contains overlapping substrings "pie" or "map". For example, in the input "ppiee", the program would only detect one occurrence of "pie" and remove 1 character, but it should remove 2 characters to make the string beautiful. The current implementation increments `i` by 3 whenever it finds "pie" or "map", which skips over potential future occurrences of these substrings without checking them.
