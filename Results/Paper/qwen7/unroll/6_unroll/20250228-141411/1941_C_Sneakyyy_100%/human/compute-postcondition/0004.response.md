Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n`, a string `s` of length `n`, and then counts the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `s`. For each test case, it prints the count of these substrings and does not return any value.**
