Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variables here are the input itself, which will determine how many times the loop will run.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` provides a positive integer value. Since `t` is defined as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will execute `t` times.

3. **Determine the Initial State**: We need to ensure that the initial state allows the loop to execute. This means that the input should provide a valid positive integer within the specified range.

Given these points, the only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t`, because it directly controls the number of iterations of the loop.

**State:**
- `t` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.
