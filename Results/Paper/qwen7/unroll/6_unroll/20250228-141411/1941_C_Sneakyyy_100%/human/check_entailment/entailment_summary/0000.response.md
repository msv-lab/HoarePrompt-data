Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the string and counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie". However, the logic for counting and removing the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful is flawed. Specifically:

1. The program increments the index `i` by 3 when it finds either "map" or "pie", which means it skips over these substrings entirely without considering the possibility of removing fewer characters.
2. The program does not account for overlapping occurrences of "map" or "pie".
3. The program should aim to remove the minimum number of characters, but instead, it simply counts the number of times "map" or "pie" appears.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the requirement to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
