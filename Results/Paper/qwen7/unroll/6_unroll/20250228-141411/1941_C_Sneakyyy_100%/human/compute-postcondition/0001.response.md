Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with length n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 10^6. Additionally, ans is an integer representing the count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the input string a for each test case.
