### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already beautiful by comparing adjacent elements. If any two adjacent elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False`.
   - If the array is beautiful (`flag` is `True`), it prints `-1` because no removals are needed to make it non-beautiful.
   - If the array is not beautiful, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.
     - It initializes `ans` to infinity.
     - It iterates through the array, counting consecutive occurrences of the same value.
     - Whenever a different value is encountered, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive occurrences found so far.
     - Finally, it prints the result stored in `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Checking if the array is beautiful**: The logic for checking if the array is beautiful is correct. The loop correctly identifies if there are any adjacent elements that are different.
   - **Calculating the minimum number of removals**: The approach to find the minimum number of removals to break the beauty condition is flawed. The program only counts consecutive occurrences of the same value and does not consider the possibility of breaking the beauty condition by removing elements that are part of a sequence of equal elements.
   - **Example Analysis**:
     - In the second test case, the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` is not beautiful. The program correctly identifies that it needs to remove at least one element to break the beauty condition. However, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of removals as `1` instead of `2` because it only considers consecutive sequences.
     - In the fourth test case, the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]` is not beautiful. The program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of removals as `3` instead of `2` because it only considers consecutive sequences.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the requirement to break the beauty condition by considering all possible sequences of equal elements. It only considers consecutive sequences, which leads to incorrect results in some cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.
