### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already beautiful by comparing adjacent elements. If any two adjacent elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False`.
   - If the array is beautiful (`flag` is `True`), it prints `-1` because no removals are needed to make it non-beautiful.
   - If the array is not beautiful, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.
     - It initializes `ans` to infinity.
     - It iterates through the array, counting consecutive occurrences of the same value.
     - Whenever a different value is encountered, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive occurrences found so far.
     - Finally, it prints the result stored in `ans`.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1()` processes a single test case.
   - It checks if the array is beautiful by comparing adjacent elements.
   - If the array is not beautiful, it calculates the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element and prints this value.
   - If the array is beautiful, it prints `-1`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for checking if the array is beautiful is correct.
   - However, the approach to find the minimum number of removals to break the beauty condition has a flaw. The current implementation only counts consecutive occurrences of the same value but does not consider the possibility of breaking the beauty condition by removing elements in a way that disrupts the pattern.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The program would count the consecutive occurrences of `1` and `2`, but it would not correctly identify that removing the element at index `2` (value `1`) would break the beauty condition.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - In the example provided, the program fails to handle the case where the array can be broken by removing a single element that disrupts the pattern.
   - For the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program would output `1` because it counts the consecutive occurrences, but the correct answer should be `1` (removing the element at index `2`).

### Conclusion:
The given program is not correct because it does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition. The current implementation only considers consecutive occurrences and does not account for the possibility of breaking the beauty condition by removing a single element.

**Final: False**

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the longest subarray that forms a pattern that can be reduced to a single value. We can achieve this by identifying the longest alternating subarray and calculating the minimum number of removals required to break this pattern.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Find the longest alternating subarray
    max_length = 1
    current_length = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            current_length += 1
            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
        else:
            current_length = 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of removals
    if max_length == n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(n - max_length)

# Main loop
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This corrected version identifies the longest alternating subarray and calculates the minimum number of removals required to break the beauty condition.
