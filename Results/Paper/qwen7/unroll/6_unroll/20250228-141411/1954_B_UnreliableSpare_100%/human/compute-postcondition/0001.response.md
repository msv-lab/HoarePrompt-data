Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `a` is still valid but is now referred to as `arr`. The precondition that `a` is a beautiful list remains valid, though its contents are now stored in `arr`.
