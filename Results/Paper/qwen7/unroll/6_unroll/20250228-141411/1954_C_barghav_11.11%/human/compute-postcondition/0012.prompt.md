You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = m
            b[i] = n
        else:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = n
            b[i] = m
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is a string where the first half of its characters are swapped with the corresponding characters from `y` in ascending order, and `y` is a string where the second half of its characters are swapped with the corresponding characters from `x` in descending order.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: The value of `a` is printed out character by character in the same order it was initially.
    print()
    #This is printed: the characters of `a` (where `a` is the initial value that is printed character by character)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: the value of `b` printed out character by character in the same order it was initially.
    print()
    #This is printed: b (where b is the initial string whose characters are printed)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the strings x and y represent the same integer when their digits are reversed.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
