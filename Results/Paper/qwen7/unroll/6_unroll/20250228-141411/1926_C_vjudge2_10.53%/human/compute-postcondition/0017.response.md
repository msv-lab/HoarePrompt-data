Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. The function returns a result based on the values of `t` and `n` for each test case.**

This means the function `func_1` does not take any parameters when called directly but is designed to handle multiple test cases internally. Each test case involves two integers: `t` and `n`. The function processes these integers according to their ranges and returns a result specific to each test case.
