Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Initialization of Lists**: The program initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, with a size based on the maximum value of `n` across all test cases. This is unnecessary because the maximum digit sum for any number up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) is much smaller. Instead, it should initialize these lists based on the actual maximum digit sum, which is 18 (for numbers like 99999).

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Digit Sums**: The program attempts to calculate the digit sums using a nested loop, but it does not correctly handle the summation of digit values. Specifically, it incorrectly splits the number into its last digit and the remaining part and tries to add the results of their digit sums, which is not the correct approach.

3. **Summation Logic**: The logic for calculating the sum of digit sums is flawed. It does not properly accumulate the sums for numbers beyond 9. The program should use a more efficient method to compute the digit sums for each number up to \(n\).

4. **Output Handling**: The program prints the sum of digit sums for each test case, but it does not reset the state between test cases. This means that the state from previous test cases might affect the current one, leading to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
