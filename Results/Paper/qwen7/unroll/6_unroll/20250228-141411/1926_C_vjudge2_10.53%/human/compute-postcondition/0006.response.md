Output State: **The list `numbers` contains `t` integers; the list `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` + 1, with all elements initialized to 0; the list `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` + 1, with all elements initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `sum_values` with the same length as the maximum value in the list `numbers` plus one, and all elements in `sum_values` are set to 0. The lists `numbers` and `values` remain unchanged from their initial state.
