Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by precomputing the sum of digits for all numbers up to the maximum possible value (`2 * 10^5`) and storing these sums in the `values` list.
2. It also maintains a cumulative sum in the `sum_values` list to efficiently compute the final result for each test case.
3. However, there are several issues with the implementation:
   - The `values` list is not correctly initialized for numbers greater than 9. The current logic only handles single-digit numbers and does not correctly compute the sum of digits for multi-digit numbers.
   - The `sum_values` list is not updated correctly for multi-digit numbers.
   - The program does not handle the case where `n` is less than 10 properly.
   - The program does not reset the `values` and `sum_values` lists for each test case, which could lead to incorrect results if the test cases overlap.

Given these issues, the program will not produce the correct results for the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
