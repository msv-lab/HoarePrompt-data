Output State: **`nw` is True, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order where each element has been decremented by the cumulative sum of previous elements in the list, and `ls` is the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list.**

The code `nw = True` simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `nw`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `N`, `nums`, or `ls`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
