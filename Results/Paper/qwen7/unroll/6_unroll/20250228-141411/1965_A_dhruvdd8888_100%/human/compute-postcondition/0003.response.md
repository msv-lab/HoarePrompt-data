Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and '0' is added to the set `nums`.**

Explanation: The code `nums = sorted(map(int, nums))` converts each element in the set `nums` to an integer using `map(int, nums)` and then sorts the resulting list of integers in ascending order. The original set `nums` is replaced by a sorted list of integers, and '0' is still included in this list. The variables `t` and `N` remain unchanged from their initial states.
