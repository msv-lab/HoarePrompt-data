Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that could have been encoded based on the sum of the positions of its letters.
2. The annotated program correctly handles different ranges of the encoded value `n` to construct the corresponding 3-letter word:
   - If `n > 52`, the word starts with the character at position `n - 53` and ends with 'zz'.
   - If `n > 27`, the word starts with 'a', the second character is at position `n - 28`, and the third character is 'z'.
   - If `n == 27`, the word is specifically 'aay'.
   - Otherwise, the word is 'aa' followed by the character at position `n - 3`.
3. The logic in the program ensures that the constructed word is the lexicographically smallest possible for each given `n`.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the solution for the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
