Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints and the provided information, the function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. The constraints mentioned (t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78) seem to define the range of possible values for variables `t` and `n`, but they are not parameters of the function `func`. Therefore, based on the given information, the function `func` does not interact with any external parameters and does not produce any output.
