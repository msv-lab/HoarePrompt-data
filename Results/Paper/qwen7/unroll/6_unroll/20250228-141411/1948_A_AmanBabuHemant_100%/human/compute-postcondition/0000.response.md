Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, the output state reflects that `t` now holds the value of the input integer within this range. The precondition that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50 remains unchanged and is included in the output state for completeness, even though `n` is not directly involved in the given code snippet.
