Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5. It calculates a list `dp` of length `n` where each element is computed using the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)` for `i` ranging from 2 to `n`, starting with the initial values `[1, 1]`. After completing these calculations, it returns the last element of the list `dp`.**
