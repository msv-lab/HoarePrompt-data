Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `k`, and the positions of the rooks placed by the user and the computer.

2. **Adjusting the Board Size**: The program correctly adjusts the board size `n` by subtracting 2 for each move where the coordinates are different (`a != b`) and subtracting 1 for each move where the coordinates are the same (`a == b`). This adjustment is necessary because each move eliminates two potential rook placements (one for the user and one for the computer).

3. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` calculates the number of possible final configurations using dynamic programming. The base cases are correctly initialized as `[1, 1]`. The recurrence relation used in the loop is correct: `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i-2]) % (10^9 + 7)`. This formula accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on an `i x i` board without them attacking each other, considering the previous configurations.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The use of modulo `10^9 + 7` ensures that the result fits within standard integer limits and handles large numbers appropriately.

5. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the result for each test case by calling `func_1(n)` and printing the result.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
