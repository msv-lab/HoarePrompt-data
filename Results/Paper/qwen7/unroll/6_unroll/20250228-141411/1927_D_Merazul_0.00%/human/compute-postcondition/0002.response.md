The loop condition is `t`. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be non-zero (i.e., `t` must be greater than 0).

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is reduced to a single integer from the input using the function R.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
- `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5.

The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we need to ensure `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
