Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the maximum possible value that can be achieved by repeatedly applying a specific operation to make all elements of the array equal.
- The given solution attempts to find the second smallest number among every group of three consecutive numbers in the array (excluding the last two if `n` is not divisible by 3). This approach is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the operation of setting all elements in a subarray to the median of that subarray.
- The solution assumes that the maximum value will be the second smallest number among every group of three consecutive numbers, which is not necessarily true. The actual maximum value could be any number that appears frequently enough in the array to eventually dominate all other numbers through the allowed operations.
- The solution does not handle the case where the entire array can be made uniform by setting all elements to the median of the entire array or a subset of the array.

Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly implement the required logic to find the maximum possible value that can be achieved by making all elements of the array equal using the specified operations.
