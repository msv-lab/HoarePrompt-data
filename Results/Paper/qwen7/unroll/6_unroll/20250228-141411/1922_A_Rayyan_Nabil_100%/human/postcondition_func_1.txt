The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters). It then calls another function `func_1` with these inputs and stores the result. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, one per line.
