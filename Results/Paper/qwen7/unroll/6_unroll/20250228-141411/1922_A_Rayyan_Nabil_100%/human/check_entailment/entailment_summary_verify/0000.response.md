### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the problem statement carefully.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
- Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
- String `c` does not match the template `t`.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```
- This function checks if there is any position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]`.
- If such a position is found, it returns 'YES'.
- If no such position is found, it returns 'NO'.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```
- This function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It calls `func_1` with these inputs and stores the result.
- Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
Consider the example test case:
```
4
2
aa
bb
ab
```
- `a = "aa"`
- `b = "bb"`
- `c = "ab"`

`func_1` will check each position:
- At position 0: `a[0] = 'a'`, `b[0] = 'b'`, `c[0] = 'a'`
  - `a[0] != c[0]` and `b[0] != c[0]` is true.
- At position 1: `a[1] = 'a'`, `b[1] = 'b'`, `c[1] = 'b'`
  - `a[1] != c[1]` and `b[1] != c[1]` is true.

Since both positions satisfy the condition, `func_1` returns 'YES'. This is correct because:
- Both `a` and `b` match the template "AA" or "BB".
- `c` does not match either "AA" or "BB".

#### Correctness Verification:
The original assessment stated that the function only checks if there is at least one position where both `a` and `b` do not match `c`, which is not sufficient. However, upon closer inspection, the function `func_1` actually checks if there is any position where both `a` and `b` do not match `c`. If such a position exists, it means that for that position, the characters in `a` and `b` can be the same, and the character in `c` can be different, satisfying the conditions for a valid template.

Thus, the function `func_1` correctly identifies if there is a valid template `t` that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic required to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not.
