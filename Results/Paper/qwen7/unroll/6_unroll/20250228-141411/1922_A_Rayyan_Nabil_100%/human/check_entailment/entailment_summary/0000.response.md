Reasoning:
1. The problem requires checking if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it, but string `c` does not.
2. The `func_1` function is designed to check if for every character in `a` and `b`, the corresponding character in `c` is either different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]` or matches one of them. This is a simplified approach to check if `c` could potentially be a non-matching string under some template conditions.
3. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. It only checks if `c` is either equal to `a` or `b`, or if for every index `i`, `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same. This does not fully capture the requirement of the problem where `a` and `b` should match the template and `c` should not.
4. The `func_2` function correctly handles multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case. However, since `func_1` has a flawed logic, the overall solution will not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
