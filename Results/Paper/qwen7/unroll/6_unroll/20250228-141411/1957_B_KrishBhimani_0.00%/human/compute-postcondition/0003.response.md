Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each `t`, there are two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing `t`, `n`, and `k`, and returns a specific outcome based on the values of `n` and `k` for each case.
