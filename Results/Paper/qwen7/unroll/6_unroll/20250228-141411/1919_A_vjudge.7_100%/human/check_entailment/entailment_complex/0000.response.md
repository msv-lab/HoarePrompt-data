Reasoning:
The given program logic checks if the sum of the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`a + b`) is even or odd. Based on the problem statement and the provided examples, the key observation is that if the sum of the coins is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because the parity (even or odd nature) of the total number of coins determines the winner under optimal play.

Let's analyze the logic:
- If `a + b` is even, Bob wins.
- If `a + b` is odd, Alice wins.

This logic aligns with the examples provided:
- When `a + b` is even (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.), Bob wins.
- When `a + b` is odd (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, etc.), Alice wins.

Given that the program correctly implements this logic and the examples match the expected outcomes, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
