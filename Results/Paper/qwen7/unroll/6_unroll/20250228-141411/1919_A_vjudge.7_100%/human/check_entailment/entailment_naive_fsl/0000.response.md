Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules. According to the problem description, the game involves taking turns to either swap wallets or remove a coin from the current wallet, with the player who cannot make a valid move losing. However, the program incorrectly determines the winner based solely on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd. This logic does not account for the sequence of moves and the optimal strategy for each player.

For example, consider the test case `(a, b) = (1, 1)`:
- The program outputs "Bob" because `1 + 1` is even.
- However, according to the game rules, if Alice chooses not to swap wallets in her first move, she will lose immediately since she cannot remove a coin from an empty wallet. Therefore, Bob should win in this case.

Another example is `(a, b) = (1, 4)`:
- The program outputs "Alice" because `1 + 4` is odd.
- However, if Alice swaps wallets in her first move, she will end up with 4 coins, and Bob will be left with 1 coin. Bob will then be forced to swap back, leaving him with 4 coins again, and Alice will continue to remove coins until Bob is left with no coins, making Alice the winner.

These examples demonstrate that the program does not correctly simulate the game and does not handle the optimal strategies for both players.
