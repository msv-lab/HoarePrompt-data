Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game as described. The logic `if a + b & 1 == 0` checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, but this does not accurately determine the winner based on the rules of the game.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the parity of the number of moves each player can make. Each player can make a maximum of `min(a, b)` moves because they remove one coin per turn and cannot make a move if their wallet is empty. The player who makes the last move wins. Therefore, the key observation is that if the total number of moves (`min(a, b)`) is odd, the first player (Alice) wins; otherwise, the second player (Bob) wins.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Determine the winner based on the parity of min(a, b)
        if min(a, b) % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')

func()
```

This version correctly determines the winner based on the optimal strategy for the game.
