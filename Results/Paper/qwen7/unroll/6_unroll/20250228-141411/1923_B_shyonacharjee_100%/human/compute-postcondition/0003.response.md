Output State: The value of `t` will be decremented by 1 after each iteration of the loop. The value of `can_survive` will be either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions inside the loop for each test case. After all iterations, `t` will be 0, and the `can_survive` values for each test case will be printed accordingly.
