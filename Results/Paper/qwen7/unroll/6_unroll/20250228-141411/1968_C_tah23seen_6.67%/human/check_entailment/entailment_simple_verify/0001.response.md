### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating an array \(a\) such that for each \(x_i\), \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) holds true. The constraints and requirements are clear.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the size \(n\) and the array `arr` of length \(n-1\).
   - It calls a function `func_1` to generate the array `ans`.
   - The function `func_1` initializes `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`.
   - For each subsequent element, it tries to compute `ans[i+1]` such that `arr[i] = ans[i+1] \bmod ans[i]`. If the computed value is less than `arr[i]`, it increments `ans[i+1]` until it meets the condition.
   - Finally, it sets the last element `ans[-1]` to ensure the modulo condition is met with the previous element.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` seems to be trying to satisfy the modulo condition by incrementing the value of `ans[i+1]` until it meets the requirement. However, this approach has a flaw.
   - Consider the following example: `arr = [2, 4, 1]`. According to the problem, we need \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2\) and \(a_3 \bmod a_2 = 1\). If we set \(a_1 = 3\), then \(a_2 = 5\) (since \(5 \bmod 3 = 2\)), and \(a_3 = 4\) (since \(4 \bmod 5 = 4\)), but \(4 \bmod 5 \neq 1\). Instead, we need \(a_3 = 9\) (since \(9 \bmod 5 = 4\) and \(4 \bmod 3 = 1\)).
   - The current implementation does not guarantee that the modulo condition will be met for all elements. Specifically, it only ensures that `ans[i+1]` is greater than `arr[i]` but does not ensure that the modulo condition is satisfied.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where `ans[i+1]` might need to be incremented multiple times to meet the condition, but it does not handle the case where the modulo condition cannot be satisfied with the current approach.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the solution based on the problem description. The approach used in `func_1` does not guarantee that the modulo condition will be met for all elements in the array.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
