### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires generating an array \( a \) such that for each \( x_i \), \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) holds true. This means that each \( a_i \) must be chosen such that when divided by \( a_{i-1} \), the remainder is \( x_i \).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size \( n \) and the array \( arr \) of length \( n-1 \).
   - It calls a function `func_1` to generate the array `ans`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`.
   - For each subsequent element, it tries to compute `ans[i+1]` such that `arr[i] = ans[i+1] \bmod ans[i]`. If the computed value is less than `arr[i]`, it increments `ans[i+1]` until it meets the condition.
   - Finally, it sets the last element `ans[-1]` to ensure the modulo condition is met with the previous element.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` seems to be trying to satisfy the modulo condition by incrementing the value of `ans[i+1]` until it meets the requirement. However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation.
   - Consider the following example: `arr = [2, 4, 1]`.
     - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1 = 3`.
     - `ans[1] = arr[0] + ans[0] = 3 + 3 = 6`.
     - `ans[2] = arr[1] + ans[1] = 4 + 6 = 10`.
     - `ans[3] = arr[2] + ans[2] = 1 + 10 = 11`.
   - Here, `ans[2] = 10` and `arr[2] = 1`, but `10 \bmod 10 \neq 1`. This shows that the current implementation does not guarantee the correct modulo condition.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases properly, especially when `arr[i]` is very close to `ans[i]`. The current approach may lead to incorrect results as shown in the example above.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the solution based on the problem description. The logic in `func_1` does not ensure that the modulo condition is satisfied for all elements in the array.

**Final: False**
