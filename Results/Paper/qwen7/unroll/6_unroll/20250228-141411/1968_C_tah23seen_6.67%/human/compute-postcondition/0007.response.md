Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of n-1 integers, and `n`, which is an integer indicating the expected length of the list `arr` plus one. It returns a list `ans` where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each subsequent element, it is the sum of `arr[i]` and the previous element in `ans` until it exceeds `arr[i]`; the last element of `ans` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`.**
