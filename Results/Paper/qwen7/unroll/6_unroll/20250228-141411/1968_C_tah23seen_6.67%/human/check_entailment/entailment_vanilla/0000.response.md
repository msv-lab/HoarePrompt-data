Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating an array `a` such that for each `x_i`, `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true. The constraints and requirements are clear.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` and the array `arr` of length `n-1`.
   - It calls a function `func_1` to generate the array `ans`.
   - The function `func_1` initializes `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`.
   - For each subsequent element, it tries to compute `ans[i+1]` such that `arr[i] = ans[i+1] \bmod ans[i]`. If the computed value is less than `arr[i]`, it increments `ans[i+1]` until it meets the condition.
   - Finally, it sets the last element `ans[-1]` to ensure the modulo condition is met with the previous element.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` seems to be trying to satisfy the modulo condition by incrementing the value of `ans[i+1]` until it meets the requirement. This approach should work because the constraints are small enough (up to 500 for `x_i` and up to 10^9 for `a_i`).
   - The function ensures that `ans[i+1]` is always greater than `arr[i]` by incrementing it when necessary, which is crucial for the modulo operation to hold.
   - The final assignment of `ans[-1]` also ensures that the last element meets the required condition.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where `ans[i+1]` might need to be incremented multiple times to meet the condition.
   - The constraints are within the bounds that the algorithm can handle efficiently.

Conclusion:
The given code appears to correctly implement the solution based on the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**
