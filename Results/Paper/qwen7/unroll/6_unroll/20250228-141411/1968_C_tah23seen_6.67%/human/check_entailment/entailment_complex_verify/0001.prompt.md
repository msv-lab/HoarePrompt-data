You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]

- Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500), and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500. Each element in arr represents x_i, and the length of arr is n-1.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:

    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each subsequent element, it is the sum of `arr[i]` and the previous element in `ans` until it exceeds `arr[i]`.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each subsequent element, it is the sum of `arr[i]` and the previous element in `ans` until it exceeds `arr[i]`; the last element of `ans` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers and an integer `n`. It constructs and returns a new list `ans` where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, and each subsequent element is the sum of `arr[i]` and the previous element in `ans` until it exceeds `arr[i]`. The last element of `ans` is the sum of the second last element and `arr[-1]`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating an array `a` such that for each `x_i`, `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true. The constraints and requirements are clear.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` and the array `arr` of length `n-1`.
   - It calls a function `func_1` to generate the array `ans`.
   - The function `func_1` initializes `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`.
   - For each subsequent element, it tries to compute `ans[i+1]` such that `arr[i] = ans[i+1] \bmod ans[i]`. If the computed value is less than `arr[i]`, it increments `ans[i+1]` until it meets the condition.
   - Finally, it sets the last element `ans[-1]` to ensure the modulo condition is met with the previous element.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` seems to be trying to satisfy the modulo condition by incrementing the value of `ans[i+1]` until it meets the requirement. This approach should work because the constraints are small enough (up to 500 for `x_i` and up to 10^9 for `a_i`).
   - The function ensures that `ans[i+1]` is always greater than `arr[i]` by incrementing it when necessary, which is crucial for the modulo operation to hold.
   - The final assignment of `ans[-1]` also ensures that the last element meets the required condition.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where `ans[i+1]` might need to be incremented multiple times to meet the condition.
   - The constraints are within the bounds that the algorithm can handle efficiently.

Conclusion:
The given code appears to correctly implement the solution based on the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**
