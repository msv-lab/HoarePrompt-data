Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices `M` for each of the `n` days.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `m` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k` because you can't buy more tickets than `m` per day.
   - The list `M` is sorted to facilitate the greedy approach of buying tickets on the cheapest days first.

3. **Calculating the Number of Days Needed:**
   - `q` is calculated as the ceiling of `k / m`. This represents the number of days needed to buy `k` tickets if you buy `m` tickets each day.

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n * m == k`, it means you can buy `k` tickets by purchasing `m` tickets each day for `n` days without any price increase.
     - The cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
     - Here, `N` is the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`.
   - Otherwise, you need to adjust the calculation:
     - `w` is the last element of `N` (the price of the last batch of tickets).
     - `mu` is the number of tickets left after buying `m` tickets each day for `n-1` days.
     - The cost is split into two parts:
       - Cost of buying `mu` tickets on the last day.
       - Cost of buying the rest of the tickets (`n-1` days).

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Sorting and Initial Setup:**
   - Sorting `M` ensures that we buy tickets on the cheapest days first.
   - Setting `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` ensures we don't exceed the daily limit.

2. **Cost Calculation Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the cost when `n * m == k` is correct.
   - The logic for when `n * m != k` also seems correct, but let's verify the details:
     - `w` is the price of the last batch of tickets.
     - `mu` is the number of tickets left to buy.
     - The cost is correctly split into the last day's cost and the cumulative cost of the previous days.

### Verification

Given the problem constraints and the logic in the code, the program appears to correctly handle the scenario where you buy tickets on the cheapest days first and adjust for any remaining tickets. The sorting and splitting logic seem sound.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets under the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
