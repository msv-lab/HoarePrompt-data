Output State: The final state will depend on the inputs provided within each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, `t` integers are read for `L` and `t` integers are read for `M`. The variable `cost` is calculated based on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the sorted list `M`. The exact value of `cost` varies with each input, but it represents the total cost calculated according to the given logic. After all iterations, the final `cost` values from each iteration are printed.
