You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers representing a segment of the input array a, bit is an integer representing the current bit position being considered, and x is an integer representing the favorite number of Yarik.
def find_max(cur_arr, bit):
    if (bit == -1) :
        return len(cur_arr)
        #The program returns the length of the list 'cur_arr'
    #State: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers representing a segment of the input array a, bit is an integer representing the current bit position being considered, and x is an integer representing the favorite number of Yarik. The value of bit is not -1
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
        
    #State: Output State: `xor` is 0, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `new_arr` is a list of integers where each element is the result of the XOR operation on the subarray of `cur_arr` where the specified bit is 0, `thing1` is 0.
    if (xor >> bit & 1) :
        thing1 = -1
    else :
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    #State: Postcondition: `xor` is 0, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `new_arr` is a list of integers where each element is the result of the XOR operation on the subarray of `cur_arr` where the specified bit is either 0 or 1, `thing1` is -1 if the if condition is true (i.e., the bit in `xor` is 1), otherwise `thing1` is the maximum value found in `new_arr` for the bit-1 position.
    if (x >> bit & 1) :
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
        #The program returns the maximum value between the result of find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1) and the length of new_arr.
    else :
        return thing1
        #The program returns -1 if the bit in `xor` is 0, otherwise it returns the maximum value found in `new_arr` for the bit-1 position.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `cur_arr`, a list of non-negative integers, and `bit`, an integer representing the current bit position. It returns the length of the list `cur_arr` in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the maximum value between the result of calling `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`. In Case_3, it returns -1 if the bit is 0; otherwise, it returns the maximum value found in `new_arr` for the bit-1 position.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the length of the list 'cur_arr'

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value between the result of find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1) and the length of new_arr.

Case_3: The program returns -1 if the bit in `xor` is 0, otherwise it returns the maximum value found in `new_arr` for the bit-1 position.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
