Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it calculates the number of screens required based on the values of \(x\) and \(y\), considering certain conditions. The function then prints these calculated numbers of screens, one per line, for all test cases.**
