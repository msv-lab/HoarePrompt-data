Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `result` is a list containing integers calculated based on the input values of `x` and `y` for each iteration of the loop.

The code snippet `print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))` will join the elements of the `result` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`), and then print this string.

Since the exact values of `x`, `y`, and the loop iterations are not specified, we cannot determine the exact content of the `result` list. However, we know that each element in the `result` list is an integer.

Therefore, the output will be a series of integers, each on a new line, from the `result` list.

Output: **a series of integers, each on a new line, from the `result` list**
