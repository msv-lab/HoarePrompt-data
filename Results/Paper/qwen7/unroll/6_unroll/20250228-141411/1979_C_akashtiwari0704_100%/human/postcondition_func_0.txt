The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, an integer `bets` indicating the number of elements in the list `a`, and a list `a` of integers. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`, then modifies each element in `a` by dividing the LCM by itself. It sums these modified values. If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the modified list elements separated by spaces. This process repeats `t` times. The final output is the result of the last iteration of the outer loop.
