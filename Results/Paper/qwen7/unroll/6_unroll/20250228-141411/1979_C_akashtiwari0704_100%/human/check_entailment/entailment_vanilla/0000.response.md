Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a`.

2. **Calculating the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
   - The function `lcm` calculates the least common multiple of the list `a`.
   - This is done using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.

3. **Distributing Coins:**
   - For each outcome, the program calculates the required bet amount as `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the LCM of all multipliers.
   - It then sums up these bet amounts to check if the total bet is less than or equal to `prod`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - If the total bet (`sumo`) is greater than or equal to `prod`, the program prints `-1` indicating no feasible solution.
   - Otherwise, it constructs and prints the bet distribution.

### Correctness Analysis

#### Key Points:
- **Largest Bet Calculation:** The bet for each outcome is calculated as `prod // a[i]`. This ensures that the bet is the largest possible value while still being an integer.
- **Sum Check:** The sum of these bets is checked against `prod`. If the sum is less than `prod`, it means the total bet is strictly less than the total winnings for any winning outcome.
- **Feasibility:** The program correctly identifies when a solution is impossible by checking if the sum of bets exceeds `prod`.

#### Potential Issues:
- The approach seems sound, but we need to ensure that the bet values do not exceed the upper limit of \(10^9\).
- The calculation of `prod` should handle large numbers properly to avoid overflow.

### Testing the Program with Provided Examples

Let's test the program with the provided examples to verify its correctness:
