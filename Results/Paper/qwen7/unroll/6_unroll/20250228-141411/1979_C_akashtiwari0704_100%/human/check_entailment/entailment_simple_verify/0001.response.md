### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness and address any potential issues.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a`.

2. **Calculating the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
   - The function `lcm` calculates the least common multiple of the list `a`.
   - This is done using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.

3. **Distributing Coins:**
   - For each outcome, the program calculates the required bet amount as `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the LCM of all multipliers.
   - It then sums up these bet amounts to check if the total bet is less than or equal to `prod`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - If the total bet (`sumo`) is greater than or equal to `prod`, the program prints `-1` indicating no feasible solution.
   - Otherwise, it constructs and prints the bet distribution.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Integer Overflow:**
   - The LCM calculation could potentially lead to an overflow if the product of the multipliers is very large. However, since the maximum value of `k_i` is 20 and the maximum number of outcomes `n` is 50, the LCM will not exceed \(20^{50}\), which is a very large number but still manageable within the limits of Python's integer type.

2. **Bet Values:**
   - The bet for each outcome is calculated as `prod // a[i]`. This ensures that the bet is the largest possible value while still being an integer.
   - The sum of these bets is checked against `prod`. If the sum is less than `prod`, it means the total bet is strictly less than the total winnings for any winning outcome.

3. **Feasibility Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies when a solution is impossible by checking if the sum of bets exceeds `prod`.

### Testing the Program with Provided Examples:

Let's test the program with the provided examples to verify its correctness:

   - Expected Output:
     ```
     27 41 12 
     1 1 
     -1
     ```

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input:

     9 4 6 8 3
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
     -1
