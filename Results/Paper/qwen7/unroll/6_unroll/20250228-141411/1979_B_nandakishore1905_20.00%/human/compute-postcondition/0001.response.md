Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions given in the loop body. For each test case, the output will be one of the following:

- If `k` (which is `abs(n - m)`) is a power of 2, it will print `k`.
- If `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, it will print `1`.
- If `n` is 0 and `m` is even, it will print `2`.
- Otherwise, it will print `k - 2^(p-1)`, where `p` is the number of digits in the binary representation of `k`.

Each line of the output corresponds to the result of one test case from the input.
