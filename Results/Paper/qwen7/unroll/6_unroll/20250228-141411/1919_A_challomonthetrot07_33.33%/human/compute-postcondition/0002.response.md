Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'Alice' or 'Bob', depending on the input values provided for each iteration of the loop. The exact sequence of 'Alice' and 'Bob' will vary based on the specific inputs given for each pair (a, b) within the range of T. Since the exact inputs are not specified, the output cannot be precisely determined without those inputs.
