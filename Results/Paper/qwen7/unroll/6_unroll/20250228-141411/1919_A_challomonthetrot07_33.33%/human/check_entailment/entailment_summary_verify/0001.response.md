### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the problem description using the provided function summary.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - If `a` equals `b`, it prints "Bob". This is correct because if both have the same number of coins, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he wins.
   
3. **Single Coin Condition**:
   - If `a` is 1, it prints "Alice". This is correct because if Alice has 1 coin and Bob has any number of coins, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets and then removing the last coin.
   
4. **Single Coin for Bob**:
   - If `b` is 1, it prints "Bob". This is correct because if Bob has 1 coin and Alice has any number of coins, Bob can force Alice into a losing position by swapping wallets and then removing the last coin.
   
5. **Odd Number of Coins for Alice**:
   - If `a` is odd, it prints "Bob". This is correct because if Alice has an odd number of coins, she can always force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets and then removing the last coin, leaving Bob with an even number of coins.
   
6. **Even Number of Coins for Alice and Odd Number of Coins for Bob**:
   - If `a` is even and `b` is odd, it prints "Alice". This is correct because if Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets and then removing the last coin, leaving Bob with an even number of coins.
   
7. **More Coins for Alice**:
   - If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints "Bob". This is correct because if Alice has more coins than Bob, she can always force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets and then removing the last coin, leaving Bob with fewer coins.
   
8. **Else Case**:
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "Alice". This is correct because if none of the above conditions hold, the remaining cases imply that Alice has fewer coins than Bob and an even number of coins, which means Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by swapping wallets and then removing the last coin.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic in the "Else Case". The program does not account for the optimal strategy when `a` is even and `b` is even. Specifically, if both `a` and `b` are even, the game can be analyzed differently. Let's consider the following scenario:

- If both `a` and `b` are even, Alice can always swap wallets and remove a coin, leaving Bob with an even number of coins. However, since both are even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he wins if Alice starts with the first move.

Given this, the program should handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even differently. The correct logic would be to print "Bob" in such cases.

### Corrected Program Logic

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Final Evaluation

The original assessment missed the case where both `a` and `b` are even. With the corrected logic, the program now handles all cases correctly.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
