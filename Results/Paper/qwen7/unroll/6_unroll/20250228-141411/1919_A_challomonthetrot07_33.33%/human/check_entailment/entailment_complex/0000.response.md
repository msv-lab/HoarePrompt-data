Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided solution, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the function matches the optimal strategy for the game described.

### Game Analysis:
- **Turns and Moves**: Players take turns, with Alice starting. Each turn involves choosing to swap wallets or not, followed by removing one coin from the current wallet (if non-empty).
- **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a move loses.
- **Optimal Strategy**: Given the nature of the game, the key observation is that the player who faces a situation where their wallet has exactly 1 coin left can force a win by swapping wallets and then removing the last coin. This is because after swapping, the opponent will face an empty wallet and lose.

### Conditions in the Code:
1. **If `a == b`:**
   - Print 'Bob'. This is correct because if both wallets have the same number of coins, the player whose turn it is can always mirror the opponent's moves, leading to a forced win for the opponent (Bob).

2. **If `a == 1`:**
   - Print 'Alice'. This is correct because Alice can immediately remove the last coin and win.

3. **If `b == 1`:**
   - Print 'Bob'. This is correct because Bob can swap wallets and then remove the last coin, forcing Alice to lose.

4. **If `a % 2 == 1`:**
   - Print 'Bob'. This is correct because if `a` is odd, Alice will eventually face a situation where she has 1 coin left, allowing Bob to force a win.

5. **If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`:**
   - Print 'Alice'. This is correct because if `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice can always ensure that she leaves Bob with an odd number of coins, forcing Bob into a losing position.

6. **If `a > b`:**
   - Print 'Bob'. This is correct because if `a` is greater than `b`, Alice can always swap wallets and force Bob into a losing position.

7. **Otherwise:**
   - Print 'Alice'. This is correct because any other scenario leads to Alice having a winning strategy.

### Conclusion:
The conditions in the code correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game. Therefore, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
