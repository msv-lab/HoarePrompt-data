State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, input value must be greater than 0, `i` is 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
- The loop condition is based on the input value, which is converted to an integer using `int(input())`.
- For the loop to execute, the input value must be greater than 0.
- The initial values of `a` and `b` do not affect the loop's execution condition, but they are part of the overall program state.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` (set to 0), the input value (must be greater than 0), and the initial values of `a` and `b` remain as given.
