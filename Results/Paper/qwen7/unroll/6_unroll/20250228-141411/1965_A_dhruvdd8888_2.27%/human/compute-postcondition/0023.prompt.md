You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents the initial number of stones in each pile, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = set(input().split())
    nums = sorted(map(int, nums))
    if (len(nums) == 1) :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program prints 'Alice'
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and the length of `nums` is not equal to 1
    if (len(nums) == 2) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program prints 'Bob'
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and the length of `nums` is greater than 2
    nums.insert(0, 0)
    cd = 0
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1:
            cd += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `cd` is the number of consecutive pairs of 1 in the list `nums`, starting from the first element up to the second last element. `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` remains the input integer, and `nums` remains a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is now greater than 3.
    if (cd & 1) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program prints 'Bob' and returns None
    else :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program prints 'Alice'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it determines whether 'Alice' or 'Bob' should be printed based on the given conditions. If 'Bob' is printed, the function also returns None.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program prints 'Alice'

Case_2: The program prints 'Bob'

Case_3: The program prints 'Bob' and returns None

Case_4: The program prints 'Alice'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
