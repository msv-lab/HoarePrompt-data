Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `nums`. It then checks the length of `nums` and performs specific operations based on its length. If the length of `nums` is 1, it prints 'Alice'. If the length is 2, it prints 'Bob'. If the length is greater than 2, it inserts a 0 at the beginning of `nums`, counts the number of consecutive pairs of 1s, and based on whether this count is odd or even, it prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. In all cases, the function does not return any value other than printing 'Alice' or 'Bob'.**
