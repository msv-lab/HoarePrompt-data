#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is a string, a and b are lists of integers, n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n and the length of pergunta is n.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `pergunta` is the minimum value obtained by comparing `x + a[i]` for all `i` from `m-1` to `n-1`, and `x` is the cumulative sum of the minimum values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `n-1` to 0.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum value obtained by comparing x + a[i] for all i from m-1 to n-1, and x is the cumulative sum of the minimum values of a[i] and b[i] for all i from n-1 to 0)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two lists of integers `a` and `b` along with indices `n` and `m` to compute a specific value related to these lists. It iterates through the lists from index `n-1` to `m-1`, updating a cumulative sum `x` by adding the minimum of the current elements in `a` and `b`. It also updates a variable `pergunta` to store the minimum value between `x + a[i]` and the current value of `pergunta` for each iteration. Finally, it prints and returns the value of `pergunta`, which represents the minimum value obtained by comparing `x + a[i]` for all `i` from `m-1` to `n-1`.
