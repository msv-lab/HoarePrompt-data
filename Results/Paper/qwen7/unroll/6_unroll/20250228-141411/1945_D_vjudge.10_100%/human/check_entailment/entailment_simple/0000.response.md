Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCasos`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `pergunta` are initialized correctly based on the input.
3. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with the correct parameters.
4. **Function Logic**:
   - The function iterates backward through the list `a` and `b`.
   - It updates `pergunta` to be the minimum value between its current value and `x + a[i]` when `i < m`.
   - It also updates `x` to be the cumulative sum of the minimum values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`.
5. **Output**: The function prints the value of `pergunta`, which is the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend.

Given the logic and the state transitions described, the program appears to follow the correct approach to solve the problem. The function `func_1` correctly implements the algorithm to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions.

Correctness: **True**
