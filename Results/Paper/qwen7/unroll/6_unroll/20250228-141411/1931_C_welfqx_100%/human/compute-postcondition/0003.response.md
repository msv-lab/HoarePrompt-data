Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of n integers a where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for t, n, and a list of integers a. It processes each test case according to the given constraints and returns a result for each one.
