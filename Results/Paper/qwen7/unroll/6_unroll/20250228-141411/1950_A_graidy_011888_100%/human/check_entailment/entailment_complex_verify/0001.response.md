### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case individually. This part of the assessment is accurate.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`. This is correct because the problem specifies that each test case contains three digits separated by spaces. This part of the assessment is also accurate.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met. This is correct according to the problem statement. However, the original assessment did not mention that the condition `a < b < c` should be checked in a single comparison, which could lead to confusion. The condition `a < b < c` is equivalent to `a < b and b < c`, but the original assessment did not explicitly state this equivalence.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b and b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met. This is correct according to the problem statement. The original assessment correctly noted this condition.
5. **Default Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'NONE'. This is correct as per the problem statement. The original assessment correctly noted this as well.

However, the original assessment did not clearly explain the equivalence of the condition `a < b < c` to `a < b and b < c`. While the program works correctly regardless of this detail, it is important to clarify that both forms are equivalent for the purpose of checking if the digits form a stair.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is generally accurate, but it could have been more precise in explaining the equivalence of the condition `a < b < c` to `a < b and b < c`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
