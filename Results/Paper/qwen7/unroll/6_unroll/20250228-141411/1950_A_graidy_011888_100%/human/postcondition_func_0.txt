The function processes `n` sets of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (each between 0 and 9) and outputs one of three strings ('STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE') for each set based on the given conditions. The function does not return any value. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged after the function executes.
