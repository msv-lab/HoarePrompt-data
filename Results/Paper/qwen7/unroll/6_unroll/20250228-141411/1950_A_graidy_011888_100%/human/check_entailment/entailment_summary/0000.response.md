Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the specified conditions. Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Condition Checking**:
   - For each set of digits `(a, b, c)`, it checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if true.
   - If the previous condition is false, it checks if `a < b` and `b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if true.
   - If both conditions are false, it prints 'NONE'.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the program accurately follows the rules for determining whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. There are no logical errors or omissions in the program that would cause it to produce incorrect results based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
