### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the given program is correct. Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `array` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `result` is initialized as an empty list to store the final answers.

2. **Processing Operations**:
   - The function iterates through each operation in `operations`.
   - If the operation type (`op_type`) is 1, it appends the value to `array`.
   - If the operation type is 2, it extends `array` by appending `value` copies of the current `array`.

3. **Handling Queries**:
   - The function iterates through each query in `queries`.
   - For each query, it calculates the index using `(k - 1) % len(array)` to handle the periodic nature of the array due to the repeated extensions.
   - The calculated index is appended to `result`.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the number of operations and queries respectively.
   - It reads the operations and queries as specified.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - Calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
   - Prints the results for each test case.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Operation Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles both types of operations:
     - Appending a single value (type 1).
     - Extending the array by repeating itself multiple times (type 2).

2. **Query Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles queries by considering the periodic nature of the array.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the query index wraps around the current length of the array, which is correct given the way the array grows.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function should handle large values of `k` correctly by wrapping around the array length.
   - The function should handle the case where the array length exceeds the maximum possible value of `k`.

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the `func_1` function. Specifically, the function does not correctly handle the extension of the array when the operation type is 2. The function should extend the array by appending `value` copies of the current `array`, but instead, it appends `value` copies of the individual elements of the current `array`.

For example, consider the following sequence of operations:
- Operation 1: Append 1
- Operation 2: Extend by 2 copies of the current array
- Operation 1: Append 2
- Operation 2: Extend by 3 copies of the current array

The expected array after these operations would be `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2]`. However, the current implementation would produce `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2]`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the function should use:
```python
if op_type == 2:
    array.extend(array * value)
```

### Conclusion

The original assessment was inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the extension of the array when the operation type is 2. The current implementation appends individual elements instead of the entire array.

**Final: False**
