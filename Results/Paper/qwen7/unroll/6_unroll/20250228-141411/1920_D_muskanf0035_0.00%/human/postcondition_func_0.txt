The function accepts parameters `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. `operations` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (`op_type`, `value`), and `queries` is a list of integers `k_i`. The function processes the `operations` to potentially modify an `array`, but since the operations do not add any new elements to the `array`, it remains empty. The function then iterates over the `queries` and appends the same element (which is always the first element due to the empty `array`) to the `result` list for each query. Finally, the function returns an empty list named `result`.
