Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it handles the operations. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the operations as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Operation Handling**: 
   - The code correctly handles appending a single integer (`op_type == 1`).
   - However, when handling the second type of operation (`op_type == 2`), it simply extends the array with its current content repeated `x` times. This is incorrect because the problem specifies that `x` copies of the current array should be appended, not just the current array itself.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - The query handling part uses modulo operation to wrap around the array, which might not give the correct answer if the array has been extended multiple times.

To fix this, we need to maintain a record of the last operation type and the size of the array after each operation. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    last_op_type = None
    last_size = 0
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
            last_op_type = 1
            last_size += 1
        else:
            last_op_type = 2
            last_size *= value
    result = []
    for k in queries:
        if last_op_type == 1:
            result.append(array[(k - 1) % last_size])
        else:
            # Since we know the last operation was a copy, we can use binary search to find the k-th element
            low, high = 0, last_size - 1
            while low <= high:
                mid = (low + high) // 2
                if mid < last_size // value:
                    result.append(array[mid])
                    break
                else:
                    high = mid - 1
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

This corrected version maintains the state of the array and the last operation type, ensuring that the array is correctly simulated according to the problem's requirements.
