Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate two arrays \( l \) and \( r \) such that the bitwise XOR of elements in \( l \) equals the bitwise XOR of elements in \( r \). Specifically, the program attempts to construct \( l \) and \( r \) by directly selecting elements from the given array \( a \), which does not guarantee that the XOR values will match. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
2
4 2
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
6 2
5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2
```

For the first test case, the program outputs:
```
1 2
1 2
```
Here, the XOR of \( l = [1, 2] \) is \( 1 \oplus 2 = 3 \), and the XOR of \( r = [1, 2] \) is also \( 1 \oplus 2 = 3 \). This seems correct.

However, for the second test case, the program outputs:
```
5 1
5 1
```
Here, the XOR of \( l = [5, 1] \) is \( 5 \oplus 1 = 4 \), and the XOR of \( r = [5, 1] \) is also \( 5 \oplus 1 = 4 \). This also seems correct.

But consider another valid solution for the second test case:
```
3 3
3 3
```
Here, the XOR of \( l = [3, 3] \) is \( 3 \oplus 3 = 0 \), and the XOR of \( r = [3, 3] \) is also \( 3 \oplus 3 = 0 \).

The program, however, does not handle this scenario correctly. It constructs \( l \) and \( r \) by directly selecting elements without ensuring the XOR values match for all possible valid pairs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
