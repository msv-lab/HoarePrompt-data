Output State: The output consists of multiple lines, each representing the results of one test case. For each test case, it first prints pairs of numbers that appear exactly twice in the list `a` and have their counts in the list `l` equal to 2, up to `k*2` such pairs. After printing these pairs, it prints the remaining numbers from the list `res`, which are the numbers that appeared once in the first half of the list `a` and are needed to reach `2*k - ul` unique numbers. Finally, it prints any pairs of numbers from the second half of the list `a` that have their counts in the list `r` equal to 2, until `ul` equals `ur`. Each line ends with a space-separated list of numbers printed during the test case.
