The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates a value \( s \) based on the number of edges \( m \), the sum of edge weights \( a \), and a modular inverse \( c \). The final value of \( s \) is computed as the sum of \( c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a \) for \( i \) ranging from 0 to \( k-1 \), and then taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). The function outputs the calculated value \( s \) for each test case.
