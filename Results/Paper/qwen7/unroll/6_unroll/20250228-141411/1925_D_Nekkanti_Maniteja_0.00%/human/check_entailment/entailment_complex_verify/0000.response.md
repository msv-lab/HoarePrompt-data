### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Friendship Value Update**: If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
2. **Expected Value Calculation**: We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
3. **Modular Arithmetic**: The final result should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `c` is the modular inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `s` is initialized to 0.
   - `a` is initialized to 0 and accumulates the sum of friendship values for all pairs of friends.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are read.
   - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - `a` is updated with the sum of friendship values for all pairs of friends.
   - In the loop for `k` excursions, `s` is updated using the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
- The annotated code explains that the program calculates a value \(s\) based on the number of edges \(m\), the sum of edge weights \(a\), and a modular inverse \(c\).
- The final value of \(s\) is computed as the sum of \(c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a\) for \(i\) ranging from 0 to \(k-1\), and then taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Correctness Analysis:
- **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The modular inverse \(c\) of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) is used to normalize the expected value calculation. This is correct because it accounts for the total number of possible pairs.
- **Summation of Friendship Values**: The variable `a` correctly accumulates the sum of friendship values for all pairs of friends.
- **Expected Value Calculation**: The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is used to update `s` for each excursion. However, this formula does not correctly represent the expected value calculation.

#### Expected Value Calculation:
To correctly calculate the expected value, we need to consider the probability of selecting each pair of friends and how their friendship value evolves over the k excursions. The correct approach involves calculating the expected increase in friendship values for each pair of friends and summing these expectations.

Given the complexity of the problem, the provided program does not correctly implement the expected value calculation. The formula used in the program does not reflect the true expected value of the sum of friendship values.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

**Final: False**
