Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( T \).
2. For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), and the array \( a \).
3. The array \( a \) is split into two halves: the left half (`lft`) and the right half (`rgt`).
4. The program then sorts the left and right halves.
5. It identifies repeated and unique elements in the left half and processes them to form pairs and single elements.
6. It ensures that no more than \( k \) elements are printed per line.
7. The same process is applied to the right half.
8. However, the logic for forming the final output arrays \( l \) and \( r \) is flawed. The program does not ensure that the XOR of elements in \( l \) equals the XOR of elements in \( r \).

Given the problem statement, the program should ensure that the XOR of elements in \( l \) (subset of the first half) equals the XOR of elements in \( r \) (subset of the second half). The current implementation does not guarantee this property.

Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as stated because it does not ensure that the XOR of the elements in \( l \) equals the XOR of the elements in \( r \).
