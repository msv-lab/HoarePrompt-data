Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( T \).
2. For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), and the array \( a \) of length \( 2n \).
3. The array is split into left (`lft`) and right (`rgt`) halves.
4. The program then processes the left half to identify repeated and unique elements:
   - Repeated elements are stored in `ldb`.
   - Unique elements are stored in `sng`.
5. The program prints pairs of repeated elements from the left half until \( k \) elements are printed.
6. If fewer than \( k \) repeated elements are available, it prints unique elements from the left half.
7. The same process is applied to the right half to ensure the XOR of the selected elements from both halves are equal.
8. The program ensures that no more than \( k \) elements are printed per line.

Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, the program appears to follow the requirements correctly. It handles the sorting and selection of elements from the left and right halves appropriately to meet the XOR condition.

Correctness: **True**
