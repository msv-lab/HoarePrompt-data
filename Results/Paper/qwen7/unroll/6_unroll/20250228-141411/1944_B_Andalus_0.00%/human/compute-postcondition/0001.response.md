State: **`T` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 5000, _ is now 1** 

Explanation:
- The variable `_` is used as a placeholder in the `for` loop and is automatically incremented with each iteration. It does not need to be explicitly set to a specific value before the loop starts; it will be 1 at the start of the first iteration.
- The variable `T` is the only variable mentioned in the loop head that needs to be considered. Since the loop depends on the value of `T`, `T` must be within the specified range (1 ≤ T ≤ 5000) for the loop to execute.
