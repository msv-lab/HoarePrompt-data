Output State: **`T` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 5000.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since `T` was initially a positive integer between 1 and 5000, the new state maintains this condition. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
