Output State: **`output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, but in reverse order; `output2` is a list containing all corresponding quotients for each divisor in the reversed `output1`.**

Explanation: The code `output1.reverse()` reverses the list `output1`. This means that while the elements of `output1` remain the same, their order is now reversed. The value of `output2` remains unchanged because it was not affected by the operation.
