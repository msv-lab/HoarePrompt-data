You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))
    print(len(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list. This list contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, listed in reverse order, followed by their corresponding quotients.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `x`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It iterates from 1 to the square root of `x`, checks for divisors, and appends them to the list.
   - The list is then reversed and returned.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program checks if `(n + x - 2)` is even. If it is, it calls `func_1(n + x - 2)` and processes the results.
   - Similarly, it checks if `(n - x)` is even. If it is, it calls `func_1(n - x)` and processes the results.
   - For each divisor `s` obtained from `func_1`, it checks if `(s + 2)` is even and if `(s + 2) / 2` is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - Valid divisors are added to the `output` list.
   - Finally, the program prints the length of the unique elements in the `output` list.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Divisor Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of a number `x` and returns them in ascending order.
   - This is used to find possible values of `k` by checking conditions related to `x`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` ensures that `s + 2` is even, which implies `s` is even.
   - The condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` ensures that the value derived from `s` meets the requirement of the problem statement.

3. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over `t` and processing each one separately.
   - It uses sets to ensure uniqueness of the results before printing the count.

### Edge Cases and Constraints:

- The constraints `1 <= t <= 100`, `1 <= x < n <= 10^9` are handled appropriately.
- The logic correctly identifies valid `k` values based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately calculates the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
