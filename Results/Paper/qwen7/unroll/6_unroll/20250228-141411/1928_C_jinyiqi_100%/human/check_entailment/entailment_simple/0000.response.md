### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the settling pattern matches the given position \( n \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If \( k \) is even, the sequence will alternate between increasing and decreasing segments.
   - If \( k \) is odd, the sequence will be strictly increasing or decreasing depending on the starting point.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly identifies potential \( k \) values by checking divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - The function `func_1` finds all divisors of a given number and returns them in a specific order.
   - The main loop checks if the divisors satisfy the conditions to be valid \( k \) values.

4. **Detailed Breakdown**:
   - **Condition Checking**:
     - For each divisor \( s \) of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \), it checks if \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \). This ensures that the number \( x \) falls within the valid range for the given \( k \).
   - **Set Conversion**:
     - Using a set to eliminate duplicate values ensures that each \( k \) is counted only once.
   - **Output Calculation**:
     - The length of the set gives the number of valid \( k \) values.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where \( k = 1 \) is explicitly excluded since the settling does not exist for \( k = 1 \).

6. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly finds all divisors of a number and returns them in a concatenated form of quotients and divisors.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid \( k \) values based on the given constraints. The code accurately processes the input and outputs the correct number of valid \( k \) values for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
