Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0, as is typical for a `range` function starting from 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

4. **Check the state of `costs` and `k`**: Since `costs` is a list of length `n` and `k` is a constant or variable, we need to ensure that `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is a positive integer to allow the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `i` starts at 0 and that `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is a positive integer. 

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and the expression `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be a positive integer**
