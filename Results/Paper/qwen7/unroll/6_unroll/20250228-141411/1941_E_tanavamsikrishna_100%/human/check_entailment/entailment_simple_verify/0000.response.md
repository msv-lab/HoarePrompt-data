### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The function initializes the first element of the row to 1.
   - It then increments the next `d-1` elements by 2.

2. **Min-Heap Initialization**:
   - A min-heap is created using the first `d` elements of the row.
   - This ensures that the smallest element in the initial segment is tracked.

3. **Heap Operations**:
   - For each element from `d` to the end of the row, the function pops the smallest element from the heap.
   - If the popped element's index is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`, it is ignored.
   - Otherwise, the element is updated by adding 1 to the cost and reinserted into the heap twice.

4. **Heap Property Maintenance**:
   - The heap is maintained to ensure the smallest element is always at the root.
   - Elements are reinserted to update the cost and maintain the heap property.

However, there are several issues with this approach:

- **Incorrect Distance Constraint Handling**: The function does not ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. The logic for updating the heap and placing supports does not correctly enforce this constraint.
- **Heap Operations**: The while loop inside the heap operations does not correctly handle the removal of outdated elements from the heap, leading to incorrect support placements.
- **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases where the row might have varying depths and the distance constraint needs to be strictly followed.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function reads the dimensions of the grid and the depths of the cells for each row.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to get the cost of placing supports.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum cost among them.

3. **Output**:
   - The minimum total cost is printed.

Given the issues identified in `func_1`, the overall approach of `func_2` is flawed because it relies on an incorrect cost calculation method.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges. The issues in `func_1` lead to incorrect support placements and cost calculations, which in turn affect the final result in `func_2`.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
