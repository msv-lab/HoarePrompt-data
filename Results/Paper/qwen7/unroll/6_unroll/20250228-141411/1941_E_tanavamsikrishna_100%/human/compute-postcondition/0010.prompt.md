You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of integers representing the depths of the river cells in a row, and d is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports.
def func_1(row, d):
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2
        
    #State: Output State: row is a list of integers where the first element is 1 and each subsequent element (from index 1 to d-1) is 2 more than its initial value. For example, if d is 4, then row will be [1, 3, 5, 7].
    min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
            pass
        
        row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
        
        heappush(min_heap, e)
        
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
        
    #State: A modified version of the original `row` list where for each element at index `i` (where `i >= d`), it has been incremented by 1 if the smallest element in the min-heap (considering elements from `row[:d]` and their indices) whose index is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)` has been popped and then reinserted into the heap twice. The min-heap property is maintained throughout the process.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the modified `row` list, where for each element at index `i` (where `i >= d`), it has been incremented by 1 if the smallest element in the min-heap (considering elements from `row[:d]` and their indices) whose index is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)` has been popped and then reinserted into the heap twice.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `row`, a list of integers representing the depths of river cells, and `d`, a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports. It returns the last element of the modified `row` list, where for each element at index `i` (where `i >= d`), it has been incremented by 1 if the smallest element in the min-heap (considering elements from `row[:d]` and their indices) whose index is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)` has been popped and then reinserted into the heap twice.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the last element of the modified `row` list, where for each element at index `i` (where `i >= d`), it has been incremented by 1 if the smallest element in the min-heap (considering elements from `row[:d]` and their indices) whose index is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)` has been popped and then reinserted into the heap twice.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
