Output State: **`costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`. `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `func_1` are unchanged.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list called `costs` using a list comprehension. Each element in `costs` is the result of calling the function `func_1` with arguments `row` and `d` for each row in the list `rows`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows` remain unchanged. The function `func_1` is applied to each row in `rows` with the parameter `d`, and the results are stored in the `costs` list.
