Let's break down the problem and the solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown:
- **Objective**: Minimize the total cost of installing supports for \( k \) bridges on consecutive rows.
- **Constraints**:
  - \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 100 \)
  - \( 3 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \)
  - \( 1 \leq d \leq m \)
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - Cost to install a support in cell \((i, j)\) is \( a_{i,j} + 1 \).
  - Supports must be installed in the first and last columns of each row.
  - Distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than \( d \).

### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- **Purpose**: Calculate the minimum cost to install supports in a single row.
- **Algorithm**:
  - Initialize the first support at the first column with a cost of 1.
  - For each subsequent column up to \( d \), add 2 to the previous support's cost.
  - Use a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of supports within the required distance \( d \).
  - For columns beyond \( d \), update the heap to ensure the minimum cost is maintained.

### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- **Purpose**: Calculate the minimum total cost for \( k \) bridges on consecutive rows.
- **Algorithm**:
  - Read the dimensions and input matrix from the input.
  - Compute the cost for each row using `func_1`.
  - Find the minimum total cost by considering all possible starting rows for the \( k \) bridges.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Heap Usage in `func_1`**:
   - The heap is used to efficiently find the minimum cost of supports within the required distance \( d \).
   - This ensures that the cost calculation adheres to the constraints of the problem.

2. **Cost Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The initial cost setup and the heap operations are correctly implemented to maintain the minimum cost.
   - The logic for updating the heap and calculating the cost is sound.

3. **Cost Calculation in `func_2`**:
   - The function reads the input correctly and computes the cost for each row.
   - It then finds the minimum total cost for placing \( k \) bridges on consecutive rows.
   - The sliding window approach to find the minimum total cost is correct.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the functions and their implementations, the program appears to correctly solve the problem according to the given constraints and requirements.

**Correctness: True**
