The function accepts a list of integers `row` representing the depths of river cells and a positive integer `d` representing the maximum distance between supports. It modifies the `row` list such that for each element at index `i` (where `i >= d`), it increments the element by 1 if the smallest element in a min-heap (consisting of elements from `row[:d]` and their indices) whose index is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)` has been popped and then reinserted into the heap twice. Finally, it returns the last element of the modified `row` list.
