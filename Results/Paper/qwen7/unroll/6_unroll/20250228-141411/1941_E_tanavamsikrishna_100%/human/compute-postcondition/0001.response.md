Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces; `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells.**

Explanation: The code reads an input which is split into space-separated values and assigns these values to `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. It then creates a list called `rows` which consists of `n` lists, each containing `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows` are updated accordingly, but the initial conditions for `k` and `d` remain unchanged. The output state reflects these changes.
