You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and for each test case, the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents the integers on the cards in your hand, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice.
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and for each test case, the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents the integers on the cards in your hand, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice. After executing the loop, the value of t remains unchanged, and for each test case, the output is the count of duplicate integers in the input line.
    #
    #The loop processes every second line starting from the third line of the input file (skipping the first two lines). For each processed line, it calculates the number of duplicate tokens (integers) by comparing the length of the split tokens list with the length of the set of those tokens. The result for each line is printed but does not affect the input state.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a list of integers representing cards in a hand. It returns a specific value based on the conditions given, such as the count of unique integers appearing at most twice within the range 1 to n, where n is the length of the list and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. For each test case, t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of such lists to process.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
