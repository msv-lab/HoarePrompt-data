Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and for each test case, the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents the integers on the cards in your hand, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice. After executing the loop, the value of each a_i remains unchanged, but the loop prints the count of duplicate integers for each test case.

In simpler terms: The number of times each card appears more than once is printed for each test case, but the actual numbers on the cards do not change.
