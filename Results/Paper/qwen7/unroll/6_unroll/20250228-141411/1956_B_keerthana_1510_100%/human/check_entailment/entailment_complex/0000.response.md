Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem described. The function is designed to count the number of duplicate integers in each line of the input file, which is not relevant to the game described. Specifically, the function does not simulate the game or account for the strategic moves of Nene, nor does it calculate the maximum number of points you can get.

The function should instead:
1. Read the input for each test case.
2. Simulate the game by considering the optimal strategy of Nene.
3. Calculate the maximum number of points you can get by making optimal choices.

The current implementation simply counts duplicates, which is irrelevant to the game logic and does not provide the required output.

Correctness: **False**
