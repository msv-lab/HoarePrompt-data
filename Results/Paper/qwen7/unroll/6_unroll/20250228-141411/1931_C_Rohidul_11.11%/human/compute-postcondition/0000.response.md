Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder and typically discarded. However, the loop itself depends on the value returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The loop will execute based on the input provided by `int(input())`.
   - We need to ensure that the input provided is valid according to the constraints given.

3. **Constraints Analysis:**
   - `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For each test case, `n` (the number of elements in the array) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - The array `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
   - The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range for `t`.
   - The initial state of `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute correctly is the value of `t` to ensure it falls within the valid range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
