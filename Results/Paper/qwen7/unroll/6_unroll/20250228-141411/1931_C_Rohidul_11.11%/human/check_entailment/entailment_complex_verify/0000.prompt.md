You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. After executing the loop, ans is an integer representing the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing elements from both ends of array a such that no two adjacent elements in the subarray are equal. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. It then determines the maximum length of a subarray that can be obtained by removing elements from both ends of the list \( a \) such that no two adjacent elements in the subarray are equal. If no such subarray exists, it returns 0. The function prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the array has multiple segments of different values that need to be merged into a single segment. Here's an example:

Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The program will incorrectly calculate the minimum cost as 4, but the correct answer is 3. This is because we can merge the entire array into a single segment by setting all elements to the most frequent element (which is 1 in this case), resulting in the array becoming `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` with a cost of 3 burles.

The program only considers merging from the start or the end of the array and does not account for merging segments in the middle. Therefore, it does not cover all possible scenarios to achieve the minimum cost.
