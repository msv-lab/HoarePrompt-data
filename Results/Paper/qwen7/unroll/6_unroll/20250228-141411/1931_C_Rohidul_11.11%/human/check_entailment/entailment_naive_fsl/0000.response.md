Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the array has multiple segments of different values that need to be merged into a single segment. Here's an example:

Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The program will incorrectly calculate the minimum cost as 4, but the correct answer is 3. This is because we can merge the entire array into a single segment by setting all elements to the most frequent element (which is 1 in this case), resulting in the array becoming `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` with a cost of 3 burles.

The program only considers merging from the start or the end of the array and does not account for merging segments in the middle. Therefore, it does not cover all possible scenarios to achieve the minimum cost.
