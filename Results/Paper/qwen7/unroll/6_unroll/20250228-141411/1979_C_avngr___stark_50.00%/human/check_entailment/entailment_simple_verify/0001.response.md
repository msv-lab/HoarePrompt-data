### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and validate the original assessment:

1. **Computation of Total Bet Amount (`m`):**
   - The program correctly calculates the product `m` of all multipliers `k_i`. This part is correct.

2. **Distribution Calculation:**
   - The program calculates a list `c` where each element is `m / k[i]`. This step is incorrect because the goal is to find a distribution where the sum of the bets is strictly less than `m`, not `m / k[i]`.
   - Specifically, setting each `c[i]` to `m / k[i]` does not ensure that the sum of `c` is strictly less than `m`. Instead, we need to distribute the coins such that the sum of the bets is strictly less than `m`.

3. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The program calls a function `func_1` to compute the GCD of the list `c`. This is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem at hand.
   - After computing the GCD, the program divides each element of `c` by the GCD. This step is also unnecessary and does not contribute to solving the problem correctly.

4. **Validation and Output:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the elements in `c` is greater than or equal to `m / hcf`. If true, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid distribution exists.
   - If false, it prints the elements of `c`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly:
1. Calculate the product `m` of all multipliers `k_i`.
2. Distribute the coins such that the sum of the bets is strictly less than `m`.
3. One simple and valid approach is to set each bet to 1 (or any constant value less than `m / n`).

### Revised Program:
```python
from math import gcd

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = 1
    for i in range(n):
        m *= k[i]
    
    # Distribute 1 coin for each outcome
    c = [1] * n
    
    if sum(c) >= m / n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            print(c[i], end=' ')
        print('')
```

### Validation Using Annotations:
- **Initial State:** `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\). The list `k` contains `n` integers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\) such that \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\) for each \(i\).
- **After calculating `m`:** `m` is the product of all `k_i`.
- **Distribute 1 coin for each outcome:** Set `c` to `[1] * n`.
- **Check sum of `c`:** Check if the sum of `c` is greater than or equal to `m / n`.
- **Output result:** If the sum is greater than or equal to `m / n`, print `-1`. Otherwise, print the elements of `c`.

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical errors and unnecessary steps. A simpler and correct approach would be to distribute 1 coin for each outcome. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
