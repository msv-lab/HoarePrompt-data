Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it calculates the product of all multipliers (`m`), which represents the minimum amount of coins needed to ensure a win for any outcome if we bet the maximum possible amount.
3. It then divides this product by each multiplier to get the corresponding bet amounts (`c`).
4. The function `func_1` correctly computes the GCD of the list `c`, which is used to scale down the bet amounts to their simplest form.
5. After scaling, it checks if the sum of the scaled bet amounts is less than the scaled minimum win amount. If so, it prints the scaled bet amounts; otherwise, it prints `-1`.
6. The logic ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the win amount for any outcome, as required by the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
