Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `numbers` is a list containing n integers k_1, k_2, …, k_n such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for each i, `hcf` is equal to the first element of the list `numbers`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `hcf` to the first element of the list `numbers`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `numbers` remain unchanged from their initial states.
