Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Computation of `m`**: The variable `m` is calculated as the product of all multipliers (`k_i`). This step is necessary to ensure that the total bet is compared against the potential winnings from any single outcome.

3. **Calculation of `c`**: The list `c` is computed as the quotient of `m` divided by each `k_i`. This ensures that if any `k_i` wins, the total bet (`sum(c)`) would be less than the winnings (`m / k_i`).

4. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the GCD of the list `c`. This step is used to simplify the values in `c` while maintaining their relative proportions.

5. **Validation and Output**: The program checks if the sum of the simplified `c` values is less than or equal to the simplified `m / hcf`. If it is, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists. Otherwise, it prints the simplified values of `c`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where a valid distribution exists by ensuring the sum of `c` is strictly less than the simplified `m / hcf`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
