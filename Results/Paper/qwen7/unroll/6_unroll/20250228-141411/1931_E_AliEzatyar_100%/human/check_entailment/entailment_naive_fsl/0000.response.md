Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not handle the game turns and conditions properly. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Game Logic Misunderstanding**: The program attempts to determine the winner based on the total number of digits and the presence of trailing zeros, but it does not simulate the actual game turns where players take turns reversing digits and concatenating numbers.

2. **Incorrect Functionality**: The `func_1` function counts trailing zeros in a number, but this information is not used correctly in the logic to determine the winner. The program does not simulate the game process where Sasha and Anna take turns making moves according to the rules.

3. **Missing Game Simulation**: The program lacks the necessary logic to simulate the game turns and determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy. It simply checks a static condition (total digits and trailing zeros) without considering the dynamic nature of the game.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and thus cannot be considered correct.
