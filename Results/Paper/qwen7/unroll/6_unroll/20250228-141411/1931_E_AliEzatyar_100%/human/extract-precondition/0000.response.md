Precondition: **num is a list of integers where the length of num (n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and each integer (a_i) in the list satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. Additionally, there are t test cases, where the total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and t satisfies 1 <= t <= 10^4. The parameter m for each test case satisfies 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.**
