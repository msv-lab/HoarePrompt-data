Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining the winner based on the rules of the game:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Digits:**
   - The `total_digits` variable should account for the number of digits in each number after reversing the digits of the chosen number. However, the current implementation simply sums the lengths of the strings representing the numbers, which does not reflect the actual digit count after reversal.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to count trailing zeros in a number, but it is not necessary for solving the problem. Instead, the logic should focus on whether the resulting number after Anna's move can be made large enough to force Sasha to lose.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The logic for determining the winner is flawed. The condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:` does not accurately reflect the game's rules. Specifically, it does not consider the strategic moves that Sasha and Anna can make.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the game and consider the optimal moves for both players. Here’s a more accurate approach:

1. **Simulate Moves:**
   - Anna can reverse any number, and Sasha can concatenate two numbers.
   - The key is to determine if Anna can force Sasha into a position where he cannot make a valid move or if Sasha can always make a move to avoid losing.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Anna should aim to leave Sasha with a single number that is less than \(10^m\).
   - Sasha should try to concatenate numbers to form a large number.

Here’s a revised version of the solution:

```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Function to reverse digits of a number
    def reverse_number(num):
        return int(str(num)[::-1].lstrip('0'))

    # Function to check if Sasha can win
    def can_sasha_win(nums, m):
        nums = sorted(nums, reverse=True)
        while len(nums) > 1:
            # Anna's turn: Reverse any number
            nums = [reverse_number(num) for num in nums]
            # Sasha's turn: Concatenate two numbers
            if len(nums) >= 2:
                a, b = nums.pop(), nums.pop()
                nums.append(a * 10**len(str(b)) + b)
        return nums[0] >= 10**m

    # Determine the winner
    if can_sasha_win(array, m):
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'

for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

This solution correctly simulates the game and determines the winner based on the optimal moves for both players.
