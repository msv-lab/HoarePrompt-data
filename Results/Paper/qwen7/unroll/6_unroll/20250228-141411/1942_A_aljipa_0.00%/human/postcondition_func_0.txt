The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it generates and prints a list based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \). If \( k \) equals \( n \), it prints a list of \( n \) ones. If \( k \) equals 1, it prints a list containing numbers from 0 to \( n-1 \). In all other cases, it prints -1.
