Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Statement Analysis:
- We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Calculation Logic:**
   - The program initializes `suma` to 0.
   - It iterates through values of \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x = \left(\frac{a - i(i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\right)\).
   - If \(x > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - It checks if \((a - i(i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i(i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\), and if true, adds 1 to `suma`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of \(x\):**
   - The formula used to calculate \(x\) does not align with the problem requirements.
   - Specifically, \(x = \left(\frac{a - i(i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\right)\) is not relevant to the problem constraints.

2. **Misinterpretation of Conditions:**
   - The program attempts to check conditions related to \(\gcd(a, b)\) but does not correctly implement them.
   - The logic for checking multiples and gcd is flawed and does not match the problem statement.

3. **Unnecessary Complexity:**
   - The current approach uses an incorrect method to count valid pairs, leading to incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we should:
1. Iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\).
2. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. Count the pairs that satisfy the condition.

### Revised Program:
```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the misinterpretation of the conditions and the incorrect calculation of \(x\). The revised approach correctly implements the solution by iterating over all pairs and checking the conditions directly.

**Correctness:** **False**
