Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through possible values of `i` from 1 to `b` and calculating a sum based on the given conditions.
2. However, the logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the conditions specified in the problem statement. Specifically, it uses `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and checks divisibility conditions that do not align with the requirement that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
3. The program's approach to calculating the number of valid pairs is flawed because it does not correctly account for the gcd condition and the multiple condition simultaneously.
4. The example outputs provided do not match the expected results based on the problem statement, indicating that the logic is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly implement the required conditions and produces incorrect results.
