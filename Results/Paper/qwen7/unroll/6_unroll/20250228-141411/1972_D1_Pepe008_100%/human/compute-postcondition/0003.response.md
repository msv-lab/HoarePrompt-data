Output State: The value of `T`, which is the input integer, will determine the number of times the outer loop runs. For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop calculates a sum (`suma`) based on the values of `a` and `b` provided by the user input. After all iterations of the loops are completed, the final value of `suma` minus 2 is printed for each test case. The exact numerical value of the output depends on the specific inputs provided for each test case.
