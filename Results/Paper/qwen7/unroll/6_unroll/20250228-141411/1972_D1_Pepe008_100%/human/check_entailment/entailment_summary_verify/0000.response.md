### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided program is incorrect:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs using a nested loop and a formula that does not correctly implement the problem's conditions.
   - Specifically, the formula inside the loop:
     ```python
     x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
     ```
     This formula does not seem to be related to the problem's requirements. It appears to be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of how to count the valid pairs.

3. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the test case \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
     - Valid pairs should be \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 1)\).
     - The program outputs 3, which is incorrect because it does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) properly.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary states that the function reads test cases, processes them, and prints the result without returning any value. However, this summary does not mention the specific logic used, which is crucial for understanding the correctness of the program.

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The formula used in the program is incorrect and does not accurately count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect based on the provided problem description and the example test case.
