Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The solution only considers the sum of the two largest numbers in the sorted list, but it doesn't ensure that the books are divided into two non-empty piles such that the sum of the highest-numbered books in each pile is maximized.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider all possible ways to split the books into two piles and then choose the split that gives the maximum sum of the highest-numbered books in each pile. The given solution does not explore all possible splits, so it may not always yield the correct result.
