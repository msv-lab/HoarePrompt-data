Reasoning:
- The problem requires Alice to divide the books into two non-empty piles and read the book with the highest number of pages from each pile to maximize the total number of pages read.
- The provided solution sorts the list of book page counts in descending order and then prints the sum of the first two elements. This approach is correct because the two largest numbers in a sorted list (in descending order) will be at the beginning of the list, and their sum will give the maximum possible total number of pages read under the given constraints.
- The solution correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating `t` times, reading the number of books `n` and their respective page counts for each test case, sorting the page counts, and then printing the sum of the two largest values.
- There are no logical errors or missing steps in the provided code that would lead to incorrect results based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
