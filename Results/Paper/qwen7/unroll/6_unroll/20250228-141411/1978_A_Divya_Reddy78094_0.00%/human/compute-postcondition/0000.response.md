Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and now `t` is the integer input by the user.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`, the output state maintains this condition but updates `t` to the specific integer input by the user. All other variables remain in their initial conditions, specifically, no new variables `n` or the list `a` are introduced by this line of code.
