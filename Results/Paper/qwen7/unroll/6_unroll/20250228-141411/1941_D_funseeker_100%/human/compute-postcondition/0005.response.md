Postcondition: **`ans` is a set of integers, each integer being the result of adding or subtracting `r` to or from each element in `ans` modulo `n`. The operations are determined by the value of `c` ('0' or '1'), and `c` is derived from the string returned by `func_1()` split by space. The value 0 is present in the set `ans`**.
