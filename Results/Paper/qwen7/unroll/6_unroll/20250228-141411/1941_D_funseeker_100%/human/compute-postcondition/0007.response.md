Output State: **`ans` is a set of integers, each integer being the result of adding or subtracting `r` to or from each element in `ans` modulo `n`, except 0 which has been removed, and `ans` now contains the additional integer `n`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.add(n)` adds the integer `n` to the set `ans`. The initial state of `ans` is such that each integer is the result of adding or subtracting `r` to or from each element in `ans` modulo `n`, except 0 which has been removed. After executing the code, `n` is added to `ans`, maintaining the properties of the set as described in the initial state.
