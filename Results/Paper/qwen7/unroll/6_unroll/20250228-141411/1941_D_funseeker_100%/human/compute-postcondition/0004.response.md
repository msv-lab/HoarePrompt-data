Output State: **`ans` is a set of integers, each integer being the result of adding or subtracting `r` (where `r` is an integer derived from the loop) to or from each element in `ans` modulo `n`. The operations are determined by the value of `c` ('0' or '1'), and `c` is derived from the string returned by `func_1()` split by space.**

This means that after the loop finishes, `ans` will contain a series of transformed values based on the operations performed in each iteration, with each transformation depending on the current value of `r` and the condition specified by `c`.
