Reasoning:

1. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: Reads a line from standard input and returns it stripped of any trailing whitespace.
   - **func_2()**: Calls `func_1()` and returns an integer value.
   - **func_3()**: Calls `func_1()` and returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the string and converting each substring to an integer.
   - **func_4()**: Processes the game logic and determines the possible players who could have the ball after all throws.

2. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem involves a game where a ball is thrown between players in a circle. The direction and distance of each throw are specified, and the goal is to determine the possible players who could have the ball after all throws.

3. **Function 4 Logic**:
   - Initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - Iterates through each throw, updating the set `ans` based on the distance `r` and direction `c` of the throw.
   - Handles both clockwise (`'0'`) and counterclockwise (`'1'`) directions, including unknown directions (`'?'`).
   - Ensures the set `ans` contains valid player numbers by using modulo `n`.
   - Adjusts the set if `0` is present to include `n` (since `0` modulo `n` is equivalent to `n`).
   - Prints the size of the set and its elements in sorted order.

4. **Edge Cases and Validations**:
   - The logic correctly handles all specified cases, including unknown directions (`'?'`), and ensures the set contains valid player numbers.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the ball can wrap around the circle correctly.
   - The final adjustments ensure that `0` is replaced with `n` if present, maintaining the circular nature of the game.

5. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including different numbers of players, throws, and unknown directions.
   - The function correctly identifies all possible players who could have the ball after all throws.

Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the function `func_4()` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
