### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` and `func_1()`, `func_2()`, and `func_3()` functions.
   - It extracts the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.

2. **Set Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This set will keep track of the possible players who could have the ball after each throw.

3. **Processing Throws**:
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - If the direction is known (`'0'` or `'1'`), it updates the set `ans` accordingly.
   - If the direction is unknown (`'?'`), it considers both possible directions (`'0'` and `'1'`).

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program uses the modulo operation `% n` to handle circular indexing, ensuring that the player number remains within the range `[1, n]`.

5. **Handling Zero**:
   - If the number `0` is in the set after processing all throws, it is replaced with `n`. This ensures that the player number wraps around correctly.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the size of the set and its elements, sorted in ascending order.

Given the detailed function summary and the step-by-step analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and performs the necessary operations to determine the possible players who could have the ball after all the throws.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem.
