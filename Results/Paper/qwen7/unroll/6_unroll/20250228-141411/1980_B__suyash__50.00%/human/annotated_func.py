#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100. a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for all 1 <= i <= n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        b = list(map(int, a.split()))
        
        o = input().split()
        
        n = b[0]
        
        f = b[1]
        
        k = b[2]
        
        if k == n:
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        fav = o[f - 1]
        
        dic = {i: o.count(i) for i in o}
        
        o.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if o.index(fav) > k - 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        l = sorted(list(set(o)), reverse=True)
        
        for i in range(len(l)):
            if fav != l[i]:
                k -= dic[l[i]]
                if k <= 0:
                    print('NO')
                    break
            else:
                k -= dic[l[i]]
                if k < 0:
                    print('MAYBE')
                    break
                else:

    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop. For each input, the program checks if a certain condition is met and prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' based on the logic within the loop. After all iterations, the final printed statement from the last executed iteration is the output state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers t, n, f, k, and a list a of n integers. It checks if t is within the range 1 to 1000. For each valid test case, it determines whether a certain condition is met based on the values of n, f, k, and the elements in list a. If the condition is satisfied, it prints 'YES'; if not, it prints 'NO' or 'MAYBE' depending on the specific circumstances. After processing all test cases, the final printed statement from the last executed iteration is the output state.
