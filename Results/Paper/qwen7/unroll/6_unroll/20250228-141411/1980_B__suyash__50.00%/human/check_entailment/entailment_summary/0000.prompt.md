Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

# Execution Summary:
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers t, n, f, k, and a list a of n integers. It checks if t is within the range 1 to 1000. For each valid test case, it determines whether a certain condition is met based on the values of n, f, k, and the elements in list a. If the condition is satisfied, it prints 'YES'; if not, it prints 'NO' or 'MAYBE' depending on the specific circumstances. After processing all test cases, the final printed statement from the last executed iteration is the output state.
