State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts at 0.
- The loop condition `range(t)` means that the loop will run `t` times, where `t` is the number of iterations.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`. Given that `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, it must be within the range of 1 to 1000 inclusive for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is within the specified range and `i` starts at 0.
