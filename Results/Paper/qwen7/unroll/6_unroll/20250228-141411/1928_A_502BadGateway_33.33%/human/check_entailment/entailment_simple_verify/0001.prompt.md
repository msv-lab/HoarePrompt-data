You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
    #The program returns 'yes' if the value of `b` is even, otherwise it returns 'no'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to check if a rectangle of dimensions `a x b` can be transformed into another rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
3. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` checks if `b` (one of the dimensions of the rectangle) is even. If `b` is even, it returns `'yes'`, indicating that the rectangle can be transformed into another rectangle. Otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

### Analysis of the Function Logic:
- The logic in `func_1` is flawed for the following reasons:
  - The function only checks if `b` is even. However, a rectangle can be transformed into another rectangle even if `a` is even.
  - For example, a `2x6` rectangle can be cut into two `2x3` rectangles and rearranged to form a `4x3` rectangle, which is not covered by checking only `b` being even.
  - Similarly, a `6x3` rectangle can be cut into two `3x3` rectangles and rearranged to form a `6x3` rectangle, but the function would incorrectly return `'no'`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine if a rectangle can be transformed into another rectangle, we need to consider the following conditions:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, the rectangle can always be transformed into another rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, the rectangle cannot be transformed into another rectangle.

### Revised Function:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even, which is insufficient to determine if the rectangle can be transformed into another rectangle. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
