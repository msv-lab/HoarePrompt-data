Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to check if a rectangle of dimensions `a x b` can be transformed into another rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
3. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` checks if `b` (one of the dimensions of the rectangle) is even. If `b` is even, it returns `'yes'`, indicating that the rectangle can be transformed into another rectangle. Otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

### Analysis of the Function Logic:
- The logic in `func_1` is flawed for the following reasons:
  - The function only checks if `b` is even. However, a rectangle can be transformed into another rectangle even if `a` is even.
  - For example, a `2x6` rectangle can be cut into two `2x3` rectangles and rearranged to form a `4x3` rectangle, which is not covered by checking only `b` being even.
  - Similarly, a `6x3` rectangle can be cut into two `3x3` rectangles and rearranged to form a `6x3` rectangle, but the function would incorrectly return `'no'`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine if a rectangle can be transformed into another rectangle, we need to consider the following conditions:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, the rectangle can always be transformed into another rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, the rectangle cannot be transformed into another rectangle.

### Revised Function:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even, which is insufficient to determine if the rectangle can be transformed into another rectangle. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
