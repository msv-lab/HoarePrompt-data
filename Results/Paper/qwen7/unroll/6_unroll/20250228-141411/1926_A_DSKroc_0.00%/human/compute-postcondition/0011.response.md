Functionality: **The function processes a specified number of input strings, each consisting of 5 characters ('A' or 'B'), and counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'. After processing all strings, it prints 'A' if the total count of 'A' characters is greater than the count of 'B' characters; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value but modifies the output based on the comparison between the counts of 'A' and 'B' characters across all input strings.**
