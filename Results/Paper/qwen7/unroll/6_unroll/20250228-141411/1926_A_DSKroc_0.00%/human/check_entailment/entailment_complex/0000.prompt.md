Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string consists of exactly 5 characters where each character is either 'A' or 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is the number of strings processed, `ac` is the total count of 'A' characters across all strings, `bc` is the total count of non-'A' characters across all strings.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is the number of strings processed, `ac` is the total count of 'A' characters across all strings, `bc` is the total count of non-'A' characters across all strings. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, the condition remains unchanged. If `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`, the condition also remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a specified number of input strings, each consisting of 5 characters ('A' or 'B'), and counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'. After processing all strings, it prints 'A' if the total count of 'A' characters is greater than the count of 'B' characters; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value but modifies the output based on the comparison between the counts of 'A' and 'B' characters across all input strings.
