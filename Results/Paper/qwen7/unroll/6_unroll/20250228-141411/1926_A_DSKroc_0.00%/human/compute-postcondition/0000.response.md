Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 32.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 32`, after executing the code, `t` will still be within this range, but its specific value depends on the user's input. The other information about the input string consisting of exactly 5 characters where each character is either 'A' or 'B' remains unchanged and is not affected by the code.
