Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine which character ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in a given string of length 5. The program iterates through each character of the input string, counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', and then prints the more frequent character after processing all test cases. Given the constraints and the example provided, the program works as expected.
