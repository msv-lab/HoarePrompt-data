### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Counting**: For each test case, the program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' using two counters `ac` and `bc`.
3. **Comparison and Output**: After counting the occurrences, the program compares the counts and prints the character that appears more frequently. This part of the logic is also correct.
4. **Edge Cases**: Since the problem specifies that the strings are of length 5 and consist only of 'A' and 'B', there are no edge cases where the counts could be equal (i.e., `ac == bc`), which simplifies the logic.
5. **Distinct Strings**: The problem statement guarantees that all strings in a test are distinct, so the program does not need to handle duplicate strings.

Given these points, the program should work correctly for the given problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
