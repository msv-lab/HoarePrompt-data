Output State: **`max_sum` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray found in `arr`, `arr` is the list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the subarray with the maximum sum found, `segments_variants` is a list of all subarrays that have the maximum sum found during the iterations, `segments_variants` now contains `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the concatenation of `max_segment` and `[len(arr) - 1]` to the list `segments_variants`. This means that `segments_variants` now includes the current `max_segment` plus the length of the array `arr` minus one as a new element. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
