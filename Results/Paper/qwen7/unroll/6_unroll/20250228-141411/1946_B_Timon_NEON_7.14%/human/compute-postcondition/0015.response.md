Postcondition: **`max_sum` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray found in `arr`, `arr` is the list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the subarray with the maximum sum found, `segments_variants` is a list containing `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, `total_max_segment` is the subarray from `segments_variants` with the highest starting index. If `len(total_max_segment) == 1`, then `total_max_segment` is set to `[-1]`.**
