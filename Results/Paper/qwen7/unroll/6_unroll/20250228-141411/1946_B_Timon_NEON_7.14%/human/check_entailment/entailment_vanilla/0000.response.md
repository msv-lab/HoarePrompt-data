Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The key insight is that the maximum sum can be achieved by repeatedly adding the sum of the entire array to itself up to `k` times.
   - If `k` is greater than the length of the array, the sum can be increased by adding the sum of the array multiple times.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It seems to be a helper function for handling the result.
   - **func_2**: This function aims to find the segment with the maximum sum. However, the logic in this function is flawed. It does not correctly handle the merging of segments or the calculation of the maximum segment sum.
   - **func_3**: This function is incomplete and does not seem to contribute to solving the problem.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the sum of the array.
   - Determine the effective number of full array sums that can be added (`k // n`).
   - Add the sum of the array multiplied by the effective number of full sums.
   - If there are remaining operations (`k % n`), add the sum of the array again.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, `func_2` is not implemented correctly and `func_3` is missing.

Correctness: **False**
