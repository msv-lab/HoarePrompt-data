### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its behavior step-by-step using the provided annotations and the example test cases.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\gcd(a, b)} \).
- It correctly computes the LCM, but it doesn't directly help in solving the problem as described.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `k_i` for each outcome.
- It initializes `den` with the first multiplier and iteratively updates `den` by computing the LCM of `den` and each subsequent multiplier.
- After the loop, `den` is set to `den - sum(vprod)`, where `vprod` is a list of integers obtained by dividing `den` by each `k_i`.
- If `den` is non-positive after this subtraction, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the values in `vprod`.

#### Example Test Cases Analysis:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input:
     ```
     3
     3 2 7
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     27 41 12
     ```
   - Explanation:
     - `den` starts as 3.
     - `den` is updated to the LCM of 3 and 2, which is 6.
     - `den` is updated to the LCM of 6 and 7, which is 42.
     - `vprod` is calculated as `[42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7] = [14, 21, 6]`.
     - `den` is set to `42 - (14 + 21 + 6) = 1`.
     - Since `den` is positive, it prints `14 21 6`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input:
     ```
     2
     3 3
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     1 1
     ```
   - Explanation:
     - `den` starts as 3.
     - `den` is updated to the LCM of 3 and 3, which is 3.
     - `vprod` is calculated as `[3 // 3, 3 // 3] = [1, 1]`.
     - `den` is set to `3 - (1 + 1) = 1`.
     - Since `den` is positive, it prints `1 1`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input:
     ```
     5
     5 5 5 5 5
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     -1
     ```
   - Explanation:
     - `den` starts as 5.
     - `den` is updated to the LCM of 5 and 5, which is 5.
     - `den` is updated to the LCM of 5 and 5, which is 5.
     - `den` is updated to the LCM of 5 and 5, which is 5.
     - `den` is updated to the LCM of 5 and 5, which is 5.
     - `vprod` is calculated as `[5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
     - `den` is set to `5 - (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 0`.
     - Since `den` is non-positive, it prints `-1`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input:
     ```
     6
     7 9 3 17 9 13
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071
     ```
   - Explanation:
     - `den` starts as 7.
     - `den` is updated to the LCM of 7 and 9, which is 63.
     - `den` is updated to the LCM of 63 and 3, which is 63.
     - `den` is updated to the LCM of 63 and 17, which is 1071.
     - `den` is updated to the LCM of 1071 and 9, which is 3213.
     - `den` is updated to the LCM of 3213 and 13, which is 3213.
     - `vprod` is calculated as `[3213 // 7, 3213 // 9, 3213 // 3, 3213 // 17, 3213 // 9, 3213 // 13] = [459, 357, 1071, 190, 357, 247]`.
     - `den` is set to `3213 - (459 + 357 + 1071 + 190 + 357 + 247) = 1989`.
     - Since `den` is positive, it prints `459 357 1071 190 357 247`.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input:
     ```
     3
     6 3 2
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     -1
     ```
   - Explanation:
     - `den` starts as 6.
     - `den` is updated to the LCM of 6 and 3, which is 6.
     - `den` is updated to the LCM of 6 and 2, which is 6.
     - `vprod` is calculated as `[6 // 6, 6 // 3, 6 // 2] = [1, 2, 3]`.
     - `den` is set to `6 - (1 + 2 + 3) = 0`.
     - Since `den` is non-positive, it prints `-1`.

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input:
     ```
     5
     9 4 6 8 3
     ```
   - Expected Output:

     8 18 12 9 24
     ```
   - Explanation:
     - `den` starts as 9.
     - `den` is updated to the LCM of 9 and 4, which is 36.
     - `den` is updated to the LCM of 36 and 6, which is 36.
     - `den` is updated to the LCM of 36 and 8, which is 72.
     - `den` is updated to the LCM of 72 and 3, which is 72.
     - `vprod` is calculated as `[72 // 9, 72 // 4, 72 // 6, 72 // 8, 72 // 3] = [8, 18, 12, 9, 24]`.
     - `den` is set to `72 - (8 + 18 + 12 + 9 + 24) = 0`.
     - Since `den` is non-positive, it prints `-1`.

From the analysis, we see that the program correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem statement. It ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
