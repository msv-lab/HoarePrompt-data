Output State: **`den` is equal to `den` - sum(`vprod`), `vprod` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The initial state defines `den` as the result of applying `func_1` successively to the elements of `vals`. The list `vprod` contains elements that are the result of dividing `den` by each corresponding element in `vals`. The code snippet updates `den` by subtracting the sum of `vprod` from its current value. The value of `vprod` itself does not change. Therefore, the updated state is that `den` is now `den - sum(vprod)`, while `vprod` remains as originally defined.
