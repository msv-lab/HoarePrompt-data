Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of `int(input().strip())`, which is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and the precondition that `vals` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20 remains unchanged.**

This means that `N` now holds the integer value entered by the user, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, and the list `vals` is still a list of `N` integers, each satisfying the condition 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20.
