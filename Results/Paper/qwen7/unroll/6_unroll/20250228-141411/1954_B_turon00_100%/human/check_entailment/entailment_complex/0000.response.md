Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
2. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
3. The provided solution iterates through the array and counts the maximum number of consecutive identical elements.
4. If the entire array consists of the same element or if the array has only one element, it prints -1 because removing any element would not change the fact that the array remains beautiful.
5. Otherwise, it prints the count of the maximum number of consecutive identical elements, which indicates the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the beauty of the array.

Given the logic and the constraints, the provided solution correctly implements the required functionality. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
