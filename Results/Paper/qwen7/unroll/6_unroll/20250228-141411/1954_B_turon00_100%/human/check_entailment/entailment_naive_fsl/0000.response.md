Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not account for the condition where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements. Instead, the program counts consecutive elements that are the same and assumes that the minimum number of removals needed is the smallest count of consecutive elements found. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will no longer be beautiful after the specified removals.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The program would output `1`, but the correct output should be `1` because removing the element at index 3 (value 2) makes the array `[1, 2, 1, 1]`, which is no longer beautiful. However, the program does not handle this case correctly, as it only checks for the smallest count of consecutive elements without ensuring that the resulting array is no longer beautiful.

Another example is:
```
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
The program would output `3`, but the correct output should be `3` because removing the first three elements (values 3) makes the array `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is no longer beautiful. The program does not correctly identify that removing these elements is sufficient to break the beauty of the array.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not always produce the correct result for all potential cases.
