Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed as the result of the loop's execution. For each input `n` and array `a`, the program calculates the minimum number of consecutive elements in `a` that are the same, excluding cases where `n` is 1 or all elements are the same. If such a sequence exists, it prints the length of the shortest sequence; otherwise, it prints -1.
