Reasoning:
The provided solution aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. The logic implemented in the function is as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
3. It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and sets `cnt` to 0. `ans` is initialized to `n` (the maximum possible removals).
4. It iterates through the array and counts the consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`. When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` and resets `cnt` to 0.
5. After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with `cnt`.
6. If `n` is 1 or `ans` equals `n`, it prints `-1` because the array cannot be made non-beautiful.
7. Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

However, there are a few issues with this approach:
- The logic to determine if the array can be made non-beautiful is flawed. The current implementation only counts consecutive elements but does not ensure that the array will no longer be beautiful after removing those elements.
- The logic should focus on finding the longest segment of consecutive elements that are the same and then determining if removing elements from other parts of the array can break the beauty condition.

Given these points, let's analyze the provided solution against the problem requirements and expected behavior:

1. The solution correctly identifies segments of consecutive elements.
2. However, it does not ensure that removing elements from other parts of the array can break the beauty condition.
3. The logic to handle the edge cases (when `n` is 1 or all elements are the same) is correct.

To fix the solution, we need to rethink the approach:
- Identify the longest segment of consecutive elements.
- Determine if removing elements from outside this segment can break the beauty condition.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

        max_length = 1
        current_length = 1

        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] == a[i-1]:
                current_length += 1
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            else:
                current_length = 1

        if max_length == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(n - max_length)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version:
- Identifies the longest segment of consecutive elements.
- Determines if the entire array is beautiful (if `max_length == n`).
- Prints the minimum number of elements to remove (`n - max_length`) to make the array non-beautiful.

Given the above analysis and the corrected logic, the original solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
