### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) satisfy the condition that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over each test case using `for _ in range(int(input()))`.
   - Inside the loop, it calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - In `func_1()`, it creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It then reverses every other element in the list `a` (i.e., elements at even indices).

3. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify if the generated permutation satisfies the given condition.
   - Consider a permutation like `[4, 1, 2, 3]` (for \( n = 4 \)). This permutation is generated by reversing every other element in `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - Check the condition for this permutation:
     - For \( i = 1 \) and \( j = 3 \): \( p_1 = 4 \) and \( p_3 = 2 \). \( 4 \) does not divide \( 2 \), and \( p_2 = 1 \) and \( p_4 = 3 \). \( 1 \) divides \( 3 \), but this does not violate the condition since \( p_2 \) and \( p_4 \) are not consecutive.
     - For other pairs, similar checks can be done, and it can be shown that no pair violates the condition.
   - However, consider another permutation like `[2, 1, 4, 3]` (for \( n = 4 \)). This permutation is also generated by reversing every other element in `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - Check the condition for this permutation:
     - For \( i = 1 \) and \( j = 3 \): \( p_1 = 2 \) and \( p_3 = 4 \). \( 2 \) divides \( 4 \), and \( p_2 = 1 \) and \( p_4 = 3 \). \( 1 \) does not divide \( 3 \), so this permutation does not violate the condition.
     - But consider \( i = 2 \) and \( j = 4 \): \( p_2 = 1 \) and \( p_4 = 3 \). \( 1 \) divides \( 3 \), and \( p_3 = 4 \) and \( p_5 \) (which is out of bounds) would not apply here, but the condition is still violated because \( p_2 \) and \( p_4 \) are consecutive and \( 1 \) divides \( 3 \).

4. **General Case**:
   - The permutation generated by reversing every other element does not guarantee that no two consecutive elements in the original sequence will have the divisibility condition satisfied when considering their positions in the new permutation. There are cases where the condition can still be violated.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not always generate a permutation that satisfies the problem's requirements. Specifically, the permutation generated by reversing every other element can still violate the condition for certain values of \( n \).

**Correctness: False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
