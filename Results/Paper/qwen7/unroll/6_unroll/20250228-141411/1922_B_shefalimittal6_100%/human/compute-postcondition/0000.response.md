Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the input reading method is changed to `sys.stdin.read`.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` changes the way input is read from standard input to using `sys.stdin.read`, but it does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or the list `a`. It only updates how the input data will be processed when it is eventually read.
