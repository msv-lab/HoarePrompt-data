State: **`idx` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `results` is an empty list, `_` is the loop variable initialized to 0**.

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Variable Initialization**: The loop variable `_` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts. This is implied by the `range(t)` construct.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute at all.
3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`idx`, `n`, `a`, `data`, `results`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition. They remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the key adjustments needed are ensuring that `t` is greater than 0, and initializing the loop variable `_` to 0.
