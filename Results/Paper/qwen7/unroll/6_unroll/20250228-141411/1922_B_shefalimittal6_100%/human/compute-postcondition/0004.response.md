Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is an integer from `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `data` remain unchanged from their initial states.
