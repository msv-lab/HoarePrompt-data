Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input as specified in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases (`t`), followed by the number of sticks (`n`) and their corresponding lengths (`a_i`).
2. The program then processes each test case to count the occurrences of each stick length using the array `v`.
3. For each test case, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. This is done by checking combinations of stick lengths where the sum of the two smaller lengths is greater than the largest length.
4. The logic for counting valid triangles is correct. Specifically:
   - If there are at least 2 sticks of the same length `i`, the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of length `i` and one other stick is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.
   - If there are at least 3 sticks of the same length `i`, the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of length `i` is `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.
   - The variable `cnt` keeps track of the cumulative count of sticks up to the current length `i`, which is used to avoid double-counting when calculating the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length.
5. The final results are stored in the `results` list and printed in the correct format.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
