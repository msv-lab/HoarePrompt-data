Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50; `sorted_lst` is a list of the same integers as `lst`, but sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `lst` and assigns the sorted version to `sorted_lst`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged in terms of its content, but its elements are now sorted. The length and range of the integers within the list also remain the same as the initial state.
