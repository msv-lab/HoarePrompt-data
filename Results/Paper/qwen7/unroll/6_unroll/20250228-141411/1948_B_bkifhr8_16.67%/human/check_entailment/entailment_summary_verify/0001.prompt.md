You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers (`lst`) where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50. It checks whether the list is sorted in ascending order and returns `True` if it is, otherwise it returns `False`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Operation Simulation:**
   - The program checks if the current element is greater than the previous element and if it is greater than or equal to 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the element into its individual digits and inserts them back into the array.
   - This operation is intended to help sort the array, but the implementation has some issues.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - After potentially splitting elements, the program calls `func_1` to check if the array is sorted.
   - `func_1` simply compares the original list with its sorted version and returns `True` if they are equal, indicating the array is sorted.

### Issues in the Implementation

1. **Incorrect Operation Logic:**
   - The logic for splitting the element and inserting digits is flawed. The program should not modify the array in place during the iteration. Instead, it should simulate the operation and check if sorting is possible without actually modifying the array.
   - The current implementation directly modifies `list1`, which can lead to incorrect results if the array changes during the iteration.

2. **Missing Key Considerations:**
   - The program does not handle cases where splitting an element might create a larger number that could disrupt the sorting order.
   - The program does not consider edge cases like leading zeros or negative numbers (though the problem constraints restrict these).

3. **Incomplete Solution:**
   - The program only checks if the array can be sorted after one pass of the operation. However, the problem allows for multiple operations, so the solution needs to account for this.

### Corrected Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the operation and check if sorting is possible. Here’s a revised approach:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Simulate the operation and check if sorting is possible
    while True:
        sorted_list = sorted(list1)
        if list1 == sorted_list:
            print('Yes')
            break
        changed = False
        for i in range(1, len(list1)):
            if list1[i - 1] > list1[i] and list1[i - 1] >= 10:
                a = list1[i - 1]
                list1[i - 1] = a // 10
                list1.insert(i, a % 10)
                changed = True
        if not changed:
            print('No')
            break
```

Given the issues in the original implementation, the provided program is **incorrect**. The correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
