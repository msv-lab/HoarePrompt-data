### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself, converting the input into a list of integers.

2. **Sorting Check Function:**
   - The function `func_1(lst)` checks if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version. This is a correct approach to check if the list is sorted.

3. **Operation Logic:**
   - The main loop iterates through the list starting from the second element (`p`).
   - If an element is greater than the previous one and greater than 10, it splits the element into its digits and inserts them back into the list.
   - However, there are issues with how the operation is implemented:
     - The operation should only be performed if the current element is greater than the previous one and is at least 10.
     - The operation is incorrectly implemented as it always pops and inserts the digits regardless of whether the condition is met.
     - The logic does not account for the possibility of making the array sorted after performing the operations multiple times.

4. **Correctness of the Main Logic:**
   - The main logic does not correctly simulate the process of repeatedly applying the operation until the array is sorted or it is determined that sorting is impossible.
   - The program assumes that performing the operation once will lead to a sorted array, which is not necessarily true. The operation needs to be applied multiple times until no more changes can be made.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
