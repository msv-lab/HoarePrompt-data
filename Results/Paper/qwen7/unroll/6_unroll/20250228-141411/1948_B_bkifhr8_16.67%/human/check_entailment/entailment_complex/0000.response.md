Reasoning:
1. The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the list and checking if any element greater than 10 exists. If such an element is found, it splits the element into its constituent digits and reinserts them into the list.
2. After attempting to split elements, the program calls `func_1` to check if the resulting list is sorted.
3. However, the logic to split elements is flawed. The program incorrectly splits the element and reinserts the digits without ensuring that the new elements maintain the original order relative to adjacent elements.
4. The `func_1` function correctly checks if the list is sorted but does not address the core issue of the splitting logic.
5. Given the flawed splitting logic, the program may not correctly determine if the array can be sorted through the allowed operations.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the logic for splitting elements and reinserting them does not ensure that the resulting array maintains the necessary order to eventually become sorted. The splitting process should be more carefully managed to preserve the relative order of elements.
