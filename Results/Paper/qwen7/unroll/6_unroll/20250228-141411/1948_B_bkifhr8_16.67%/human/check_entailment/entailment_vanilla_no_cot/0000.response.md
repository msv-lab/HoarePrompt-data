Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Digits**: The logic for splitting the digits of an element when it is greater than 10 is not implemented correctly. The program does not actually perform the digit splitting operation as described in the problem statement. Instead, it simply checks if an element is greater than 10 and then splits it into its digits without ensuring that the resulting array can be sorted.

2. **Function `func_1` is Redundant**: The function `func_1` is defined but never used in the main logic. The program directly checks if the modified list is sorted without calling this function. This makes the function redundant and unnecessary.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Operations**: The program attempts to split and insert digits but does not ensure that the operations are performed in a way that guarantees the array can be sorted. It merely checks if the final array is sorted after performing some operations, which is not sufficient.

4. **Missing Implementation of Digit Splitting**: The digit splitting operation is not implemented in the program. The program should iterate through the array and split elements that are greater than 10, inserting the digits back into the array.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to implement the digit splitting operation and ensure that the array can be sorted through these operations. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Function to split a number into its digits
    def split_number(num):
        digits = []
        while num > 0:
            digits.append(num % 10)
            num //= 10
        return digits[::-1]
    
    # Perform the digit splitting operation
    for p in range(len(list1) - 1, -1, -1):
        if list1[p] >= 10:
            digits = split_number(list1[p])
            list1.pop(p)
            list1[p:p] = digits
    
    # Check if the array is sorted
    if list1 == sorted(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This corrected version ensures that the digit splitting operation is performed correctly and checks if the resulting array can be sorted.
