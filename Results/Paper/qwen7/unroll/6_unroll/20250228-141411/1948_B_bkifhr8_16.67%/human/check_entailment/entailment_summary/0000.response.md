Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and performing the specified operation whenever an element greater than 10 is found. However, the program does not actually perform the digit splitting operation correctly. Instead, it simply checks if the array is sorted after a single pass through the loop, which is insufficient to ensure the array can be made sorted through the allowed operations.

Here's why the program is incorrect:
1. The program only performs one iteration over the array and checks if the array is sorted after that. This is not enough because the operation can be applied multiple times.
2. The program does not handle the case where the array cannot be sorted even after applying the operation multiple times.
3. The digit splitting operation is not implemented correctly. The program does not actually split the digits of the number and insert them back into the array as required.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations.

Correctness: **False**
