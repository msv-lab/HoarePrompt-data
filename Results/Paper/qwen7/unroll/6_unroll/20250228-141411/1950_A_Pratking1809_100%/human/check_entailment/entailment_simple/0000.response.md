Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `q` from the input.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.
3. The program checks if the digits form a stair (`a < b < c`) and prints "STAIR" if true.
4. It checks if the digits form a peak (`a < b > c`) and prints "PEAK" if true.
5. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".
6. The logic for checking the conditions is correct according to the problem statement.
7. The program handles multiple test cases as specified and outputs the correct results for each test case.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
