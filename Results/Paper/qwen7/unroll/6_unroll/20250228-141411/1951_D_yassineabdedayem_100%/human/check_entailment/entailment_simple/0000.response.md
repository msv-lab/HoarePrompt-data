Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `k`. This part is correct.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: When `n == k`, the solution prints "YES", 1, and 1. This is correct because if Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin each.
   - **Case 2**: When `n + 2 > k * 2`, the solution prints "YES", 2, followed by `n - k + 1` and 1. This is intended to handle cases where Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels using two stalls. However, this logic is flawed. Specifically:
     - If Alice has 7 coins (`n`) and needs to buy 3 jewels (`k`), the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` would be true (7 + 2 > 3 * 2). But the solution would incorrectly suggest setting up 2 stalls with prices 2 and 1, which would result in Alice buying 3 jewels (1 from the first stall and 2 from the second).
     - The correct approach should ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels across the stalls. The current logic does not guarantee this.
   - **Case 3**: When neither of the above conditions is met, the solution prints "NO". This is correct because if neither condition is satisfied, it is indeed impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Output Format**: The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where two stalls are used to achieve the desired number of jewels. A correct solution would need to ensure that the prices and number of stalls are set appropriately to guarantee Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Correctness: **False**
