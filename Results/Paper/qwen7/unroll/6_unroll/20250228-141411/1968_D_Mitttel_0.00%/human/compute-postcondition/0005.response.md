The only variables in the loop head are `steps` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `steps < k`. Right before the loop, `steps` is 0 and `k` is an integer.

For the loop to execute the first time, `steps` must be less than `k`. Since `steps` is currently 0, `k` must be greater than 0 to satisfy the condition `steps < k`.

State: **`steps` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
