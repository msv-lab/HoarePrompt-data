Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four lines with two integers per line representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It returns information about the squares based on the given coordinates.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases where each case provides coordinates of a square's corners. The function does not take any parameters but processes the input data to determine properties or characteristics of the squares defined by the coordinates.
