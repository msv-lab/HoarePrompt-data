The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` can be split into two halves such that one half is a rearrangement of the other. If such a rearrangement is possible, it prints the rearranged string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
