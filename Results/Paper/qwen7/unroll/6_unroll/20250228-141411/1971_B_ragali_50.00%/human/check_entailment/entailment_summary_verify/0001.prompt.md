You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` can be split into two halves such that one half is a rearrangement of the other. If such a rearrangement is possible, it prints the rearranged string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Checking for Unique Characters:**
   - A set `a` is used to store unique characters from the string `s`.
   - If the size of the set `a` is greater than 1, it means there are multiple unique characters in the string `s`.

3. **Generating New String `r`:**
   - If there are multiple unique characters, the program attempts to generate a new string `r` by rearranging the characters of `s`.
   - It tries to create a new string by splitting `s` into two halves and concatenating them in reverse order (`s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]`).
   - If this doesn't work, it tries reversing the entire string (`s[::-1]`).
   - If neither of these methods works, it prints `s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2]`.

4. **Handling Single Character Strings:**
   - If the set `a` has only one character, it directly prints 'NO' because no rearrangement can produce a different string.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Rearrangement Logic:**
   - The logic for generating `r` is flawed. For example, if `s` is 'codeforces', the program generates `forcodesec`, but this is not necessarily a valid rearrangement that is different from `s`. The logic should ensure that `r` is a valid rearrangement and not equal to `s`.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the string length is odd. For example, if `s` is 'co', the program should still be able to generate a valid rearrangement like 'oc'.

3. **Reversal Check:**
   - The check `if newstr != s:` is unnecessary because `newstr` is always a rearrangement of `s` and will never be equal to `s` if `s` has more than one unique character.

4. **General Validity:**
   - The program does not guarantee that the generated `r` is a valid rearrangement that is different from `s`. For example, if `s` is 'aaa', the program will generate 'aaa' again, which is not a valid rearrangement.

### Corrected Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the generated string `r` is a valid rearrangement and is different from `s`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        if len(set(s)) > 1:
            # Generate a valid rearrangement
            newstr = ''.join(sorted(s))
            if newstr != s:
                print('YES')
                print(newstr)
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the generated string `r` is a valid rearrangement and is different from `s`. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
