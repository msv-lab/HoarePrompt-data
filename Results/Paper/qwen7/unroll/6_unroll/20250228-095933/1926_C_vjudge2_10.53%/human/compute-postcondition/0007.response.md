Output State: **`total` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing t integers, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` + 1, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of the same length as `values`, with all elements initialized to 0.**

The code initializes the variable `total` to 0. This does not affect the lists `numbers`, `values`, and `sum_values`. Therefore, these lists retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
