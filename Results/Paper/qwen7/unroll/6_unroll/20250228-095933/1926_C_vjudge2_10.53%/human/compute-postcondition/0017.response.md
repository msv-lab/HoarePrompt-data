Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers: t and n. For each test case, t is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and n is an integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5. The function does not return a value directly but processes these test cases based on the given constraints.**
