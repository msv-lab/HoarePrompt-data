Output State: `total` is 45, `numbers` is unchanged, `values` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, 46], `sum_values` is [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 46, 48, 51, 55, 60, 66, 73, 80, 88, 97].

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the `numbers` list and prints the corresponding value from the `sum_values` list. Since `numbers` remains unchanged and the loop does not modify any of the other variables (`total`, `values`, or `sum_values`), their states remain the same after the loop execution.
