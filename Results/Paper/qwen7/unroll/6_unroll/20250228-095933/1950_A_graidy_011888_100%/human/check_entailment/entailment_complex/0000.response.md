Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.
3. The conditions for determining whether the sequence forms a 'STAIR' or a 'PEAK' are correctly implemented:
   - For 'STAIR': `a < b < c`
   - For 'PEAK': `a < b and b > c`
4. If neither condition is met, it correctly outputs 'NONE'.
5. The function matches the problem description and the provided examples perfectly.

Given the above points, the function appears to be correct and handles all specified cases accurately.

Correctness: **True**
