Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates through each test case.
- For each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
- The program checks the conditions for a 'STAIR' and a 'PEAK' correctly:
  - For a 'STAIR', it checks if \(a < b < c\).
  - For a 'PEAK', it checks if \(a < b\) and \(b > c\).
- If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.
- The logic and conditions in the program match the problem description exactly.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
