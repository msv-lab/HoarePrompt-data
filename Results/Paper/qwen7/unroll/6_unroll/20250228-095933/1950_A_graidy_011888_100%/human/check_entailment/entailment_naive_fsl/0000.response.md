Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal. According to the problem description, if `a = b = c`, the output should be "NONE". However, the current implementation does not check for this condition. For example, if the input is `0 0 0`, the program will output "STAIR" instead of "NONE".
