Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE', depending on the input values for each iteration of the loop. The number of lines will be equal to the value of `n`. Each line's output is determined by the condition checks within the loop based on the integers `a`, `b`, and `c` provided as input for each iteration. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, but `t` does not affect the loop's execution.
