### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to find the maximum number \( k \) such that we can partition the array into \( k \) segments where the cumulative XOR of each segment is less than or equal to \( x \).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is incorrectly named and does not match the problem requirements. It simply returns the length of the array modulo 31, which is irrelevant to the problem.
   - The function should be named `find_max` and should implement the logic to find the maximum \( k \) as described in the problem.

3. **Function `find_max`**:
   - The function correctly implements the logic to find the maximum \( k \) by recursively processing the array and checking the cumulative XOR values.
   - It uses bit manipulation to check the \( bit \)-th bit of the cumulative XOR values and decides whether to include the current segment or start a new one.
   - The base case is when `bit` is -1, in which case it returns the length of the current segment.
   - For each bit position, it creates a new list `new_arr` containing cumulative XOR values where the \( bit \)-th bit is 0.
   - It then checks the \( bit \)-th bit of \( x \) and decides whether to return the maximum value between the result of another call to `find_max` with `bit-1` and the length of `new_arr`, or to return -1 or the maximum value in `new_arr` where the \( bit \)-th bit is 0.

4. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The main loop reads the test cases and calls `func_1` with the array and \( x \).
   - However, `func_1` is not implemented correctly and should be replaced with `find_max`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because `func_1` does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. Instead, it returns an irrelevant value. The `find_max` function, although correctly implemented, is called incorrectly.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Suggested Fix:
Replace `func_1` with the correct implementation of `find_max` as described in the problem statement.
