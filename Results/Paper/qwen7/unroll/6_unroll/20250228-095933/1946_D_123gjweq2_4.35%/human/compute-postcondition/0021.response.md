The function `find_max` accepts two parameters: `cur_arr`, which is a list of integers, and `bit`, which is an integer representing the current bit position being considered. Based on the conditions provided:

- Case_1: The function returns the length of the list `cur_arr`.
- Case_2: The function returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.
- Case_3: The function returns either -1 or the maximum value in `new_arr` where the `bit`-th bit of the value is 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `find_max` is to accept a list of integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit`, and based on specific conditions, return either the length of `cur_arr`, the maximum value between a recursive call and the length of `new_arr`, or -1 or the maximum value in `new_arr` where the `bit`-th bit is 0.
