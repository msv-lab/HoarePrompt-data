Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the result of find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1) and the length of new_arr.**

Explanation: The code returns the maximum value between two quantities. The first quantity is the result of calling `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)`, which finds the maximum value in `cur_arr` where the `bit-1`-th bit is 1. The second quantity is the length of `new_arr`, which is the number of elements in `new_arr`. Both of these values are determined based on the initial state provided.
