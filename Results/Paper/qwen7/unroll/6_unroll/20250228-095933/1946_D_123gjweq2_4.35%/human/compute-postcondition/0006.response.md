Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in cur_arr:`. The objects involved here are `i`, `cur_arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` will take each value from `cur_arr` in sequence during each iteration.
   - `cur_arr` is a list of integers representing a segment of the array `a`.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `cur_arr` must contain at least one element. If `cur_arr` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` will take values from `cur_arr`, we don't need to explicitly set its initial value (it will be set during each iteration).
   - We need to ensure that `cur_arr` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `cur_arr` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`cur_arr` must contain at least one element**.
