Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program attempts to calculate the difference between the number of tokens and the number of unique tokens in each line, which is not relevant to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not account for the distribution of cards between two players and the optimal strategy for scoring points.

To solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the game and consider the optimal moves for both players. The current implementation does not handle the game mechanics or the strategic decisions required to maximize the score for the player. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
