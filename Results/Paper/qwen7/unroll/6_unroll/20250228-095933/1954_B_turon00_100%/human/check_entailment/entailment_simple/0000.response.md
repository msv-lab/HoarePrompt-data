Reasoning:
The given solution attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and counting consecutive elements that are the same. It then determines the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the "beautiful" property of the array. However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Minimum Removals**: The code only counts consecutive elements and does not correctly handle the condition where the array can be split into segments where each segment has the same value, but the segments themselves are different. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the solution would incorrectly count the minimum removals as 1 (removing one '1' or '2'), but the correct answer should be 1 (removing the entire segment `[1, 2, 1]`).

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not properly handle edge cases where the array can be reduced to a non-beautiful state by removing fewer elements than initially thought. For instance, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the solution would incorrectly count the minimum removals as 3, but the correct answer should be 3 (removing the segment `[3, 5, 3]`).

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
