Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It determines the minimum length of contiguous segments within the list \( a \) where all elements are identical. If no such segment exists, it outputs -1 for each test case. The function ultimately prints \( t \) integers, one for each test case, indicating the minimum segment length or -1 if no valid segment is found.**
