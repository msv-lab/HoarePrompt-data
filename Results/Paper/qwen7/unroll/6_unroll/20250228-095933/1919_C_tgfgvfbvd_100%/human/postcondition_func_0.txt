The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. It calculates and prints the number of times the values of \( a \) or \( b \) are updated within each test case. The initial values of \( a \) and \( b \) are set to infinity, and during the iteration over the list, \( a \) and \( b \) are updated based on the conditions provided. The function outputs the count of updates for each test case.
