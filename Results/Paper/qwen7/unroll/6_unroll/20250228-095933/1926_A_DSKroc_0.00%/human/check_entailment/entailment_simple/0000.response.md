### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Counting**: For each test case, the program counts the number of 'A's and 'B's in the input string.
3. **Comparison and Output**: After counting, it compares the counts of 'A' and 'B'. If 'A' is more frequent, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'.
4. **Edge Cases**: The logic handles all possible combinations of 'A' and 'B' in the input strings, including edge cases where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal (though this is not explicitly handled in the code, it would still follow the same logic).
5. **Loop and Conditional Logic**: The loop iterates over each test case, and the conditional statement correctly determines the most frequent character.

Given the provided example and the problem description, the program logic is sound and should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

### Correctness:
**True**
