You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `ac` is the total number of 'A's across all strings `s` entered, `bc` is the total number of characters that are not 'A' across all strings `s` entered.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: 'B'
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `ac` is the total number of 'A's across all strings `s` entered, `bc` is the total number of characters that are not 'A' across all strings `s` entered. If the number of 'A's (`ac`) is greater than the number of non-'A' characters (`bc`), then the condition remains as is. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 32 input strings, each of length 5 containing only 'A' and 'B'. It counts the total number of 'A's and 'B's across all strings. Based on whether the count of 'A's is greater than the count of 'B's, it prints 'A' or 'B'. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Counting**: For each test case, the program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' using two counters `ac` and `bc`.
3. **Comparison and Output**: After counting the occurrences, the program compares the counts of 'A' and 'B'. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all provided test cases correctly. It processes each character in the string and updates the counters appropriately.
5. **Distinct Strings**: The problem statement mentions that all strings in a test are distinct, but this does not affect the correctness of the program since it processes each string independently.

Given the above points, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

### Correctness:
**True**
