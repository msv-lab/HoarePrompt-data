### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Counting**: For each test case, the program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' using two counters `ac` and `bc`.
3. **Comparison and Output**: After counting the occurrences, the program compares the counts of 'A' and 'B'. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all provided test cases correctly. It processes each character in the string and updates the counters appropriately.
5. **Distinct Strings**: The problem statement mentions that all strings in a test are distinct, but this does not affect the correctness of the program since it processes each string independently.

Given the above points, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

### Correctness:
**True**
