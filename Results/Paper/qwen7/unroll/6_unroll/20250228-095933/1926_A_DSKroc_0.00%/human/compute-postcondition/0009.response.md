Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `ac` is the total number of 'A's across all strings `s` entered, `bc` is the total number of characters that are not 'A' across all strings `s` entered. If the number of 'A's (`ac`) is greater than the number of non-'A' characters (`bc`), then the condition remains as is. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.
