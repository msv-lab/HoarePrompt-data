#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order, which is the same as comparing `lst` with its sorted version `sorted_lst`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst`, where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50. It checks whether the list is sorted in non-decreasing order and returns `True` if it is, otherwise it returns `False`.
