### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the key points and verify them:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Digits:**
   - The program attempts to split digits from elements that are at least 10 and reinsert them. However, it does not handle elements that are less than 10 properly. This can lead to incorrect results, as the operation should only be applied to elements that are at least 10.
   - For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program splits `12` into `[1, 2]` and inserts them, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`. However, the correct approach would be to split `45` and `67` and reinsert their digits, leading to `[12, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` simply checks if the array is sorted. While this is a necessary part of the solution, it is called after the array has been modified, which may not reflect the intended state of the array after applying the operations. The function should ideally be used to check the sorted state before performing any operations.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array is already sorted or where the operations cannot make the array sorted. For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program should eventually sort it to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, but the current implementation might not achieve this.

Given these issues, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the required functionality to transform the array into a sorted state using the specified operations.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect based on the analysis.
