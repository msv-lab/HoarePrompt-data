Reasoning:
1. The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and checking if the current element is greater than the previous one and greater than 10. If so, it splits the element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
2. However, the core logic of splitting elements and inserting digits is not correctly implemented. The program simply pops and inserts the digits without ensuring the resulting array is sorted.
3. The function `func_1` checks if the modified list is sorted, but this check is performed after the incorrect digit splitting logic.
4. The program does not actually perform the digit splitting and insertion correctly. It only checks if the array is sorted after an incorrect transformation.
5. Given the problem constraints and the need to correctly split and reorder elements, the current implementation is flawed and will not produce the correct results.

Correctness: **False**
