### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to understand its behavior and compare it with the requirements.

#### Key Points:
1. **Problem Description**: We need to determine if we can transform the array into a sorted array using the specified operations.
2. **Operations**: We can take any element of the array that is at least 10, delete it, and insert its digits in the same position.
3. **Current Implementation**:
   - The program iterates through the array and checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and greater than 10.
   - If so, it splits the element into its digits and reinserts them.
   - After processing, it calls `func_1` to check if the array is sorted.

#### Analysis:
1. **Initial Assumption**: The program assumes that if it can split and reinsert elements to make the array look sorted, then it can indeed be sorted.
2. **Function `func_1`**: This function simply checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. It doesn't consider the operations performed during the loop.
3. **Splitting and Reinsertion**: The program attempts to split elements greater than 10 and reinsert their digits. However, it does not ensure that the array can be transformed into a sorted array through these operations.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
3
4
34 2 1 4
```

- Initial array: `[34, 2, 1, 4]`
- After processing:
  - `34` is split into `[3, 4]` and reinserted, resulting in `[3, 4, 2, 1, 4]`.
  - The array is still not sorted.

The program incorrectly assumes that the array can be sorted just because it can be rearranged into a form that appears sorted. However, it does not guarantee that the array can be transformed into a sorted array through the specified operations.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. The current implementation does not account for all possible permutations of splits and does not guarantee that the array can be sorted.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
