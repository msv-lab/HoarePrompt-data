Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Specifically, the program attempts to split elements greater than 10 into their individual digits and reinsert them, but it does not properly handle the sorting condition. Hereâ€™s a counterexample to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the input:
```
3
4
34 2 1 4
```

The program should check if it's possible to sort the array `[34, 2, 1, 4]` using the specified operations. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the splitting and reinsertion process to ensure the array can be sorted. Instead, it simply checks if the modified array is sorted after performing the operations, which is not sufficient.

To fix this, the program needs to simulate the splitting and reinsertion process and verify if the resulting array can be sorted. The current approach does not account for all possible permutations of splits and does not guarantee that the array can be sorted. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
