Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `num` which is being assigned values from `numbers[1:]`.

2. **Understand the initial state**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - `k_i` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\).
   - `hcf` is assigned the value of `numbers[0]`.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop will start with `num` being assigned the first element of `numbers[1:]`, which means `num` will be the second element of the original `numbers` list.
   - For the loop to execute, `numbers` must have at least two elements.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the length of the `numbers` list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k_i`, and `hcf`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `numbers` must have at least 2 elements.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`numbers` must have at least 2 elements**
