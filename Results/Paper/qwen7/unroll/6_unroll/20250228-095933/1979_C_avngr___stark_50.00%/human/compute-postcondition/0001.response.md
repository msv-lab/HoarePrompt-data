Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in numbers[1:]`. The objects involved here are `num` and `numbers`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `num` will take the values from `numbers[1:]`, meaning it will start with the second element of the `numbers` list.
   - `numbers` remains the same list as before the loop.

3. **Check the constraints and requirements**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - `k_i` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\).
   - `hcf` is assigned the value of `numbers[0]`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `num` being the second element of `numbers`, `numbers` must contain at least two elements.
   - `num` will be initialized to `numbers[1]` at the start of the loop.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `numbers` must have at least two elements.
- `num` must be initialized to `numbers[1]`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: `numbers` is a list with at least two elements, `num` is `numbers[1]`**
