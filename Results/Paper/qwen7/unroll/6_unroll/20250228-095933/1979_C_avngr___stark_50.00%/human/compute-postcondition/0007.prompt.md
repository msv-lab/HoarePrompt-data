You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; k_i is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `k_i` is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `hcf` is the highest common factor (greatest common divisor) of all elements in `numbers`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates through each element in `numbers` starting from the second element. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) between the current value of `hcf` and the current element of `numbers`, updating `hcf` with this new GCD value. After completing all iterations, `hcf` will hold the GCD of all elements in the `numbers` list.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the highest common factor (HCF) or greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list `numbers` after iterating through each element and updating the HCF accordingly.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of positive integers `numbers` and returns the highest common factor (HCF) or greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the highest common factor (HCF) or greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list `numbers` after iterating through each element and updating the HCF accordingly.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
