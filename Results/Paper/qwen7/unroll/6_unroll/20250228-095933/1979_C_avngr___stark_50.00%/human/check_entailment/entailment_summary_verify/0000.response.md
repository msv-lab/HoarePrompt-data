### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`n`) and the multipliers (`k_i`).

2. **Calculating the Total Bet:**
   - The variable `m` is calculated as the product of all multipliers (`k_i`).
   - This value `m` represents the least amount of coins you need to win for any outcome.

3. **Distributing the Bets:**
   - The program calculates the initial list of bets by dividing `m` by each `k_i`.
   - It then finds the GCD of these bets using `func_1`.
   - Each bet is divided by this GCD to normalize the bets.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than `m / hcf`.
   - If the sum is less than `m / hcf`, it prints the normalized bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly computes the GCD of a list of numbers using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.
   - It initializes the GCD with the first element and iteratively updates it by taking the GCD with each subsequent element.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The logic in the program seems to follow the problem statement correctly. It ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome.
- The GCD calculation in `func_1` is correct and used appropriately.
- The normalization step (dividing each bet by the GCD) ensures that the bets are simplified while maintaining their relative proportions.
- The check at the end (`if sum(c) >= m / hcf`) ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and meets the requirements of the problem. The original assessment incorrectly identified a logical error where the program fails to meet the requirement. However, upon closer inspection, the program actually does meet the requirement correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the function summaries.
