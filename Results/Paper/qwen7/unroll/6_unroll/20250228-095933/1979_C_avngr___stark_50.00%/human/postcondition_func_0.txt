The function accepts a list of positive integers `numbers` and returns the highest common factor (HCF) or greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list. It does this by initializing the HCF with the first element of the list and then iteratively updating the HCF by calculating the GCD between the current HCF and each subsequent element in the list.
