### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - This means for each outcome \(i\), the total bet amount \(S\) should satisfy \(S < k_i \cdot \text{bet}_i\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`n`) and the multipliers (`k`).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers (`m`), which represents the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers when divided by each individual multiplier.
   - It then computes the required bet amounts (`c`) for each outcome by dividing `m` by each `k[i]`.
   - The `func_1` function is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the computed bet amounts.
   - After finding the GCD, the bet amounts are divided by this GCD to ensure they are simplified.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the simplified bet amounts is less than the LCM divided by the GCD. If true, it prints the simplified bet amounts; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for calculating the bet amounts and checking the condition is sound.
   - The use of GCD ensures that the bet amounts are simplified, which is necessary to minimize the total bet while satisfying the condition.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the approach to calculate the bet amounts. The product `m` calculated as the product of all multipliers is not necessarily the LCM of the multipliers. The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the multipliers, but the product of all multipliers might be much larger and not necessarily the LCM.
   - The calculation of bet amounts as `int(m / k[i])` might not yield the correct values because it does not consider the actual LCM. For example, if the multipliers are 2, 3, and 4, the LCM is 12, but the product is 24. Dividing 24 by 2, 3, and 4 gives 12, 8, and 6 respectively, which do not satisfy the condition when summed up.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the code incorrectly calculates the bet amounts using the product of all multipliers instead of their LCM. This leads to incorrect bet amounts that do not guarantee the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
