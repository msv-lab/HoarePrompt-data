### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a number of outcomes and their respective multipliers.
   - For each test case, we need to find a distribution of coins such that the total bet is less than the payout for any winning outcome.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`n`) and the multipliers (`k`).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers (`m`), which should represent the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers when divided by each individual multiplier. However, the calculation of `m` as the product of all multipliers is incorrect because the LCM should be calculated using the `gcd` function.
   - It then computes the required bet amounts (`c`) for each outcome by dividing `m` by each `k[i]`. This step assumes that `m` is the LCM, but since `m` is actually the product of all multipliers, this step is flawed.
   - The `func_1` function correctly finds the GCD of the computed bet amounts.
   - After finding the GCD, the bet amounts are divided by this GCD to ensure they are simplified.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the simplified bet amounts is less than the LCM divided by the GCD. If true, it prints the simplified bet amounts; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for calculating the bet amounts and checking the condition is fundamentally flawed because the product of all multipliers is not the LCM.
   - The code incorrectly calculates `m` as the product of all multipliers instead of the LCM.
   - Even if the GCD is correctly calculated, the bet amounts are still based on an incorrect assumption about `m`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the core logic of the program is flawed. The product of all multipliers is not the LCM, and thus the bet amounts calculated are incorrect. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
