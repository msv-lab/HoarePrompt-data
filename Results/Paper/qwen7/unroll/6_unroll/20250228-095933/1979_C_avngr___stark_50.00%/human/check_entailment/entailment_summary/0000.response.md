Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins across different outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This means for each outcome \(i\), the sum of all bets should be less than \(k_i \times \text{bet}_i\).

2. **Key Logic in the Code**:
   - The code calculates the product of all multipliers \(k_i\) and stores it in variable `m`.
   - It then computes the bet amounts for each outcome by dividing `m` by each \(k_i\) and storing the results in list `c`.
   - The function `func_1` (which is `gcd` from the `math` module) is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in list `c`. This step is crucial because it normalizes the bet amounts.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of normalized bet amounts is less than or equal to the normalized product `m / hcf`. If true, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists; otherwise, it prints the normalized bet amounts.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies when a valid distribution is impossible (`sum(c) >= m / hcf`).
   - The GCD calculation ensures that the bet amounts are simplified, which is necessary for the final check.
   - The example outputs match the problem statement, confirming the approach works for the given examples.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
