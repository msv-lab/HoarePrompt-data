You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                (r, l) = [i, j]
                over_sum = sm
    return (r, l)

#Function 2:
def func_2(r, l, ops: list):
    if r == l:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)

#Function 3:
def func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` takes four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It updates the list `lst` by replacing the sublist from index `r + 1` to `l + 1` (inclusive) with `n` copies of `n`, where `n` is the length of the specified sublist. Additionally, it appends certain operations to the `ops` list, including the indices `r + 1` and `l + 1`, and possibly the value `0` based on the presence of zero in the sublist. The function ultimately returns the modified list `lst`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not follow the problem description and do not achieve the goal of maximizing the sum of the array elements through the specified operations.

1. **Incorrect Approach**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not seem to directly address the problem of finding the optimal subarray to apply the MEX operation to. Instead, they appear to be attempting to find a way to maximize the sum by some other means, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

2. **Example Case**: Consider the input `[1, 100, 2, 1]`. The correct approach would be to apply the MEX operation to the subarray `[1, 100, 2]` to change it to `[3, 3, 3]`, resulting in a new array `[3, 3, 3, 1]` with a sum of 10 + 1 = 105. However, the provided functions do not perform this operation correctly. For instance, `func_1` attempts to find a subarray that maximizes a certain sum, but it does not consider the MEX operation or how to apply it to achieve the maximum sum.

3. **Lack of MEX Operation**: The functions do not include any logic to compute the MEX of a subarray and apply the operation to make all elements in the subarray equal to the MEX value. This is a critical part of the problem's solution.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and thus is incorrect.
