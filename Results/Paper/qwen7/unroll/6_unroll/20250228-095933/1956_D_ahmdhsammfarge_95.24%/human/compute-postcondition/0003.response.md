Postcondition: **`r` is an integer such that `0 <= r < len(lst)`, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `ops` is a list that includes `[r + 1, l + 1, [r + 1, l + 1]]`. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[l:r + 1]` is 0, then `ops` is updated to include `[r + 1, l + 1, [r + 1, l + 1], 0]`. Otherwise, `ops` remains as `[r + 1, l + 1, [r + 1, l + 1]]`.**
