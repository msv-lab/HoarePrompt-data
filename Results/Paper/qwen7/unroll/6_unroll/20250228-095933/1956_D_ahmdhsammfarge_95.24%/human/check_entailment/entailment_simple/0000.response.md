### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to find the indices `r` and `l` such that the sum of the elements before `i` and after `j` plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2` is maximized.
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it uses a nested loop to check every possible subarray and updates `over_sum` and `r`, `l` accordingly. However, this approach is inefficient and may not correctly identify the optimal subarray for maximizing the sum.

2. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is intended to replace the subarray from index `r` to `l` with the value `n - (l - r + 1)`, where `n` is the length of the subarray.
   - The function also appends operations to the `ops` list. However, the logic inside `func_3` is incomplete and does not correctly handle the case when the minimum value in the subarray is 0.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is called recursively to append operations to the `ops` list. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided code, which means there is a missing function definition.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program logic is incomplete and does not correctly implement the required operations to maximize the sum of the array.
   - The program attempts to use `func_1` to find indices `r` and `l`, but these functions are not correctly implemented to achieve the desired result.

Given the above issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are either incomplete or do not follow the correct logic to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
