Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of non-negative integers, and the length of lst is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).
def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                r, l = [i, j]
                over_sum = sm
        
    #State: Output State: `r` is an index from the list `lst`, `l` is an index from the list `lst`, both indices satisfy the condition that the sum of the elements before `i` and after `j` plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2` is greater than `over_sum`. All other variables remain unchanged.
    return r, l
    #The program returns two indices `r` and `l` from the list `lst`, where the sum of the elements before `r` and after `l` plus `(l - r + 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` of non-negative integers and returns two indices `r` and `l` from the list, where the sum of the elements before index `r` and after index `l` plus `(l - r + 1)` is maximized.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: r and l are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < n, and ops is a list used to store the operations.
def func_2(r, l, ops):
    if (r == l) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
        #The program returns a list containing [r + 1, l + 1]
    #State: r and l are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < n, and ops is a list used to store the operations. r is not equal to l
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `r`, `l`, and `ops`. `r` and `l` are integers where `0 <= l <= r < n`, and `ops` is a list used to store operations. If `r` equals `l`, the function appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` and returns. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself twice with `l - 1`, appending `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` each time. The function ultimately returns a list containing `[r + 1, l + 1]`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `r` and `l` are integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)` and `lst` is a list of non-negative integers. `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed.
def func_3(r, l, lst, ops):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if (min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    #State: `r` is an integer such that `0 <= r < len(lst)`, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `ops` is a list that includes `[r + 1, l + 1, [r + 1, l + 1]]`. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[l:r + 1]` is 0, then `ops` is updated to include `[r + 1, l + 1, [r + 1, l + 1], 0]`. Otherwise, `ops` remains as `[r + 1, l + 1, [r + 1, l + 1]]`.
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst
    #The program returns the list `lst` where the sublist from index `r + 1` to `l + 1` (inclusive) is replaced by `n` copies of `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It updates the list `lst` by replacing the sublist from index `r + 1` to `l + 1` (inclusive) with `n` copies of `n`, where `n` is the length of the specified sublist. Additionally, it appends certain operations to the `ops` list, including the indices `r + 1` and `l + 1`, and possibly the value `0` based on the presence of zero in the sublist. The function ultimately returns the modified list `lst`.
