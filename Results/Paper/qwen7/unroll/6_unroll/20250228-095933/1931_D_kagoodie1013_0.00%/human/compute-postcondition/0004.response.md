Output State: **The program returns a list 'results' where each element corresponds to the count calculated for each 'test_cases' entry. For each entry, the count is determined by iterating through the array 'arr', calculating the modulus of each number with respect to 'x' and 'y', and counting the occurrences of these moduli in 'mod_x_map' and 'mod_y_map'. The final count for each entry is the sum of the counts from both maps.**

This means that for each test case in `test_cases`, the program calculates the count by iterating over the array `arr`, finding the modulus of each number with `x` and `y`, and then summing up the occurrences of these moduli in the dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`. The result for each test case is then added to the list `results`.
