Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find beautiful pairs. Specifically, the program uses `mod_x = -num % x` which is incorrect for calculating the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`. This can lead to incorrect results, especially when `num` is negative. For example, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  6 5 2
  1 2 7 4 9 6
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Program Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

In this case, the program seems to work correctly. However, let's consider another test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  6 5 -2
  1 -2 7 -4 9 -6
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Program Output:
  ```
  0
  ```

Here, the program fails because it incorrectly handles negative values due to the use of `-num % x`. For instance, `-2 % 5` should be `3`, but the program calculates it as `3` instead of `-2`. This leads to incorrect counting of beautiful pairs.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly when dealing with negative numbers.
