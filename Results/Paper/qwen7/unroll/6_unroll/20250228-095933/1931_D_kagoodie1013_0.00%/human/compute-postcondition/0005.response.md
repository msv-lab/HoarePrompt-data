Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), followed by a list of \( n \) integers representing the array \( a \). For each entry in test_cases, the function calculates the count of occurrences of the moduli of each number in the array with respect to \( x \) and \( y \), and returns a list of these counts.**
