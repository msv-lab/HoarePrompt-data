### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Processing:**
   - The program correctly reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It extracts the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` for each test case.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - It initializes two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of numbers modulo `x` and `y` respectively.
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the modulus with respect to `x` and `y`, and updates the count of beautiful pairs using these dictionaries.
   - The logic for calculating the number of beautiful pairs seems correct:
     - For each element, it checks how many previous elements have the required modulus values to form a beautiful pair.
     - It updates the dictionaries with the current element's modulus values.

3. **Modulo Calculation:**
   - The calculation of `mod_x` as `-num % x` is a bit unconventional but works correctly. It ensures that the result is always non-negative.
   - The calculation of `mod_y` as `num % y` is straightforward and correct.

4. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - The function correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs by checking the modulus conditions for each element against the previously seen elements' moduli.
   - The logic for updating the dictionaries and counting the pairs is sound.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the results for each test case correctly, printing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs for each test case. The function `func_1` accurately calculates the number of beautiful pairs using the given conditions.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description.
