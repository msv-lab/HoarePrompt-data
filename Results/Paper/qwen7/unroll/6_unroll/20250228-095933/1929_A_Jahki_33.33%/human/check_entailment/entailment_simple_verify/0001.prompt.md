You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the elements of the array, and num2 is not used in the function and can be ignored.
def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array, and order is the number of adjacent pairs (i, i+1) where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements `case`.

2. **Parsing Input:**
   - It converts the string `case` into a list of integers `a` using a list comprehension.
   - It calls `func_1(a, num2)` to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Calculating Maximum Beauty:**
   - If `func_1(a, num2)` returns `True`, it means the array is already sorted, and the beauty is `0`.
   - If `func_1(a, num2)` returns `False`, it sorts the array `a` and calculates the beauty.
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

### Correctness Check:

1. **If the Array is Already Sorted:**
   - If the array is already sorted, the beauty is `0`. This is correct because the beauty is defined as the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from `2` to `n`. If the array is sorted, these differences will be zero.

2. **If the Array is Not Sorted:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` are maximized. The maximum beauty is achieved by arranging the elements such that the smallest element is paired with the next smallest, and so on.
   - The program correctly sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `[2, 1, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Beauty: `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Beauty: `0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
  - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - Beauty: `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 100`
  - Output: `57` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `[3, 4, 3, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
  - Beauty: `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `[2, 1]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
  - Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array after rearranging its elements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
