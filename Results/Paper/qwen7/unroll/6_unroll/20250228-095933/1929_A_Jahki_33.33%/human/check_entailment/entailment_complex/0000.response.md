Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. Rearranging the array elements allows us to achieve this.

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array and then calculate the sum of differences between consecutive elements. Sorting ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest possible elements, maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative ones.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: 
   - This function checks if the array is already in non-ascending order (each element is less than or equal to the previous one).
   - If the array is already in non-ascending order, the function returns `True`, indicating no rearrangement is needed.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating some rearrangement is needed.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly identifies whether the array needs to be rearranged by calling `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it means the array is already in the optimal order, so the beauty is `0`.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

5. **Verification**:
   - For the example test cases:
     - Test Case 1: `[2, 1, 3]` -> Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]` -> Beauty: `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`
     - Test Case 2: `[69, 69, 69]` -> Already in order -> Beauty: `0`
     - Test Case 3: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]` -> Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]` -> Beauty: `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 57`
     - Test Case 4: `[3, 4, 3, 3]` -> Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]` -> Beauty: `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 1`
     - Test Case 5: `[2, 1]` -> Sorted: `[1, 2]` -> Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`

The program logic matches the problem requirements and examples provided.
