Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The function `func_1` is not used correctly and does not serve the intended purpose. The function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, but this check is unnecessary for finding the maximum beauty.

2. **Sorting and Calculation**: The program sorts the array and calculates the beauty using the sorted array. This approach is correct for finding the maximum beauty, but the sorting step should only be done once after reading all the test cases, not inside the loop.

3. **Efficient Approach**: Instead of sorting the array in each iteration, you can sort the entire list of arrays at the beginning and then calculate the beauty for each array.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
num = int(input())
results = []

for i in range(num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    b = sorted(a)
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    results.append(beauty)

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This version reads all the test cases first, sorts the array for each test case, and then calculates the beauty. This ensures that the sorting is done only once per test case, improving efficiency.
