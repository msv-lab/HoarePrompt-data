State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array, and order is 0, `i` is 1, `num2` must be greater than 1** 

### Explanation:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `num2`.
2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `a` is a list of integers (this state is already given and doesn't need adjustment).
   - `order` is 0 (this state is already given and doesn't need adjustment).
3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(1, num2)` will execute as long as `num2 > 1` and `i` starts from 1 and goes up to but not including `num2`.
4. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` should start from 1.
   - `num2` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Thus, the required adjustments are to set `i` to 1 and ensure `num2` is greater than 1.
