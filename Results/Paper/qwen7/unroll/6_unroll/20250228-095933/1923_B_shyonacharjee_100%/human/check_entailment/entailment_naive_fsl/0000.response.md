Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple monsters are at the same distance from the player but have different health values. Specifically, the program sorts the monsters based on their absolute position and then calculates the total bullets needed to kill them. However, it does not ensure that the bullets are distributed optimally among the monsters at the same distance.

Consider the following test case:
```
3 2
1 2 1
-1 1 1
```

In this case:
- There are 3 monsters.
- You can fire 2 bullets per second.
- The monsters are at positions -1, 1, and 1 with health 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

The program will sort the monsters by their absolute positions and then calculate the total bullets needed. However, since the monsters at position 1 have different health values, the program will not distribute the bullets optimally. It will fire 2 bullets at the monster with health 2, which is not enough to kill it, and then it will check the next monster, which is already at the same position. This results in the program incorrectly determining that you can survive.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the bullets are distributed such that the monster with the highest health at the same distance is killed first. This can be achieved by sorting the monsters not only by their absolute positions but also by their health values in descending order within the same distance.
