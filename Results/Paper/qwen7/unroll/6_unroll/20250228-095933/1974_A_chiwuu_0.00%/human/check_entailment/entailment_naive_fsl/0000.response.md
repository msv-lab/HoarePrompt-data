Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. Let's consider the following example:

- For \(x = 12\) and \(y = 4\), the program should calculate the minimum number of screens required. According to the problem, each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell. The total number of cells required is \(12 + 4 \times 4 = 28\). Since each screen has \(5 \times 3 = 15\) cells, we need to calculate how many screens are required to fit these icons.

The program calculates the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the screens and then tries to fit the remaining 1x1 icons. However, the logic for fitting the remaining 1x1 icons is flawed. Here's a corrected approach:

1. Calculate the number of full 2x2 icons that can fit into the screens: \(\text{full\_2x2} = \left\lfloor \frac{b \times 4}{15} \right\rfloor\).
2. Calculate the remaining cells after placing the full 2x2 icons: \(\text{remaining\_cells} = 15 \times \text{full\_2x2} - b \times 4\).
3. Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons: \(\text{additional\_screens} = \left\lceil \frac{a - \text{remaining\_cells}}{15} \right\rceil\).

The total number of screens required is \(\text{full\_2x2} + \text{additional\_screens}\).

Let's rework the program with this logic:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        full_2x2 = b * 4 // 15
        remaining_cells = 15 * full_2x2 - b * 4
        additional_screens = (a - remaining_cells + 14) // 15
        print(full_2x2 + additional_screens)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program accurately calculates the minimum number of screens required for placing the icons.
