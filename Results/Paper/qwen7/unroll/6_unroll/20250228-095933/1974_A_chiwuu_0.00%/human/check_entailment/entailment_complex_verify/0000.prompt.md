You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a non-negative integer determined by the final value after executing the loop for each iteration based on the given conditions. The exact value of `t` depends on the inputs provided within each iteration of the loop, but it will always be a non-negative integer resulting from the specified operations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: t, x, and y. For each test case, it calculates a non-negative integer t based on specific conditions involving x and y. The final value of t is determined through a series of arithmetic operations and conditional checks. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the calculated t for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. Let's consider the following example:

- For \(x = 12\) and \(y = 4\), the program should calculate the minimum number of screens required. According to the problem, each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell. The total number of cells required is \(12 + 4 \times 4 = 28\). Since each screen has \(5 \times 3 = 15\) cells, we need to calculate how many screens are required to fit these icons.

The program calculates the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the screens and then tries to fit the remaining 1x1 icons. However, the logic for fitting the remaining 1x1 icons is flawed. Here's a corrected approach:

1. Calculate the number of full 2x2 icons that can fit into the screens: \(\text{full\_2x2} = \left\lfloor \frac{b \times 4}{15} \right\rfloor\).
2. Calculate the remaining cells after placing the full 2x2 icons: \(\text{remaining\_cells} = 15 \times \text{full\_2x2} - b \times 4\).
3. Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons: \(\text{additional\_screens} = \left\lceil \frac{a - \text{remaining\_cells}}{15} \right\rceil\).

The total number of screens required is \(\text{full\_2x2} + \text{additional\_screens}\).

Let's rework the program with this logic:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        full_2x2 = b * 4 // 15
        remaining_cells = 15 * full_2x2 - b * 4
        additional_screens = (a - remaining_cells + 14) // 15
        print(full_2x2 + additional_screens)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program accurately calculates the minimum number of screens required for placing the icons.
