Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons. Here's why:

1. **Calculation of Spaces for 2x2 Icons**: The code calculates `t` as `b * 2` and then checks if this value is divisible by 5. If not, it adds 1. This logic is flawed because it doesn't account for the fact that each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and these cells must be placed in a way that minimizes the number of screens.

2. **Remaining Space Calculation**: After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining space is calculated as `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`. However, this calculation does not correctly reflect the available space after placing the 2x2 icons. It should consider the actual number of 1x1 cells left after placing the 2x2 icons.

3. **Final Screen Calculation**: The final number of screens is calculated incorrectly. The logic for adding more screens based on the remaining 1x1 icons is not correctly implemented.

### Correct Solution:
Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        total_cells = 5 * 3
        screens_needed = 0
        
        # Place 2x2 icons
        while b > 0:
            if total_cells >= 4:
                total_cells -= 4
                b -= 1
            else:
                screens_needed += 1
                total_cells = 15
        
        # Place 1x1 icons
        while a > 0:
            if total_cells >= 1:
                total_cells -= 1
                a -= 1
            else:
                screens_needed += 1
                total_cells = 15
        
        print(screens_needed)

func()
```

This solution correctly calculates the number of screens needed by first placing the 2x2 icons and then placing the 1x1 icons in the remaining space, ensuring the minimum number of screens is used.
