Output State: `cw` is False, `nums` is a list of integers where each element has been decremented by the cumulative sum of all previous elements in `nums`, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`.

Explanation: The loop iterates from the second last element to the second element of the `nums` list. If the current element is 1, `cw` is toggled; otherwise, it is set to `True`. Since the loop starts from the end and moves towards the beginning, the final value of `cw` will depend on the number of 1s encountered. Given the loop structure, `cw` will be False at the end because the loop will eventually encounter a non-1 value, setting `cw` to `True` and then not changing it again. The `nums` and `ls` variables remain unaffected by the loop, so their states remain as in the initial state.
