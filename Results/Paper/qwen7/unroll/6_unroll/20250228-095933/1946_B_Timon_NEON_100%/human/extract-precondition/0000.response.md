Precondition: **number is an integer, and quantity is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= quantity <= 2 * 10^5.** 

The provided function `func_3` seems to be incomplete and does not directly relate to the problem description. It takes two parameters, `number` and `quantity`, but does not utilize them in the given code snippet. Based on the problem description, the function should likely involve manipulating the array and performing operations related to the number of operations (`quantity`) to maximize the sum of the array. However, without the full implementation, we can only describe the preconditions for the parameters as given.
