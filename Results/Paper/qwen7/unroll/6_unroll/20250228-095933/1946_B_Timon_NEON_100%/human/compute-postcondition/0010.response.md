Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `segment`, which is being iterated over from the list `segments_variants`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `segments_variants` is currently `['new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]']`.
   - `new_segment` is an empty list.
   - `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`.
   - `max_sum` is `-1`.
   - `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `segments_variants`. Since `segments_variants` is a list containing one element, the loop will execute exactly once.

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - The only variable directly involved in the loop head is `segment`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `segment` is set to the first and only element of `segments_variants`, which is `'new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]'`.

5. **Ensure other variables are consistent with the loop's context**:
   - `new_segment` should remain as an empty list since it is not modified within the loop head.
   - `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and `total_max_segment` are not directly involved in the loop head, so their values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`segment` is `'new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]'`, `new_segment` is an empty list**
