### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the sum of an array `a` through `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code has three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
   - `func_1` correctly computes the remainder of a number when divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `func_3` is never called in the provided code, so it is irrelevant to the correctness of the solution.
   - `func_2` is supposed to find the segment with the maximum sum, but it has a critical flaw in its logic.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - The function attempts to find the segment with the maximum sum in the array `arr`.
   - The logic inside the loop is flawed:
     - `new_segment` and `max_segment` are not properly initialized or updated.
     - The `segments_variants` list is incorrectly appended.
     - The final return statement returns the last index of the array, which is not the intended behavior.

4. **Impact on the Main Program**:
   - The main program calls `func_2` to get `max_segment`, which is used to calculate the final answer.
   - Since `func_2` returns the last index of the array instead of the segment with the maximum sum, the calculation of the final answer will be incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because `func_2` does not correctly find the segment with the maximum sum. Therefore, the final answer calculated in the main program will be incorrect.

### Response:
Correctness: **False**
