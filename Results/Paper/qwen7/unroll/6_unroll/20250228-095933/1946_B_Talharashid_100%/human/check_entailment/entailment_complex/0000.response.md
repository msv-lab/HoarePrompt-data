Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that adding the sum of a subarray `k` times effectively multiplies the sum of that subarray by `2^k`. The goal is to maximize the sum by strategically choosing subarrays whose sums are maximized.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The code iterates through the array to calculate the maximum prefix sum (`maxi`) considering both positive and negative contributions.
   - It then uses the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` to compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
   - The formula accounts for the fact that adding the sum of a subarray `k` times contributes `2^k * maxi`, but we subtract `maxi` once to avoid double-counting the initial sum.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles negative numbers correctly by resetting the running sum (`c`) when encountering a negative number whose absolute value is less than or equal to the current running sum (`c`).
   - The use of modulo `1000000007` ensures the result fits within the required constraints.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The annotated program correctly processes all provided test cases, including edge cases like all negative numbers, all zeros, and large values.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum after `k` operations and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
