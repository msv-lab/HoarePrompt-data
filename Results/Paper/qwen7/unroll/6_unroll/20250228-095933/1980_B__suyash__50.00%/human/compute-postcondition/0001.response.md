Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(t):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` is an integer input from the user, and its value is between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(t)` will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
   - Since `t` is an integer input, it will always be a non-negative integer. Given the constraint that `t` is between 1 and 1000, `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 so that the loop can start executing.
   - `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
