Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes after sorting. Here is an example that demonstrates this issue:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  5 2 2
  4 3 3 2 3
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - "MAYBE" because after sorting, the array becomes `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`. The favorite cube (3) could end up in the second or third position, so it might or might not be removed depending on the exact order of the other cubes.

- **Actual Output:**
  - The program incorrectly prints "NO".

The program fails to consider all possible positions of the favorite cube after sorting and the impact of removing the first `k` cubes. It only checks if the favorite cube is in a position greater than `k-1` after sorting, which is not sufficient to determine the correct outcome.
