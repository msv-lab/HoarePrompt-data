Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic used to calculate the minimum number of characters to be removed to make the string beautiful aligns with the problem statement.

1. **Problem Statement**: A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". To achieve this, we need to remove the minimum number of characters.

2. **Given Logic**:
   - The program counts the number of occurrences of the substrings "map", "pie", and "mapie".
   - It then calculates the result using the formula `x + y - z`, where:
     - `x` is the count of "map".
     - `y` is the count of "pie".
     - `z` is the count of "mapie".

3. **Analysis**:
   - The formula `x + y - z` is used to calculate the minimum deletions needed. 
   - Each occurrence of "mapie" should be counted only once since it overlaps both "map" and "pie". Hence, subtracting `z` from `x + y` ensures that overlapping substrings are not double-counted.
   - This approach correctly identifies the minimum deletions required to eliminate all instances of "pie" and "map" without double-counting the overlap.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string does not contain either "pie" or "map", the formula will yield 0, which is correct.
   - If the string contains "mapie", it will be counted once, ensuring no double counting.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the given program accurately calculates the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
