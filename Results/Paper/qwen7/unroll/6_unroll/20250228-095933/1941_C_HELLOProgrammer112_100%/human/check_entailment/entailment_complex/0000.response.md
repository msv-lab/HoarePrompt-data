Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map", "pie", and "mapie" in the input string `s` for each test case. The expression `x + y - z` is used to calculate the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. Here's the breakdown:

- `x` is the number of occurrences of the substring "map".
- `y` is the number of occurrences of the substring "pie".
- `z` is the number of occurrences of the substring "mapie".

For each occurrence of "mapie", it is counted twice in `x` and `y`, but it should only be counted once since it is a valid sequence that makes the string ugly. Therefore, subtracting `z` from `x + y` gives the correct count of the minimum deletions needed to remove all instances of "map" and "pie" while avoiding double-counting "mapie".

Given the logic, the program correctly calculates the minimum deletions required to make the string beautiful. However, the problem statement specifies that the goal is to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful, which means removing all instances of "map" and "pie" while ensuring no "mapie" remains.

The program's approach of using `x + y - z` is mathematically sound for achieving this goal. Thus, the program correctly implements the solution.

Correctness: **True**
