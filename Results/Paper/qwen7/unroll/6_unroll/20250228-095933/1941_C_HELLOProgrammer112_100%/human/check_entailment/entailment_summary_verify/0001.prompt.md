You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        z = s.count('mapie')
        print(x + y - z)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t`, a positive integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of the substrings "map", "pie", and "mapie" in the string `s`. It then calculates and prints the result of the expression `x + y - z`, where `x` is the count of "map", `y` is the count of "pie", and `z` is the count of "mapie". The final output is a list of these results for all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to make it "beautiful". A string is considered "beautiful" if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - The given solution counts the occurrences of "map", "pie", and "mapie" in the string.
   - The logic behind the solution is flawed because it incorrectly assumes that counting "map" and "pie" separately and subtracting the count of "mapie" will give the correct result.

2. **Flaw in the Solution**:
   - Counting "map" and "pie" separately and subtracting the count of "mapie" does not account for overlapping substrings correctly. For example, in the string "mapie", both "map" and "pie" are present, but they overlap at the "pie" part. The current approach would count this twice and then subtract once, which is incorrect.
   - The solution should consider the positions of these substrings and remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate both "pie" and "map".

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Iterate through the string and find the first occurrence of "pie" or "map".
   - Remove the minimum number of characters needed to break the sequence of "pie" or "map".
   - Continue this process until no more "pie" or "map" substrings are found.

### Conclusion:
The given solution is incorrect because it does not properly handle overlapping substrings and does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions.

### Correctness:
**False**
