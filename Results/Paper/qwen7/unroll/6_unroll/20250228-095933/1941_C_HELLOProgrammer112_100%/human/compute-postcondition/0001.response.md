Output State: The output state is a series of integers printed for each test case, where each integer represents the value of `x + y - z` for the corresponding test case. Here, `x` is the number of occurrences of the substring "map", `y` is the number of occurrences of the substring "pie", and `z` is the number of occurrences of the substring "mapie". The loop processes each test case independently, counting these substrings in the given string `s` and printing the result of `x + y - z`.
