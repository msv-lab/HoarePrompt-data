Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used to calculate the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful is flawed. Specifically, the program counts the occurrences of "map", "pie", and "mapie" but does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to minimize deletions.

To make the string beautiful, we need to remove the minimum number of characters such that neither "pie" nor "map" appears as a substring. The current approach does not achieve this goal because:

1. Counting "map" and "pie" separately does not consider the overlap between these substrings.
2. Counting "mapie" does not help in determining the minimum deletions needed since "mapie" is a specific sequence and does not represent the general case of "map" or "pie".

A correct solution would involve iterating through the string and keeping track of whether we have encountered "m" or "p" without immediately counting deletions. We can then decide at each step whether to delete the current character or keep it based on the substring conditions.

Correctness: **False**
