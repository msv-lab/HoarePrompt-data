Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

Note: Since the function signature does not explicitly include parameters, the description focuses on the implied input and output behavior based on the provided constraints and output cases.
