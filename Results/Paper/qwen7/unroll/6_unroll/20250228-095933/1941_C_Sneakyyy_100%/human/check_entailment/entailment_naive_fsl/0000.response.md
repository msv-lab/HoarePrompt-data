Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the string contains overlapping substrings like "pie" or "map". For example, in the input "ppiee", the program would only remove one 'e' because it checks for substrings of length 3 and moves forward by 3 characters after finding a match. This means it fails to recognize that removing just one character ('i') would make the string beautiful. Therefore, the program does not always remove the minimum number of characters required to make the string beautiful.
