Output State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**

The code `t = int(input().strip())` reads an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and converts it to an integer. This integer is then assigned to the variable `t`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial state.
