Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is used as a throwaway variable) and `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0. The other variables (`results`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and can remain as they are.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters**
