Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if for any index `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such an index is found, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
   - This logic correctly identifies if there is a possible template where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. It essentially checks if there is a mismatch pattern that can be used as a template.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, and then calls `func_1` to determine if a valid template exists.
   - It collects the results of `func_1` for each test case and prints them out. The logic here is correct as it follows the problem statement precisely.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The main function `__name__ == '__main__': func_2()` correctly initializes the process by calling `func_2`.
   - The program handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement and prints the correct output for each test case.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
