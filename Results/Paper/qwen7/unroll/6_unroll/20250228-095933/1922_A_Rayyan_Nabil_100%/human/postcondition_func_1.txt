The function reads multiple sets of inputs, each consisting of an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (length of strings), and three strings \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) (each of length \( n \)). For each set of inputs, it calls another function `func_1` to process the strings and stores the result. After processing all sets, it prints the results of each set. The function does not return any value but modifies an internal list `results` which contains the processed outputs for each test case.
