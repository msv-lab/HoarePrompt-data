Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, the value of `t` remains within this range after the input is taken. The variables `n` and `k` are not defined or affected by this line of code, so they retain their initial unspecified positive integer values between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
