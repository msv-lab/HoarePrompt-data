Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. The logic inside the loop and the conditions used to calculate `suma` do not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the formula used to calculate `x` and the conditions to increment `suma` are incorrect. The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), which is not being properly handled in the provided code.
