### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the problem description step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a different approach. It iterates through possible values of \(i\) from 1 to \(b\) and calculates a value \(x\) based on a specific formula. However, the logic used to determine the number of valid pairs does not align with the problem requirements.

Here's the problematic part of the program:
```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
    if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
        suma += x
        if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
            suma += 1
```

This loop and the conditions inside it do not correctly reflect the problem's constraints. Specifically:
- The expression \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) does not seem to have a clear connection to the problem's conditions.
- The conditions \((a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0\) are not relevant to the problem's requirements.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). It prints the count of such pairs for each test case.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The logic used in the program does not match the problem's requirements, leading to incorrect results.

**Final: False**
