Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem. The key issue lies in the formula used to calculate `suma`. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The given code attempts to solve this problem using a different approach that involves iterating over possible values of \(i\) up to \(b\) and applying a specific formula. However, the formula and logic used in the code do not align with the requirements of the problem.

Here's a brief breakdown of why the current implementation is incorrect:
- The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not correctly represent the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
- The condition `if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is not relevant to the problem constraints and does not contribute to the correct count of pairs.
- The overall logic for counting valid pairs \((a, b)\) is flawed and does not satisfy the problem's requirements.

Given these issues, the provided implementation does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
