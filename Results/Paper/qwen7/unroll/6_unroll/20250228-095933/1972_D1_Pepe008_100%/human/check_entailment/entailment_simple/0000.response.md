Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Let's break down the issue step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code attempts to iterate through possible values of \(i\) from 1 to \(b\) and calculates \(x\) using the formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i(i-1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\).
   - It checks if this value of \(x\) is greater than 0 and adds it to `suma`.
   - It also checks additional conditions involving divisibility but these conditions are not aligned with the problem requirements.

3. **Incorrect Implementation**:
   - The formula used in the code does not align with the problem statement. Specifically, it does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The logic inside the loop does not properly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The final output is `suma - 2`, which is not relevant to the problem requirements.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition directly.
   - For each pair, compute \(\gcd(a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
