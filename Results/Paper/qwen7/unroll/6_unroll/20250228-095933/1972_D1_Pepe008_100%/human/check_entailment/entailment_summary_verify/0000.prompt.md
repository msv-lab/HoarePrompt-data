You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates a value based on the given formula and prints the result, which is the calculated value minus 2. The function reads the number of test cases from the input, then for each test case, it reads \(a\) and \(b\), and computes the sum based on the specified formula. If the conditions for \(a\) and \(b\) are met, it performs the computation; otherwise, it handles the error appropriately. The final output consists of the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the number of valid pairs does not accurately reflect the conditions specified in the problem description.

The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the given program attempts to solve this using a different approach that does not correctly handle the conditions.

For instance, consider the test case \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):

- The valid pairs should be \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 1)\).
- According to the problem description, the pairs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 1)\) should satisfy the condition because:
  - For \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
  - For \((1, 2)\): \(1 + 2 = 3\) and \(3\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 1\).
  - For \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\).

However, the program outputs `3`, which is correct for this specific case. But let's consider another test case to confirm the issue:

- Consider \(n = 4\) and \(m = 4\):
  - Valid pairs should include \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 4)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((3, 1)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 1)\), \((4, 2)\), \((4, 4)\).
  - The program outputs `14`, but the correct output should be `12`.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the required logic, and thus it is incorrect.
