### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\),
2. \(1 \le b \le m\),
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The program uses a loop to iterate through all possible values of \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - It calculates \(x\) as \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i(i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\).
   - If \(x > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - It also checks if \((a - i(i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i(i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\). If both conditions are true, it adds 1 to `suma`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all values of \(i\) for a given \(a\) and \(b\), it prints `suma - 2`.

#### Key Points to Check:
1. **Condition Checking**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly checked in the program.
   - Instead, the program uses a different heuristic involving \(i\) and \(i^2\).

2. **Heuristic vs. Correct Solution**:
   - The heuristic used in the program does not match the problem requirements. It seems to be an attempt to approximate the solution rather than directly solving the problem.
   - The conditions \((a - i(i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i(i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) do not correctly reflect the problem constraints.

3. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the test case \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the program correctly outputs `3`, which matches the expected result.
   - However, for the test case \(n = 4\) and \(m = 4\), the program outputs `14`, while the correct answer should be `12`. This indicates a logical error in the program's approach.

4. **General Validation**:
   - Given the discrepancy between the expected and actual results, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem due to the incorrect heuristic used in the calculation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
