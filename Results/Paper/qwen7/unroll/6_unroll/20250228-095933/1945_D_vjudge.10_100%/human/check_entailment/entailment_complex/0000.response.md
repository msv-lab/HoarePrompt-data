Reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it correctly reads the values of \( n \) and \( m \), and the lists \( a \) and \( b \).
3. The function `func_1` is called with these parameters.
4. In `func_1`, the variable `pergunta` is initialized to infinity, which is appropriate for finding the minimum cost.
5. The function iterates backward through the list `a` and `b` from index \( n-1 \) to 0.
6. For each index \( i \):
   - If \( i < m \), it updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and \( x + a[i] \).
   - It adds the minimum of \( a[i] \) and \( b[i] \) to \( x \).
7. After processing all elements, it prints the value of `pergunta`.
8. The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the problem's requirements:
   - It considers the cost of moving Kirill to positions before \( m \).
   - It accumulates the minimum cost for each position.
   - It ensures that the final position of Kirill is within the first \( m \) positions.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
