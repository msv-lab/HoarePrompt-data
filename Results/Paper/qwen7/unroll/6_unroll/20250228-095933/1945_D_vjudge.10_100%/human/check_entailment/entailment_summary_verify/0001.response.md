### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the key points to ensure the reasoning is sound:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the necessary inputs for each test case.
   - The lists `a` and `b` are read and stored properly.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes `pergunta` to infinity, ensuring that any valid cost will be smaller.
   - The variable `x` accumulates the cost of moving through the queue.
   - The loop iterates backward from `n-1` to `0`, ensuring that the cost of moving through the queue is calculated correctly.
   - For each position `i`, it checks if `i < m`. If true, it updates `pergunta` with the minimum cost of moving to position `i`.
   - The variable `x` is updated by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to it.

3. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the function prints the value of `pergunta`, which should be the minimum cost.

Given the function summary, the logic in `func_1` correctly accounts for the cost of moving Kirill to a position within the first `m` people. The backward iteration ensures that the cost of moving through the queue is calculated correctly, and the initialization of `pergunta` to infinity ensures that the minimum cost is found. The condition `i < m` correctly identifies the positions where Kirill should stop moving.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

This confirms that the original assessment was accurate.
