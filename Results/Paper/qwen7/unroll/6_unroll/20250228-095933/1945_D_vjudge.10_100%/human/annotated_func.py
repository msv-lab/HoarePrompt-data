#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is a string, a and b are lists of integers where 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= b[i] <= 10^9 for all i, n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000 and the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: Output State: pergunta is the minimum value between pergunta and (x + a[i]) for all i < m, x is the sum of the minimum values between a[i] and b[i] for all i in the range of n-1 to 0.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum value between itself and (x + a[i]) for all i < m)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two lists of integers, `a` and `b`, along with indices `n` and `m`. It updates the initial value of `pergunta` by comparing it with the sum of certain elements from `a` and `b`. Specifically, it calculates the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` from index `n-1` down to `0`. If the current index is less than `m`, it also updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and the sum of the current element of `a` and the running total `x`. Finally, it prints the updated value of `pergunta`.
