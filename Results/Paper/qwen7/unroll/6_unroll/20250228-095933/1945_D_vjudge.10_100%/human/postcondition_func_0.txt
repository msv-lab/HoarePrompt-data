The function processes two lists of integers, `a` and `b`, along with indices `n` and `m`. It updates the initial value of `pergunta` by comparing it with the sum of certain elements from `a` and `b`. Specifically, it calculates the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` from index `n-1` down to `0`. If the current index is less than `m`, it also updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and the sum of the current element of `a` and the running total `x`. Finally, it prints the updated value of `pergunta`.
