Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer \( n \) (where \( 3 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)). For each \( n \), it constructs a list \( p \) of length \( n \) where the elements at even indices are filled with decreasing even numbers starting from \( n \) down to 2, and the elements at odd indices are filled with increasing even numbers starting from 1 up to \( n-1 \) if \( n \) is odd, or \( n+1 \) if \( n \) is even. The function then prints the list \( p \) for each test case.**
