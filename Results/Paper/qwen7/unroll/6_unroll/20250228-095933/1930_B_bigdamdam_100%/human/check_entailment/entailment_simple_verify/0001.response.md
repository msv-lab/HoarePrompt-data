### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) exist where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) of the permutation.
   - It initializes an array `p` of size \( n \) with zeros.
   - It then fills the array in a specific pattern:
     - For even indices (starting from 0), it assigns values starting from \( n \) and decrementing by 2.
     - For odd indices (starting from 1), it assigns values starting from \( 1 + n \% 2 \) and incrementing by 2.

3. **Checking the Pattern**:
   - Let's consider an example for \( n = 4 \):
     - The array `p` starts as `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.
     - For even indices: `p[0] = 4`, `p[2] = 2`.
     - For odd indices: `p[1] = 1`, `p[3] = 3`.
     - So, the final array `p` is `[4, 1, 2, 3]`.

4. **Verification**:
   - Check if the generated permutation `[4, 1, 2, 3]` meets the criteria:
     - \( p_1 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_2 = 1 \).
     - \( p_2 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 2 \).
     - \( p_3 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 3 \).
     - \( p_1 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 2 \).
     - \( p_2 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 3 \).
   - This permutation is valid.

5. **General Case**:
   - For any \( n \), the pattern ensures that no two adjacent elements in the permutation will have the property that one divides the other because the values are assigned in a strictly increasing/decreasing manner.

However, upon closer inspection, the original assessment overlooks a critical aspect of the problem statement. The problem requires that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) should satisfy both \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \). The provided solution only checks the divisibility condition between adjacent elements, which is insufficient.

Let's consider another example to illustrate the flaw:
- For \( n = 6 \):
  - The array `p` would be `[6, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3]`.
  - Checking the condition:
    - \( p_1 = 6 \) divides \( p_3 = 4 \) (since \( 6 \div 4 = 1.5 \) is not an integer, this is not a problem).
    - \( p_2 = 1 \) divides \( p_4 = 2 \) (since \( 1 \div 2 = 0.5 \) is not an integer, this is not a problem).
    - \( p_3 = 4 \) divides \( p_5 = 5 \) (since \( 4 \div 5 = 0.8 \) is not an integer, this is not a problem).
    - \( p_4 = 2 \) divides \( p_6 = 3 \) (since \( 2 \div 3 = 0.6667 \) is not an integer, this is not a problem).
    - However, \( p_1 = 6 \) divides \( p_5 = 5 \) (since \( 6 \div 5 = 1.2 \) is not an integer, this is not a problem).
    - \( p_2 = 1 \) divides \( p_6 = 3 \) (since \( 1 \div 3 = 0.3333 \) is not an integer, this is not a problem).

While the above example does not violate the condition directly, it shows that the solution does not guarantee that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) will satisfy both \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \) for larger \( n \).

### Conclusion:
