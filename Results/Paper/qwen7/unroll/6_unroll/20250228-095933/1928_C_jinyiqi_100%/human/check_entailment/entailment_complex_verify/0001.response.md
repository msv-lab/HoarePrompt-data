### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit into the described settling pattern.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - The position \( n \) and number \( x \) must satisfy certain conditions related to \( k \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the position \( n \) and the number \( x \).
   - It checks two conditions:
     1. \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \)
     2. \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \)
   - If either condition is true, it calls `func_1` to get the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) or \( n - x \).
   - It filters these divisors to find those that satisfy \( (s + 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \).
   - It removes duplicates using `set` and prints the length of the resulting list.

3. **Checking the Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` returns all divisors of \( x \), including both proper and improper divisors.
   - It ensures that the divisors are returned in a specific order (reversed order of factors).

4. **Verifying the Conditions:**
   - The conditions \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \) ensure that \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even.
   - These even numbers are used to find possible \( k \) values by checking the divisors.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases where \( n \) and \( x \) might not directly give valid \( k \) values but still checks the conditions.
   - The filtering ensures that only valid \( k \) values are counted.

### Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State:**
  - \( n \) and \( x \) are read from input, with \( 1 \le x < n \le 10^9 \).

- **Condition 1: \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \):**
  - This condition ensures that \( n + x - 2 \) is even.
  - If true, `func_1(n + x - 2)` is called to find divisors.
  - Divisors are filtered to ensure \( (s + 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \).

- **Condition 2: \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \):**
  - This condition ensures that \( n - x \) is even.
  - If true, `func_1(n - x)` is called to find divisors.
  - Divisors are filtered similarly.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - Returns all divisors of \( x \) in a specific order.
  - This helps in finding valid \( k \) values.

- **Final Output:**
  - The unique valid \( k \) values are counted and printed.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the number of possible \( k \) values that fit the given constraints. The conditions and the function `func_1` are correctly applied to filter out the valid \( k \) values.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
