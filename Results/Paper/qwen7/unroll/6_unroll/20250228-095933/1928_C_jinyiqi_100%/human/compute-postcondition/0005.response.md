Output State: **`output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, but in reverse order; `output2` is a list containing all corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `output1.reverse()` reverses the list `output1` in place. This means that while the original content of `output1` remains the same (all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`), the order of elements in `output1` is now reversed. The value of `output2` remains unchanged, as it was not affected by the code.
