### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Validation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - It validates the input values for each test case, ensuring `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates all divisors of a given number `x`. 
   - It correctly identifies all divisors by iterating up to the square root of `x` and then appending the corresponding larger divisors.
   - The returned list is the concatenation of divisors greater than the square root and those less than or equal to the square root in reverse order.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic checks two conditions:
     - If `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`, it calls `func_1` on `n + x - 2` and processes the results.
     - If `(n - x) % 2 == 0`, it calls `func_1` on `n - x` and processes the results.
   - For each divisor `s` obtained from `func_1`, it checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
   - It appends valid divisors to the `output` list and ensures no duplicates by converting the list to a set before returning its length.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where `k = 1` is explicitly excluded since the settling does not exist for `k = 1`.
   - The program correctly identifies when no valid `k` exists (as seen in the fourth test case).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid `k` values based on the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
