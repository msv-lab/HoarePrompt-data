Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining how many values of \( k \) fit the given conditions for a given position \( n \) and number \( x \) that Vasya received during the settling process. The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The settling pattern involves numbers from 1 to \( k \) repeating in a specific manner.
   - The position \( n \) and number \( x \) must fit within the repeating pattern.
   - The function `func_1` calculates all divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \), which are used to find possible values of \( k \).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly finds all divisors of \( x \) and returns them in a specific order (reverse of divisors less than or equal to the square root, followed by their corresponding larger divisors).
   - This is used to identify potential values of \( k \) by checking if \( k \) divides \( n + x - 2 \) or \( n - x \).

4. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - The main logic checks if \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even, ensuring they can be divided into segments of length \( 2k - 2 \).
   - It then uses the divisors found by `func_1` to check if they can form valid \( k \) values where \( k \geq x \).

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \) are handled correctly.
   - The solution ensures that the number of valid \( k \) values is finite and correctly counted.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
