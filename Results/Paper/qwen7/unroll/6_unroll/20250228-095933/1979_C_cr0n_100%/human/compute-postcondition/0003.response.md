Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `x` and the list `vals`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `N` is an input integer.
   - `vals` is a list of `N` integers where each integer \( k_i \) satisfies \( 2 \leq k_i \leq 20 \).
   - `den` is the first element of the list `vals`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `vals`. The loop will start with `x` being equal to the first element of `vals`, which is `den`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `x` being the first element of `vals`, we need to ensure that `vals` is a valid list with at least one element (which it is, as it has `N` elements).
   - We don't need to adjust `N` or `den` because they are not directly involved in the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `vals` must be a list with at least one element (which it is, as it has `N` elements).

Given this reasoning, the final state adjustment is:

State: **`vals` is a list of `N` integers where each integer \( k_i \) satisfies \( 2 \leq k_i \leq 20 \)**
