Output State: **N is an input integer, and vals is a list of N integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20.**

Explanation: The code `N = int(input().strip())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `N`. The initial state of `vals` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on `vals`. The precondition that `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50 is maintained, and the precondition about `vals` remains valid as well.
