Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list `arr` containing `n-1` integers.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `ans` of length `n` with zeros.
   - `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`.
   - For each subsequent index `i` from 1 to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is calculated as the sum of `arr[i-1]` and all previous `ans` values until it exceeds `arr[i]`. This ensures that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true.
   - Finally, `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic ensures that `a_i` is always greater than or equal to `a_{i-1}`.
   - The condition `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` is satisfied for all `2 \leq i \leq n`.
   - The values of `a_i` are within the specified bounds (1 to \(10^9\)).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program correctly finds an array `a_1, \dots, a_n` that satisfies the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
