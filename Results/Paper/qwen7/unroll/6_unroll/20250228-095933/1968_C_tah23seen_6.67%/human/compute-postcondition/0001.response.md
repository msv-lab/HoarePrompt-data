Output State: **arr is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive, ans is a list of n zeros with ans[0] = arr[0] + 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the first element of the `ans` list by adding 1 to the first element of the `arr` list. All other elements of `ans` remain zero, and the `arr` list remains unchanged in terms of its contents.
