#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: arr is a list of n-1 integers, ans is a list of n integers where ans[0] equals arr[0] + 1, and for every i from 1 to n-1, ans[i] equals the sum of arr[i-1] and all previous ans values until it exceeds arr[i].
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for every `i` from `1` to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is the sum of `arr[i-1]` and all previous `ans` values until it exceeds `arr[i]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers (where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive) and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`), it is the sum of `arr[i-1]` and all previous `ans` values until it exceeds the corresponding element in `arr`. The last element `ans[-1]` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and the last element of `arr`.
