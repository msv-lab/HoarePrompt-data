Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of n-1 integers where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive, and `n`, which is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for every `i` from `1` to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is the sum of `arr[i-1]` and all previous `ans` values until it exceeds `arr[i]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.**
