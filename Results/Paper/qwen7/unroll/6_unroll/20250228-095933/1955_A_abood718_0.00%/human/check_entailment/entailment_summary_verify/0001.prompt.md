You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates and prints one of three possible outputs based on the values of \(a\) and \(b\):
- If \(2b < c\), it prints \(a \times b\).
- If \(a\) is even, it prints \(\frac{a \times c}{2}\).
- If \(a\) is odd, it first prints \(\frac{a}{2}\) (integer division), followed by \(\frac{a}{2} \times c + b\).

After processing all test cases, the function outputs a series of lines, each corresponding to the output of a single test case, without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` representing the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

2. **Promotion Price Comparison:**
   - The program checks if the price for two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the price of one yogurt (`2 * B`).
     - If `2 * B < C`, it means it's cheaper to buy two yogurts at the promotion price. In this case, the total cost is `A * B`.
     - Otherwise, it's better to use the promotion price for pairs of yogurts.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A` (the number of yogurts) is even, the program calculates the cost as `(A / 2) * C`. This is because you can perfectly pair all yogurts with the promotion.

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A` is odd, the program calculates the cost as follows:
     - It buys as many pairs as possible using the promotion, which is `A // 2` pairs.
     - It then buys the remaining one yogurt at the regular price `B`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case.

### Detailed Example Walkthrough

Let's go through the examples provided in the problem statement:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Here, `A = 2`, `B = 5`, and `C = 9`.
   - Since `2 * B = 10 > 9`, we use the promotion price.
   - Cost = `2 * 5 = 10` (but the output is `9` in the example, indicating a potential error).

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Here, `A = 3`, `B = 5`, and `C = 9`.
   - Since `2 * B = 10 > 9`, we use the promotion price.
   - Cost = `1 * 9 + 1 * 5 = 14` (but the output is `14` in the example, which is correct).

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Here, `A = 3`, `B = 5`, and `C = 11`.
   - Since `2 * B = 10 < 11`, we use the regular price for each yogurt.
   - Cost = `3 * 5 = 15` (which matches the example output).

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Here, `A = 4`, `B = 5`, and `C = 11`.
   - Since `2 * B = 10 < 11`, we use the regular price for each yogurt.
   - Cost = `4 * 5 = 20` (which matches the example output).

### Conclusion

Upon reviewing the logic and the example outputs, it appears that the program has a logical flaw in the first test case. Specifically, when `A = 2`, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as `A * B` instead of using the promotion price.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where `A` is even and the promotion price is cheaper than the regular price for two yogurts.
