### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the example cases.

#### Problem Description and Example Cases:
- We need to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly \( n \) yogurts.
- There are two pricing options: 
  - Regular price: \( a \) burles per yogurt.
  - Promotion price: \( b \) burles for two yogurts.

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost based on the values of \( a \) and \( b \).
- The logic is as follows:
  - If \( 2b < c \), print \( a \times b \).
  - If \( a \) is even, print \( \frac{a \times c}{2} \).
  - If \( a \) is odd, print \( \frac{a}{2} \) (integer division) followed by \( \frac{a}{2} \times c + b \).

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
```

#### Analysis:
1. **Case 1: \( 2b < c \)**
   - The program correctly prints \( A \times B \) when \( 2b < c \).
   - This matches the logic in the function summary.

2. **Case 2: \( a \) is even**
   - The program correctly prints \( \frac{A \times C}{2} \) when \( a \) is even.
   - This also matches the logic in the function summary.

3. **Case 3: \( a \) is odd**
   - The program prints \( \frac{A}{2} \) followed by \( \frac{A}{2} \times C + B \).
   - According to the function summary, it should directly print the minimum cost, which is \( \frac{A}{2} \times C + B \).

However, the provided program prints the intermediate value \( \frac{A}{2} \) and then the full cost, which is not the correct approach. It should directly compute and print the minimum cost.

#### Corrected Version:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all potential cases. Specifically, for the case where \( n \) is odd and \( B * 2 >= C \), the program incorrectly prints intermediate values instead of the direct minimum cost.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
