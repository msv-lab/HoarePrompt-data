Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, where each line represents the result of one iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if \(B \times 2 < C\), the output will be \(A \times B\). If \(A\) is even, the output will be \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\). Otherwise, the output will be two lines: \(X = \frac{A}{2}\) and \(X \times C + B\).

The number of lines in the output will be equal to the number of test cases specified by the first input integer \(t\). Each line's content depends on the values of \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) for each test case.
