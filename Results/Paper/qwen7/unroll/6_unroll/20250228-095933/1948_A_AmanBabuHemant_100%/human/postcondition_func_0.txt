The function processes multiple test cases, each involving an integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 50 \)). For each \( n \), it checks if \( n \) is odd or even. If \( n \) is odd, it prints "NO". If \( n \) is even, it constructs a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated \( \frac{n}{2} \) times. If the constructed string length is less than 200 characters, it prints "YES" followed by the string; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.
