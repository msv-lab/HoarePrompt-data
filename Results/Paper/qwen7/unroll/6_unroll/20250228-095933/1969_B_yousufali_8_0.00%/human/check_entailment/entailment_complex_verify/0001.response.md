### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. The cost of an operation is the length of the substring chosen for a cyclic shift.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, which is not consistent with the problem statement where the input is a binary string.
   - It splits the input string into a list of integers, which is incorrect because the input should be treated as a string.
   - The logic inside the loop is trying to count the number of 1s before a 0 appears and adding the cost (length of that segment plus one) to the answer. This logic does not correctly simulate the cyclic shift operation required to sort the string.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - However, since `func_1` is incorrectly implemented, it will not solve the problem correctly.

4. **Expected Solution**:
   - To solve this problem, we need to identify segments of 1s and 0s and calculate the cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string.
   - The correct approach involves identifying the longest segment of 0s and calculating the cost to move all 1s to the front.

### Detailed Analysis Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
- **Processing Each Test Case**:
  - For each test case, the binary string `s` is read as a list of integers.
  - The function `func_1` is called with this list.
  - Inside `func_1`, the list `s` is split into a list of integers, which is incorrect. It should be treated as a string.
  - The function attempts to count segments of consecutive 1s and add their lengths to the answer, but it does not correctly simulate the cyclic shift operation.
  - The variable `n` is used to count the number of consecutive 1s, and `ans` is incremented by `n + 1` when a 0 is encountered. This logic does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

### Conclusion:

- The function `func_1` incorrectly processes the input and does not simulate the required cyclic shifts.
- The function `func_2` calls `func_1` for each test case, but since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall solution is flawed.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the cyclic shift operations needed to sort the binary string.
