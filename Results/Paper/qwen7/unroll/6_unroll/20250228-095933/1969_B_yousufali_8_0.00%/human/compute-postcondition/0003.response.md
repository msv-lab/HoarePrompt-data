The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, a binary string `s` is provided on a new line with the length of the string satisfying 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `t` and process `t` test cases where each test case involves a binary string `s`. However, since no specific return value is mentioned, it implies the function might be performing some operations or validations on the binary strings without returning any result.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and processes each test case involving a binary string `s` of length between 2 and 2⋅10^5.**
