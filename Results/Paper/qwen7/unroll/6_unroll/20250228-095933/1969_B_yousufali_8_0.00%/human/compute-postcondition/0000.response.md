Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This integer is stored in the variable `t`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, specifically, no additional binary strings are read yet, and the variable `t` now holds the number of test cases as an integer.
