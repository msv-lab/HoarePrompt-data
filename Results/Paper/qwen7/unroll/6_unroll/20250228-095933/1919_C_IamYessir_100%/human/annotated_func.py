#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

    #State: Output State: The value of `s`, which is the count of increasing subsequences in both lists `a` and `b` combined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a list of n integers. For each test case, it divides the list into two sublists, `a` and `b`, based on certain conditions involving the last elements of these sublists. It then counts the number of increasing subsequences in both sublists combined and prints the total count.
