Output State: `left` is a list containing 0; `last` is a list where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the respective element in the array `a`; `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1.

To explain further, the `last` list keeps track of the most recent index at which each value in the array `a` appears. The `left` list remains unchanged as it only contains the initial value of 0. The `ans` list is not affected by the loop and retains its initial state of all elements being -1.
