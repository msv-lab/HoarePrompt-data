Output State: **`left` is a list containing 0.**

The initial state defines that `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the sizes of the slimes, and `n` is a positive integer within the specified range. The code snippet initializes `left` as a list containing a single element, which is `0`. No changes are made to the list `a`, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the only change is that `left` is now a list containing the integer `0`.
