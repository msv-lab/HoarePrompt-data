### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to ensure its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`
This function is used to find the position of the smallest element greater than or equal to `x` in the list `a`. It uses binary search via `bisect_left`.

```python
def func_1(a, x):
    if x < 0:
        return -1
    inx = bl(a, x)
    if a[inx] == x:
        return inx + 1
    return inx
```

- **Correctness**: This function is correct. It returns the index of the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`. If such an element does not exist, it returns `-1`.

#### Function `func_2`
This function aims to calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime.

```python
def func_2(a, n):
    left = [0]
    last = [-1]
    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
    return ans
```

1. **Initialization:**
   - `left` is initialized with `[0]` to store cumulative sums.
   - `last` is initialized with `[-1]` to keep track of the last index where the value was different from the current one.
   - `ans` is initialized with `[-1] * n` to store the result for each slime.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - For each element in `a`, we append the cumulative sum to `left`.

3. **Finding the Nearest Smaller Slime:**
   - For each slime at index `i`, if it is smaller than the previous one (`a[i] < a[i - 1]`), it will be eaten immediately, so `ans[i] = 1`.
   - Otherwise, we calculate `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1`, which represents the sum of sizes of all slimes before the current slime minus the size of the current slime minus one (to account for the current slime itself).
   - We use `func_1` to find the index of the smallest prefix sum greater than `x`.
   - `inx2` is set to `last[i - 1]` to handle cases where the current slime could have been eaten by a previous slime of the same size.
   - If `inx2` is less than `inx`, we update `inx` to `inx2`.
   - If `inx` is still negative, we skip this slime.
   - Otherwise, we compute the time taken as `i + 1 - inx` and store it in `ans[i]`.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Initialization and Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - The initialization of `left` and `last` is correct.
   - The cumulative sum calculation in `left` is also correct.

2. **Handling Immediate Eaten Slimes:**
   - The logic for immediate eating (`a[i] < a[i - 1]`) is correct and sets `ans[i] = 1`.

3. **Finding the Nearest Smaller Slime:**
   - The use of `func_1` to find the appropriate index is correct.
   - The handling of `inx2` to account for previous slimes of the same size is correct.
   - The final computation of `ans[i]` is correct.

### Edge Cases and Examples

1. **Single Slime:**
   - If there is only one slime, it will never be eaten, so the result should be `-1`.
   - The program correctly handles this case by initializing `ans` with `-1`.

2. **Multiple Slimes of Same Size:**
   - If multiple slimes have the same size, they will be handled correctly by using `last` to track the last index of the previous slime of the same size.

3. **Slimes of Different Sizes:**
   - The program correctly calculates the time for each slime to be eaten based on the cumulative sums and the positions of the nearest larger slimes.

### Conclusion

After a detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime. The edge cases and examples provided in the original assessment are handled correctly.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
