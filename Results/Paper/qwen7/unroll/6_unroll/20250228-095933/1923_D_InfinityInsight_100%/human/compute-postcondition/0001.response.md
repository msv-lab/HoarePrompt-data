Output State: **`left` is a list containing 0; `last` is a list containing -1**

The initial state of `left` is a list containing 0. The code assigns `-1` to the variable `last`, which is also a list. Therefore, after executing the code, `left` remains unchanged as a list containing 0, and `last` becomes a list containing -1.
