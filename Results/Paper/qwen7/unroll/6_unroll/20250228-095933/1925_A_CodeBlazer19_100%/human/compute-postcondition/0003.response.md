Output State: The output consists of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' repeated 'n' times for each iteration, with the length of the string being capped at 'k'. This process repeats 't' times, where 't' is the initial value of `t`. Each line of output corresponds to one iteration of the loop, with the value of 'n' and 'k' provided as input for that iteration.
