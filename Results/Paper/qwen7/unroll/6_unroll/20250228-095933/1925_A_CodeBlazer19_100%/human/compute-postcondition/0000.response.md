Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, and `t` is now the integer input value.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is an integer within the specified range (1 to 676), the precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676 remains valid. The value of `t` is updated to the integer input value. Variables `n` and `k` are not affected by this code, so their preconditions remain unchanged.
