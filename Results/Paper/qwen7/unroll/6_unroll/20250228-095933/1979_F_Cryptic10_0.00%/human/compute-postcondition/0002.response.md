The only variable in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `remaining_vertices`. For the loop to execute the first time, `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one element.

Given that `remaining_vertices` is a set containing elements from 1 to `n` inclusive, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, the set will always contain at least one element (since the smallest possible value for `n` is 2).

Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute the first time because the condition `remaining_vertices` being non-empty is already satisfied.

State: **`remaining_vertices` is a set containing elements from 1 to n inclusive, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `path` is an empty list**
