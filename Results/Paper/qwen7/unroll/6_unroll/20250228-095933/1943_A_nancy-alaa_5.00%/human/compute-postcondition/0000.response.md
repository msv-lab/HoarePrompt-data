Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in Python to indicate that the value of the loop variable is not needed.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute based on the input from `input()`. Specifically, the loop will run as long as the input is a valid integer within the specified range.

3. **Adjust the initial state**: We need to ensure that the condition for the loop to execute is met. The condition is that the input should be a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^4\).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).

We need to ensure that the input to the loop is within this range. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should reflect that the input will be a valid integer within the specified range.

**Final State:**
- The input to `input()` must be a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^4\).

So, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **The input to `input()` must be a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^4\)**.
