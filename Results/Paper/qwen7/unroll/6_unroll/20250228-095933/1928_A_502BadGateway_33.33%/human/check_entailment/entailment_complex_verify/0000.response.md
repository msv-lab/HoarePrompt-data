### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the given program step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining if Bob can form a new rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. The key insight is that if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, it is possible to form a new rectangle. This is because:
- If \(b\) is even, we can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of dimensions \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\), and these can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
- Similarly, if \(a\) is even, we can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\), and these can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

The provided solution only checks if \(b\) is even, which is insufficient. We need to check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program iterates over each test case and calls the function `func_1(a, b)` to determine if a new rectangle can be formed.
- The function `func_1(a, b)` currently returns 'yes' if \(b\) is even and 'no' otherwise.

Given the example test cases:
- For \(2 \times 1\): The function returns 'no' because \(b = 1\) is odd.
- For \(2 \times 6\): The function returns 'no' because \(b = 6\) is even, but it fails to recognize that \(a = 2\) is also even, allowing the formation of a new rectangle.

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the function only checks if \(b\) is even, which is insufficient. The function needs to check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.

#### Corrected Function:
The corrected function should be:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

With this correction, the function will correctly identify cases where a new rectangle can be formed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate, and the provided program needs to be corrected to check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. The corrected function will ensure that the program handles all cases correctly.
