Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, but it fails to consider other scenarios where a rectangle can be divided into smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new distinct rectangle.

For example, consider the test case where \(a = 2\) and \(b = 6\). According to the problem description, Bob can cut the \(2 \times 6\) rectangle into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles, and then rearrange them to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle. However, the current implementation of `func_1` would incorrectly return "no" because \(b\) (which is 6) is even.

To fix this, the function should check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, as this condition allows for the possibility of cutting the rectangle into smaller rectangles that can be rearranged into a new distinct rectangle. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

This updated function correctly identifies cases where a new rectangle can be formed by checking if either dimension is even.
