Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and reassembled into a different rectangle. The key here is to consider all possible ways to cut the rectangle and see if the resulting pieces can form a new rectangle.

2. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1(a, b)` only checks if `b` is an even number. This is insufficient for solving the problem because:
   - A rectangle can be cut in multiple ways (not just along the shorter side).
   - Cutting along the longer side (if `b` is greater than `a`) might yield different results compared to cutting along the shorter side.
   - The function does not account for all possible cuts and rearrangements that could form a new rectangle.

3. **Examples**:
   - For the input \(2 \times 6\), the function returns 'yes' because \(6\) is even. However, as explained in the problem statement, \(2 \times 6\) can indeed be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and reassembled into a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.
   - For the input \(2 \times 1\), the function returns 'no' because \(1\) is odd. However, as explained, \(2 \times 1\) can be cut into two \(1 \times 1\) squares, which can be reassembled into a \(1 \times 2\) rectangle (which is considered the same as \(2 \times 1\)).

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, you need to check if there exists a way to cut the rectangle and reassemble it into a different rectangle. One approach is to check if either \(a\) or \(b\) can be expressed as a product of two integers in more than one way, allowing for the possibility of forming a new rectangle.

Given the above reasoning, the provided function does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
