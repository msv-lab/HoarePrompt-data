### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the problem and the program's logic to understand why.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The goal is to determine if a given rectangle \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a new distinct rectangle.
- A new rectangle can be formed if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, because:
  - If \(a\) is even, we can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of dimensions \(a/2 \times b\).
  - If \(b\) is even, we can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of dimensions \(a \times b/2\).

#### Program Analysis:
- The program iterates over the test cases and calls the function `func_1(a, b)` for each pair of dimensions.
- The function `func_1(a, b)` currently checks if \(b\) is even and returns "yes" if true, otherwise "no".
- This function does not consider the case where \(a\) is even, which is also a valid scenario for forming a new rectangle.

#### Corrected Function:
- The original assessment suggests modifying the function to check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even:
  ```python
  def func_1(a, b):
      return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
  ```
- This corrected function correctly handles all scenarios where a new rectangle can be formed.

#### Annotated Code Evaluation:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program before the function call and the logic within the function.
- The function `func_1` checks if \(b\) is even, but the original assessment is correct in pointing out that this does not cover all necessary cases.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided function does not correctly handle all cases, and the suggested correction is needed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases where a new rectangle can be formed. The function `func_1` should check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, as this is the correct condition for determining if a new rectangle can be formed.
