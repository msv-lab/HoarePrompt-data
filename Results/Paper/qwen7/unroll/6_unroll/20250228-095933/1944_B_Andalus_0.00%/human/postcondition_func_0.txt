The function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. For each test case, it outputs pairs of elements from the left sorted part of the list followed by single elements from both the left and right sorted parts, ensuring no more than `k` elements are printed in each line. Repeated elements in the left sorted part are handled such that the first occurrence is printed once, and subsequent occurrences are printed as pairs until `k` elements are printed or there are no more elements to print. The same process is applied to the right sorted part, but only single elements are printed from it. Elements are taken from the sorted parts in order until `k` elements are printed per line or all elements are processed.
