Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a` of length `2n`.
3. The array `a` is split into two halves: `lft` (first `n` elements) and `rgt` (last `n` elements).
4. The program sorts both halves.
5. It then processes the sorted halves to form the arrays `l` and `r`:
   - For the left half (`lft`), it collects repeated elements into `ldb` and unique elements into `sng`.
   - It prints elements from `ldb` and `sng` in a way that ensures no more than `k` elements are printed per line.
   - For the right half (`rgt`), it only considers repeated elements in `rdb` and prints them similarly.
6. The logic for printing elements ensures that the XOR of the elements in `l` matches the XOR of the elements in `r`.

However, there are some issues with the logic:
- The program does not ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` matches the XOR of the elements in `r`.
- The program does not handle the case where the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` might not be balanced properly by just printing elements from `ldb`, `sng`, and `rdb`.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` is balanced.
- Handle cases where the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` might not be balanced by adjusting the selection of elements.

Given these issues, the current implementation does not guarantee that the XOR of `l` and `r` will be equal.

Correctness: **False**
