Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the left and right halves of the input array separately and then constructing the required arrays `l` and `r` by selecting elements from these sorted halves. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Handling Repeated Elements**: The program tries to handle repeated elements by appending them to `ldb` and `sng` lists, but it does not correctly ensure that the XOR condition is met. Specifically, the program prints repeated elements in pairs from `ldb` and single elements from `sng`, which does not guarantee that the XOR values of `l` and `r` will be equal.

2. **XOR Calculation**: The program does not explicitly calculate the XOR of elements in `l` and `r` to ensure they match. Instead, it relies on the order and selection of elements, which is insufficient to guarantee the correct result.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints elements directly without ensuring that the final XOR values of `l` and `r` are equal. This approach is flawed because it does not account for the necessary balancing of XOR values across the selected elements.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
