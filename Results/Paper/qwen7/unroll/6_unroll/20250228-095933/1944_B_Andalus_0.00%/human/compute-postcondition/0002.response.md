Output State: The output will consist of pairs of elements from the left part of the sorted list followed by single elements, ensuring no more than `k` elements are printed per line. If there are repeated elements in the left part, only the first occurrence is considered. The process is then repeated for the right part of the sorted list. The output will be formatted such that each line contains at most `k` elements, with repeated elements from the left part appearing twice before moving on to single elements.
