Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. According to the problem description, the game is won by the player who makes the last valid move. The program incorrectly determines the winner based on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd. This logic is flawed because the game's outcome depends on the parity of the individual values of `a` and `b`, not their sum.

For example, consider the case where `a = 1` and `b = 4`. According to the problem description, the game should be analyzed based on the parity of `a` and `b` individually. Here, `a` is odd and `b` is even. The correct analysis would be as follows:

- Alice starts with `a = 1` and `b = 4`.
- Alice can either swap or not swap. If she swaps, `a` becomes 4 and `b` becomes 1. Now, `a` is even and `b` is odd.
- Bob then has the choice to either swap or not swap. If he swaps, `a` becomes 1 and `b` becomes 4. Now, `a` is odd and `b` is even.
- This process continues until one player cannot make a valid move.

The program incorrectly prints "Bob" for this case, which is wrong based on the optimal strategy. The correct output should be "Alice" for this case, as Alice can force Bob into a losing position by always swapping when `a` is odd and not swapping when `a` is even, ensuring that Bob is eventually left with an empty wallet.

Therefore, the program does not handle the game logic correctly and is thus incorrect.
