Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading pairs of integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Game Logic**: For each pair `(a, b)`, the program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd (`a + b & 1 != 0`), it prints "Alice".

3. **Optimal Play**: The logic correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`. This is because:
   - If the sum is even, Bob can always force the game into a state where the sum becomes odd after his move, ensuring he wins.
   - If the sum is odd, Alice can force the game into a state where the sum becomes even after her move, ensuring she wins.

4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the result for each test case as specified in the problem statement.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the program accurately reflects the optimal strategy for both players and produces the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
