The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` followed by `t` pairs of positive integers `a` and `b`. For each pair, it checks if their sum is even or odd and prints 'Bob' if the sum is even, otherwise it prints 'Alice'. After processing all test cases, it outputs a total of `t` lines, each containing either 'Bob' or 'Alice'.
