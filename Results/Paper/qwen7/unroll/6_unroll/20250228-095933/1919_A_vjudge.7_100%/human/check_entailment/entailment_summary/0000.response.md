Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic of the game as described. According to the problem statement, the winner is determined based on whether the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd after the game's rules are applied. However, the program simply checks if the initial sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and makes a decision based on that. This is incorrect because the game involves turns where players can swap wallets and remove a coin, which affects the parity of the sum.

The correct approach should simulate the game's turns and check the final state of the coins in both wallets to determine the winner. The given program does not simulate these turns but instead relies on the initial sum, which is insufficient for determining the winner under optimal play.

Correctness: **False**
