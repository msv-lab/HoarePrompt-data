Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5; additionally, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer; `flag` is set to True.**

The code initializes the variable `flag` to `True`. Since `t`, `n`, and `arr` are not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged.
