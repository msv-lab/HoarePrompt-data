Output State: **`val` is equal to `arr[n-1]`, `cnt` is 0, `flag` is True, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive equal elements found during the loop execution, and `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Since `cnt` is currently 0, `ans` will be updated to 0 if `ans` was greater than 0, or remain unchanged if `ans` was 0 or less. The other variables (`val`, `cnt`, `flag`, and `ans`) retain their previous states.
