### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
   - A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates through the array to check if it is already uniform (all elements are the same).
   - If the array is uniform, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove by counting the longest sequence of consecutive equal elements and using this to determine the minimum removals needed.

3. **Key Points in the Annotated Code**:
   - The program checks if the array is uniform by setting a flag and breaking out of the loop if any two consecutive elements are different.
   - If the array is uniform, it prints `-1`.
   - If the array is not uniform, it counts the longest sequence of consecutive equal elements and uses this to determine the minimum number of removals needed.

4. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The program correctly identifies if the array is uniform and prints `-1` if it is.
   - However, the logic for determining the minimum number of removals is flawed. The program only considers the longest sequence of consecutive equal elements and does not account for the possibility of removing elements in a way that breaks the beauty condition without necessarily removing the maximum number of elements.

5. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
     ```
     4
     3
     2 2 2
     5
     1 2 1 2 1
     1
     1
     7
     3 3 3 5 3 3 3
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     -1
     1
     -1
     3
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     -1
     -1
     -1
     3
     ```
   - The program fails to correctly identify the minimum number of removals for the second and third test cases.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the requirement to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only considers the longest sequence of consecutive equal elements, which is not always the optimal solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not accurately determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful in all cases.
