### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \(n\) and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If so, it prints `-1` because no removals are needed.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of removals required to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Key Logic**:
   - The code iterates through the array to find the longest subsequence where elements are the same (`val`).
   - It counts the length of this subsequence (`cnt`).
   - The minimum number of removals required to break the beauty of the array is calculated as the minimum count of any such subsequence.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies whether the array is already uniform.
   - However, the logic for calculating the minimum number of removals is flawed. The code only considers the longest subsequence of identical elements and does not account for the possibility that removing elements from different subsequences might result in fewer total removals.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The code would identify the longest subsequence as `[1, 2, 1]` and calculate the removals as 2, which is incorrect. The optimal solution would be to remove the middle element (index 2), making the array non-beautiful with only 1 removal.

5. **Detailed Example**:
   - Consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`:
     - The code would identify the longest subsequence as `[1, 2, 1]` and calculate the removals as 2.
     - However, the optimal solution is to remove the middle element (index 2), making the array non-beautiful with only 1 removal.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The code does not handle all possible scenarios for breaking the beauty of the array. It only considers the longest subsequence, which may not always yield the minimum number of removals.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not account for all possible ways to break the beauty of the array, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
