Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be modified by replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
2. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Specifically:
   - The `func_1` function does not properly check if the array is beautiful or not.
   - The logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed.
3. The code initializes `flag` to `True` and sets it to `False` if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements that are not equal. However, this does not correctly determine if the array is beautiful.
4. The code then attempts to find the minimum count of consecutive equal elements, which is not relevant to solving the problem.
5. The final output is incorrect because it always prints `-1` or `0`, regardless of the actual requirements of the problem.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
