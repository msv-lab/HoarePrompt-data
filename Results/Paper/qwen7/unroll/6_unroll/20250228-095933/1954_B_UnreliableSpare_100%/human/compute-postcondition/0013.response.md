Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` is equal to `arr[n-1]`
- `cnt` is 0
- `flag` is True
- `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive equal elements found during the loop execution, but it is initially set to the minimum between its current value (which is not specified but assumed to be some initial value) and `cnt` (which is 0).

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
