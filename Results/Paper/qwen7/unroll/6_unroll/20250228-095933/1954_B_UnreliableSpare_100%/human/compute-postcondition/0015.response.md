Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` is equal to `arr[n-1]`, where `arr` is a list and `n` is the length of the list `arr`.
- `cnt` is 0, meaning it starts with a count of 0.
- `flag` is False, which is irrelevant to the calculation of `ans`.
- `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive equal elements found during the loop execution, and it is updated to the minimum between its current value and `cnt`.

Given that `cnt` starts at 0 and there is no information about any loop or further updates to `cnt` or `ans`, we can conclude that `ans` remains 0 after the loop execution.

Output: **0**
