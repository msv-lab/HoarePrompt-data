Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5; additionally, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer; `flag` is set to False if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in `arr` that are not equal, otherwise `flag` is set to True; `ans` is set to Decimal('Infinity').**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')`. This means that `ans` now holds the value `Decimal('Infinity')`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
