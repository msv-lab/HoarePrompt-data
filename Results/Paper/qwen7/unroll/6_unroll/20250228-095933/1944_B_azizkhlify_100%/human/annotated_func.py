#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The list a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.

    #State: Output State: The output will consist of multiple lines, each representing the result of one test case. For each test case, it will first print pairs of numbers that appear exactly twice in the list `a` and match certain conditions, followed by any remaining single occurrences of numbers that also meet specific criteria. The exact numbers printed will depend on the input values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a`. After printing these pairs and singles, it may print additional pairs based on the remaining unmatched elements in the second half of the list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, along with two integers n and k. For each test case, it prints pairs of numbers that appear exactly twice and meet certain conditions, followed by any remaining single occurrences of numbers that also meet specific criteria. If there are still unmatched elements in the second half of the list, it prints additional pairs based on these remaining elements. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.
