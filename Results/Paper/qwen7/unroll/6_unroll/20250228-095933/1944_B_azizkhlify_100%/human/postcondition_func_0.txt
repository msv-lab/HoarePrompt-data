The function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, along with two integers n and k. For each test case, it prints pairs of numbers that appear exactly twice and meet certain conditions, followed by any remaining single occurrences of numbers that also meet specific criteria. If there are still unmatched elements in the second half of the list, it prints additional pairs based on these remaining elements. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.
