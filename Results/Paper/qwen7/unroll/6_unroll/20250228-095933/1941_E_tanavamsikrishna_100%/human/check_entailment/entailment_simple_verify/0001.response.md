### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: The function starts by setting the first element of the row to 1 (base cost for the first support). Then, it increments the next `d-1` elements by 2, making them 3.
2. **Min-Heap Initialization**: A min-heap is created with the first `d` elements of the row.
3. **Heap Operations**: For each subsequent element in the row (starting from index `d`), the function pops the smallest element from the heap whose index is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. This ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most `d`.
4. **Update Row Costs**: The current element is updated by adding the popped element's value plus one. Both the updated value and the original value are pushed back into the heap.
5. **Return Last Element**: The function returns the cost of the last element in the row, which represents the total cost for the row.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of `func_1`:
- The heap operations do not correctly ensure that the distance between supports is exactly `d`. Instead, they only ensure that the distance is at most `d`.
- The initial setup of the heap and the subsequent updates do not guarantee that the minimum cost for placing supports is achieved correctly.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and the depths of each row.
2. **Calculating Costs**: It calls `func_1` for each row and stores the results in the `costs` list.
3. **Finding Minimum Total Cost**: It iterates through the `costs` list to find the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.
4. **Printing Result**: It prints the minimum total cost.

The main issue here is that `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for placing supports in a row. The logic in `func_1` does not ensure that the distance between supports is exactly `d`, which is a critical requirement.

#### Correctness of the Solution:
Given the flaws in `func_1`, the overall solution is incorrect. The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum cost for placing supports in a row, leading to an incorrect total cost when calculating the minimum cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was inaccurate because the core function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to place supports with the exact distance constraint `d`.
