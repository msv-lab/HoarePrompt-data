Output State: **`costs` is a list of `n` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the integers inputted separated by spaces; `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells for each row. The first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `costs` where each element is the result of calling `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are updated to the values of the integers inputted, and `rows` remains unchanged except for being updated with the new values from the input.
