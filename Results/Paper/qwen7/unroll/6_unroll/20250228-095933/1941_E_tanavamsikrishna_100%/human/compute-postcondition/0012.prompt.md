You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of integers representing the depths of the river cells in a single row, and d is a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports.
def func_1(row, d):
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2
        
    #State: Output State: `row` is a list of integers where the first element is 1, and each subsequent element from index 1 to `d-1` is set to 3. The rest of the elements in the list remain unchanged.
    min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
            pass
        
        row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
        
        heappush(min_heap, e)
        
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
        
    #State: Output State: `row` is a list of integers where the first element is 2, and each subsequent element from index 1 to `len(row)-1` is set to 4; `min_heap` is an empty list.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over the elements of `row` starting from index `d`. For each iteration, it pops the smallest element from `min_heap` whose index is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`, then updates the current element in `row` by adding the popped element's value plus one, and pushes both the updated value and the original value back into `min_heap`. This process continues until `min_heap` is empty, resulting in an empty `min_heap` and each element in `row` being incremented by 2 (initially 1 + 1 for the first element and 3 + 1 for the rest).
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns 6
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `row`, a list of integers representing the depths of the river cells in a single row, and `d`, a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports. It returns 6.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns 6


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
