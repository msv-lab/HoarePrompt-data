### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `row` representing the depths of the river cells in a single row and an integer `d` representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports.
   - It initializes the first element of `row` to 1 and sets the next `d-1` elements to 3.
   - It then uses a min-heap to efficiently find the smallest element within the last `d` elements of the current row, ensuring that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - The function updates the row by incrementing each element by the value of the smallest element found in the last `d` elements plus one, and maintains a min-heap to keep track of these values.
   - Finally, it returns the last element of the modified row, which represents the total cost of installing supports for that row.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the dimensions of the river (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`) and the depths of the river cells for each row.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to calculate the cost of installing supports for that row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible sequence of `k` consecutive rows by summing the costs of the supports for those rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all such sequences.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It uses `func_1` to compute the cost for each row and then aggregates these costs to find the minimum total cost for any sequence of `k` consecutive rows.
   - The logic and implementation in both functions appear to align with the problem statement and constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It processes each test case appropriately and computes the minimum total cost of installing supports for any sequence of `k` consecutive rows.

### Correctness:
