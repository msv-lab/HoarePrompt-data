### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to build \( k \) bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the start and end of the row.
   - The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than \( d \).
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes a single row of the river grid.
   - It initializes the first element of the row to 2.
   - It then uses a min-heap to ensure that the cost of placing supports is minimized within a sliding window of size \( d+2 \).
   - The function returns the total cost of installing supports for the entire row.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function handles the entire problem.
   - It reads the dimensions \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and \( d \) from the input.
   - It reads the river grid into a list of rows.
   - For each row, it calls `func_1` to get the cost of installing supports.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building \( k \) consecutive bridges by summing the costs of \( k \) consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of \( k \) consecutive rows.

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimal cost for a single row by ensuring that the distance between supports is no more than \( d \).
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly applies `func_1` to each row and then finds the minimum cost for building \( k \) consecutive bridges.

Given the provided execution summaries and the logical correctness of both functions, the program should work as intended.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
