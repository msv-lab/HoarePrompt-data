To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

### Function `func_1` Analysis
1. **Initialization**: The function starts by setting the first element of the row to 1.
2. **Preprocessing for the first `d` elements**: It adds 2 to each of the first `d` elements.
3. **Heap Initialization**: A min-heap is initialized with the first `d` elements of the row.
4. **Main Loop**: For each subsequent element in the row (starting from index `d`), it removes elements from the heap that are out of the current window of size `d`, updates the current element with the minimum value from the heap plus 1, and then pushes the updated value back into the heap.

### Function `func_2` Analysis
1. **Reading Input**: Reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` and the rows of the grid.
2. **Cost Calculation for Each Row**: Uses `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost for placing supports in each row.
3. **Total Cost Calculation**: Computes the minimum total cost for placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing up the costs of the selected rows and finding the minimum sum.

### Correctness Check
1. **Heap Usage**: The use of a min-heap is appropriate for maintaining the minimum cost within the sliding window of size `d`.
2. **Cost Calculation**: The logic for updating the cost of placing supports in each row seems correct.
3. **Sliding Window Sum**: The logic for calculating the minimum total cost for placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows also appears correct.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the provided solution seems to correctly implement the required functionality.

### Conclusion
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.

**Correctness: True**
