Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases, particularly for values of `n` between 27 and 52. Let's break down the issues and provide the correct solution.

#### Issues in the Provided Solution:
1. **Handling `n` between 27 and 52**: 
   - The code tries to handle these cases with `word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`, which is incorrect.
   - For example, for `n = 30`, it should result in "acv" but the current logic will produce "azv".

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The special handling for `n = 27` (`word = 'aay'`) is correct.
   - However, the general logic for other cases needs to be adjusted.

#### Correct Solution:
To find the lexicographically smallest word, we need to ensure that we always use the smallest possible letters while ensuring the sum matches `n`.

Hereâ€™s the corrected implementation:

```python
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        
        # Determine the first character
        if n >= 27:
            first_char_index = n // 26
            if first_char_index > 2:
                first_char_index = 2
            word += alphabet[first_char_index - 1]
            n -= 26 * first_char_index
        
        # Determine the second character
        if n >= 26:
            second_char_index = n // 26
            if second_char_index > 2:
                second_char_index = 2
            word += alphabet[second_char_index - 1]
            n -= 26 * second_char_index
        
        # Determine the third character
        if n > 0:
            word += alphabet[n - 1]
        
        print(word)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **First Character**:
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to 27, the first character can be determined by dividing `n` by 26.
   - We limit the first character to 'a', 'b', or 'c' to ensure the word remains lexicographically smallest.
   - Subtract the contribution of the first character from `n`.

2. **Second Character**:
   - Similarly, the second character is determined by dividing the remaining value of `n` by 26.
   - Again, we limit the second character to 'a', 'b', or 'c'.

3. **Third Character**:
   - The third character is simply the remainder after accounting for the first two characters.

This approach ensures that the word is always the lexicographically smallest possible word that sums up to `n`.
