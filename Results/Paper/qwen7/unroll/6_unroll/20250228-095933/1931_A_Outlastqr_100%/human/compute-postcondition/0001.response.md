Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 78\).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as the value of `i` is less than `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 (the default starting value for the `range` function), the loop will start with `i = 0`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Given the constraints, `int(input())` should be within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 100\).

5. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `i` starts at 0.
   - `int(input())` must be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 100\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer within the range 1 to 100**.
