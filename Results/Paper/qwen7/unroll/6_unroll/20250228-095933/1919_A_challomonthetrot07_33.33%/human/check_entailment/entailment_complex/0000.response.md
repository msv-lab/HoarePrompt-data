Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the initial number of coins in their wallets (`a` and `b`). Both players take turns, and the player who cannot make a valid move loses.
2. The provided solution checks several conditions to determine the winner:
   - If `a == b`, Bob wins.
   - If `a == 1`, Alice wins.
   - If `b == 1`, Bob wins.
   - If `a % 2 == 1`, Bob wins.
   - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`, Alice wins.
   - If `a > b`, Bob wins.
   - Otherwise, Alice wins.
3. Let's verify these conditions against the game rules:
   - If `a == b`, the game is symmetric, and the player whose turn it is will lose because they will always face the same situation after swapping. Thus, Bob wins.
   - If `a == 1`, Alice cannot make a move since she would remove the last coin and then be unable to swap or make another move. Thus, Alice loses, and Bob wins.
   - If `b == 1`, Bob is in the same situation as above but from Bob's perspective. Thus, Bob wins.
   - If `a % 2 == 1`, Alice will always end up with an odd number of coins after her turn, forcing Bob to face an even number of coins. This means Bob can always mirror Alice's moves until Alice is forced to lose. Thus, Bob wins.
   - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by always leaving Bob with an odd number of coins. Thus, Alice wins.
   - If `a > b`, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he will eventually win. Thus, Bob wins.
   - Otherwise, Alice wins because she can always force Bob into a losing position by maintaining a higher or equal number of coins and ensuring she never faces an unfavorable situation.

Given these conditions align with the optimal strategy for both players, the provided solution correctly determines the winner based on the game rules.

Correctness: **True**
