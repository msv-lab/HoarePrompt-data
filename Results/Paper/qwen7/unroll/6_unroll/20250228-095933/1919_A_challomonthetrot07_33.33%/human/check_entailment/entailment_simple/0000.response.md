### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code against the problem statement and the given examples.

1. **Initial Conditions and Game Rules**:
   - Both players start with non-zero coins.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them.
   - A player loses if they cannot make a valid move after removing one coin from their wallet.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If both players have the same number of coins (`a == b`), Bob wins because Alice will eventually be forced to swap wallets and end up with zero coins.
   - If Alice has exactly 1 coin (`a == 1`), she wins because she can immediately lose by swapping wallets and leaving Bob with 1 coin, which he can then remove to win.
   - If Bob has exactly 1 coin (`b == 1`), Alice wins because she can swap wallets and leave Bob with no coins to remove.
   - If `a` is odd, Bob wins because Alice will eventually be forced to swap wallets and end up with 0 coins.
   - If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice wins because Bob will eventually be forced to swap wallets and end up with 0 coins.
   - If `a > b`, Bob wins because Alice will eventually be forced to swap wallets and end up with 0 coins.
   - Otherwise, Alice wins.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly handles the conditions mentioned above.
   - It checks all the key conditions and prints the appropriate winner based on those conditions.

4. **Examples Verification**:
   - The provided examples match the logic implemented in the code. For instance:
     - When `a = 1` and `b = 1`, Bob wins.
     - When `a = 1` and `b = 4`, Alice wins.
     - When `a = 5` and `b = 3`, Bob wins.
     - When `a = 4` and `b = 5`, Alice wins.
     - When `a = 11` and `b = 9`, Bob wins.
     - And so on...

Given that the code correctly implements the logic and matches the provided examples, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
