Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', depending on the last time entered in the loop, `n` is the number of times the loop has executed. After executing all iterations of the loop, `t` remains unchanged, `day` is set to 'AM' or 'PM' based on the last time entered (in the format `h:m`), and `n` is the total number of times the loop has run.
