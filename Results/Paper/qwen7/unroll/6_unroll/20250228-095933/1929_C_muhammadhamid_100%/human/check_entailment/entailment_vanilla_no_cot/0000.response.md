Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `s`:**
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 1, which represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can keep winning without violating the rules.
   - The loop iterates `x` times, where `x` is the maximum number of consecutive losses allowed. For each iteration, `s` is updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1`. This calculation is flawed because it doesn't account for the actual betting strategy needed to ensure Sasha can always win enough coins to exceed any given target `n`.

2. **Strategy for Winning:**
   - The problem requires Sasha to devise a betting strategy that ensures he can always win enough coins to reach any target `n`, given the constraints on `k`, `x`, and `a`.
   - The provided solution does not correctly simulate or calculate the necessary betting amounts to achieve this goal.

3. **Output Logic:**
   - The program prints 'Yes' if `a` (initial coins) is greater than or equal to `s`, which is an incorrect condition. The logic should check if Sasha can always win enough coins to reach any target `n` based on the given rules.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the betting strategy and ensure that Sasha can always win enough coins to reach any target `n`. A more appropriate approach would involve:

1. **Simulating the Betting Strategy:**
   - Start with the initial number of coins `a`.
   - Use a dynamic programming or recursive approach to simulate the betting process and ensure Sasha can always win enough coins to reach any target `n`.

2. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - For each test case, check if Sasha can always win enough coins to reach any target `n` based on the given rules.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_earn_any_number_of_coins(k, x, a):
    # If k is 2, Sasha can always win enough coins to reach any target n
    if k == 2:
        return True
    # If x is 1, Sasha can always win enough coins to reach any target n
    if x == 1:
        return True
    # If Sasha's initial coins are enough to cover the worst-case scenario
    if a >= (k ** x - 1) // (k - 1):
        return True
    return False

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        if can_earn_any_number_of_coins(k, x, a):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected program checks the feasibility of Sasha achieving any number of coins based on the given rules and constraints.
