Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` which represent the multiplier for winning, the maximum number of consecutive losses, and the initial number of coins respectively.

2. **Calculation of `s`:**
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 1.
   - A loop runs from `0` to `x-1` (inclusive), updating `s` in each iteration.
   - Inside the loop, `s` is updated using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.

3. **Checking Condition:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s`.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Reasoning

#### Formula Explanation
- The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is used to simulate the growth of Sasha's coins based on the given rules.
- Let's break down what this formula does:
  - `s // (k - 1)` calculates how much Sasha would gain if he wins after losing `x-1` times consecutively.
  - Adding `1` accounts for the initial bet placed after a loss.
  - This process is repeated for `x` iterations to simulate the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times consecutively and then starts winning.

#### Correctness Check

1. **Initial Test Case:**
   - For the first test case (`2 1 7`):
     - `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 7`
     - After one loss, `s` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
     - After winning, `s` becomes `2 + 2 = 4`.
     - Since `7 >= 4`, the program outputs "Yes", which is correct.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - For the second test case (`2 1 1`):
     - `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 1`
     - After one loss, `s` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
     - Since `1 < 2`, the program outputs "No", which is correct.
   - For the third test case (`2 3 15`):
     - `k = 2`, `x = 3`, `a = 15`
     - After three losses, `s` becomes `1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8`.
     - After winning, `s` becomes `8 + 8 = 16`.
     - Since `15 >= 16 - 1`, the program outputs "Yes", which is correct.

3. **General Validation:**
   - The logic in the program correctly simulates the worst-case scenario and checks if the initial amount of coins `a` can cover the calculated `s` value.
   - The formula ensures that Sasha can recover from the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times consecutively and then starting to win.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins given the constraints.

**Correctness: True**
