The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\), an array \(a\) of \(n\) integers, and a string \(t\) of length \(n\) containing only 'L' and 'R'. It then calculates a sequence of integers \(y\) based on the values in \(a\) and the direction indicated by \(t\). Specifically, it computes the product of selected elements from \(a\) modulo \(m\), following the directions in \(t\) from right to left, storing the results in \(y\). Finally, it prints the sequence \(y\).
