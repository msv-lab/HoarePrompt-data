State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ii` is 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop is controlled by the variable `ii`, which is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
- The condition for the loop to execute is based on the input value of `t`. Specifically, the loop will run as long as `ii < t`.
- Since `t` is given as a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), and `ii` starts at 0, the loop will execute `t` times.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `ii` to 0 and confirm that `t` is within the specified range.
