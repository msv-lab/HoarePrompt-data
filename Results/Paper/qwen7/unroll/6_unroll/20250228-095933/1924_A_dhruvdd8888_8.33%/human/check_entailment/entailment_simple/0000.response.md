Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` correctly reads the input values for `n`, `k`, and `m`, and then reads the string `s`. It also initializes necessary variables like `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps`.

2. **Tracking Subsequences**: The function iterates through the string `s` and checks if each character is in `us`. If it is, it adds the character to `win`. When `win` contains all `k` characters, it appends the current character to `ans` and clears `win`. This logic ensures that `ans` contains subsequences of length `k` found in `s`.

3. **Output Logic**: 
   - If `ps` (the count of times `ans` was appended) is greater than or equal to `n`, it means all possible subsequences of length `n` can be formed, so it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and generates a string that cannot be formed as a subsequence of `s`. The generated string is constructed by taking the first character from `us` that is not in `win` and appending it to `ans`, followed by `a` repeated `(n - len(ans) - 1)` times.

4. **Edge Cases and Guarantees**: The solution handles all edge cases as per the problem statement. It correctly identifies whether all possible subsequences of length `n` can be formed and provides a counterexample if they cannot.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
