Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, the string `s` is now the input string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `ps` is 0.**

The code initializes `ps` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
