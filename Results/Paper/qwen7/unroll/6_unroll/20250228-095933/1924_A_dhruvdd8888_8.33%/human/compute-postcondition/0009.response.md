Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, the string `s` is now the input string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is a set initially empty but potentially contains some of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets depending on the content of `s`, `ans` is a list of characters where each character is added when `win` contains exactly `k` elements, `ps` is an integer representing the number of times `ans` was appended, which is also the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` elements, and `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
