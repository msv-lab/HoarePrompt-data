Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in us:`. This means the loop variable `i` is taken from the set `us`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `us`**: 
   - `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `i` will take each element from this set one by one during the loop iterations.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `us`. Once `us` is empty, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is a variable that takes values from `us`, we need to ensure that `us` is not empty at the start of the loop. If `us` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - We do not need to adjust the value of `i` because it will be assigned the first element of `us` at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `us` to ensure it is not empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must not be empty**
