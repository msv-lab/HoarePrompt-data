Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Calculation of Expected Value**: The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The formula used in the program does not match the problem's requirements.

2. **Friendship Value Update**: The program assumes that the friendship value of a chosen pair increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions, but it does not properly account for the probability of choosing the same pair again.

3. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The modular inverse `c` is calculated using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`, which is incorrect because `n * (n - 1) // 1` simplifies to `n * (n - 1)`, and the modular inverse of this product modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is not relevant to the problem.

4. **Summation Logic**: The summation logic inside the loop is incorrect. The program adds the initial friendship values directly without considering the probability and expected value calculation.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to use the following approach:

1. Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion.
2. Use the fact that the probability of choosing any pair in each excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
3. For each pair, calculate the expected increase in friendship value over \(k\) excursions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        # Calculate the total number of pairs
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        
        # Initialize the sum of friendship values
        total_friendship_value = 0
        
        # Process each friendship
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            total_friendship_value += f
        
        # Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values
        expected_value = (total_friendship_value * k + (k * (k - 1) // 2) * (total_pairs - m)) % MOD
        
        print(expected_value)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \(k\) excursions and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
