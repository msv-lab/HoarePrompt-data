### Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect because the term `c * i * c * m` in the expected value calculation is indeed incorrect. Let's break down the problem and the correct approach:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - For each excursion, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

2. **Correct Approach:**
   - For each pair of friends, the probability of choosing them in any excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - Since there are \(m\) pairs of friends, the expected increase in friendship value for each pair over \(k\) excursions is \(\frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - Therefore, the expected sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen over \(k\) excursions is the sum of the friendship values of all pairs of friends multiplied by \(\frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

3. **Correct Formula:**
   - The correct formula should be:
     \[
     \text{Expected Sum} = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \right) \times \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     \text{Expected Sum} = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \right) \times \frac{2k}{n(n-1)}
     \]

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Since we need the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\), we need to ensure all calculations are performed under this modulus.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The program should initialize `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - Then, the expected sum should be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Expected Sum} = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \right) \times \frac{2k \cdot c}{n(n-1)}
     \]
   - Finally, the result should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the above analysis, the original program's implementation is incorrect because it does not follow the correct formula for the expected sum of friendship values.

### Final Evaluation:

**Final: False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem due to the incorrect formula used in the expected value calculation.
