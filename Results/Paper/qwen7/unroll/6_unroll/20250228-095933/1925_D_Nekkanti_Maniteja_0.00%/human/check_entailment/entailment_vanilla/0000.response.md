Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\), which is used as the modulus.
   - `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - This is done using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

3. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - A variable `a` is initialized to 0.
   - For each of the `m` pairs of friends, the program reads `u`, `v`, and `f`.
   - It adds the friendship value `f` to `a`.

4. **Calculating Expected Sum:**
   - The program initializes `s` to 0.
   - For each of the `k` excursions, it updates `s` as follows:
     - `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`
   - Finally, it prints `s % M`.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
   - The calculation of `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is correct. This ensures that when we multiply by `c`, we effectively divide by \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The sum `a` of friendship values is correctly calculated.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` seems to be an attempt to calculate the expected sum of friendship values.
   - However, the term `c * i * c * m` does not seem to align with the problem statement. The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen for the excursions. The term `c * i * c * m` does not directly contribute to this calculation.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The output is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Specifically, the term `c * i * c * m` in the expected value calculation is incorrect. The correct approach would involve calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion and summing these values.

### Correctness:

**False**
