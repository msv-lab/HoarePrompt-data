### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to understand why the original assessment is accurate.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes `M` as \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - It reads `m` pairs of friends and their friendship values.
   - It sums up all the friendship values into `a`.

3. **Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The program iterates `k` times and updates `s` using the formula:
     \[
     s = s + c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a
     \]
   - This formula is incorrect because it does not account for the probability of selecting each pair and the expected increase in friendship values over the k excursions.

4. **Probability and Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The correct approach would involve calculating the probability of selecting each pair and the expected increase in friendship values.
   - For each pair of friends, the probability of selecting them in any given excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - The expected increase in friendship value for a pair over k excursions is \(k \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - The overall expected value for all pairs is the sum of the expected increases for each pair.

5. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The program uses modular arithmetic correctly by taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach involves calculating the expected value for each pair and summing these values over all k excursions.
- The expected value for a pair of friends with friendship value \(f\) is \(k \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot f\).
- The total expected value is the sum of these expected values for all pairs of friends.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic. It incorrectly adds a constant value `c * a` for each excursion, which does not reflect the actual expected value calculation.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

**Final: False**
