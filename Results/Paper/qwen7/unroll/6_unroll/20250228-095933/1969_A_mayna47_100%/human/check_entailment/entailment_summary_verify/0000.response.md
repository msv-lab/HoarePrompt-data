### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the example cases.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1()` takes a list `p` as input, constructs a list `v` based on `p`, and checks if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[i]] == i`.
- If such an index is found, it means there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, and the function prints `2` and returns.
- If no such index is found, the function prints `3`.

#### Problem Description and Example Cases:
- Monocarp needs to invite at least 2 friends to the party.
- If the i-th friend and the p_i-th friend both receive invitations, the i-th friend will come to the party.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

#### Test Case Analysis:
1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     5
     3 1 2 5 4
     ```
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Friends 4 and 5 are each other's best friends, so inviting both of them ensures that both come to the party. The program correctly identifies this and prints `2`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     4
     2 3 4 1
     ```
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Explanation: No pair of friends are each other's best friends. Inviting friends 1, 2, and 3 ensures that friends 1 and 2 come to the party. The program correctly identifies this and prints `3`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     2
     2 1
     ```
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Friends 1 and 2 are each other's best friends, so inviting both of them ensures that both come to the party. The program correctly identifies this and prints `2`.

4. **Test Case with No Pairs:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     4
     1 2 3 4
     ```
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Explanation: No pair of friends are each other's best friends. Inviting all four friends is necessary to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. However, the program incorrectly prints `2` because it does not handle this case correctly.

#### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly handles cases where there are pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2`.
- However, the program incorrectly handles cases where no such pairs exist and prints `2` instead of the correct number of invitations required (which would be `n` in such cases).

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, specifically failing to handle cases where no pair of friends are each other's best friends.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
