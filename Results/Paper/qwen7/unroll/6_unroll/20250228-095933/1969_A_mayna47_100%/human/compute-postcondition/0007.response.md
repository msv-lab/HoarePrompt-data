Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes values within a predefined range for `t` (1 to 5000) and for each test case, `n` (2 to 50), and a list `p` of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n`, exclusive, and all integers in `p` are distinct. It returns a result based on these inputs.**
