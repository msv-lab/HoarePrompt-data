The function processes a list `p` of integers for each test case, where `n` (the length of the list) ranges from 2 to 50, and each integer in the list is unique and between 1 and `n`, exclusive. It constructs a list `v` based on the input and checks if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[i]] == i`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and returns immediately. Otherwise, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value explicitly but prints either `2` or `3` based on the condition check.
