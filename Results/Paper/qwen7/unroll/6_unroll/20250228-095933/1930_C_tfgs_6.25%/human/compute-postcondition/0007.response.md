Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, and `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5. A Counter object is created from the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `a` in descending order. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the Counter object created from `a` is still valid.
