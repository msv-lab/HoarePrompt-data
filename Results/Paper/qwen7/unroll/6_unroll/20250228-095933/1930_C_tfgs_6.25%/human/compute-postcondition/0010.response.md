Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(a)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (the starting value for the `range` function).
   - `len(a)` is the length of the list `a`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = len(a) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` should be set to 0.
   - `len(a)` should be the length of the list `a`, which is a known quantity based on the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order.
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `cnt` is \(n - \text{len}(a)\).
- `ans` is an empty list.

We only need to adjust the states of `i` and `len(a)`.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 0, `len(a)` is the length of the list `a`**
