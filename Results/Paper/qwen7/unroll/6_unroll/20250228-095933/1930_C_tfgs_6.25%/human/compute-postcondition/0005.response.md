Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` (for 0 ≤ i < n) is increased by `i + 1`, and `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5; a Counter object is created from the list `a`.**

The code `counter = Counter(a)` creates a `Counter` object from the list `a`. This `Counter` object keeps track of the counts of elements in the list `a`. However, the values of `t` and `n`, and the structure of the list `a` itself, remain unchanged.
