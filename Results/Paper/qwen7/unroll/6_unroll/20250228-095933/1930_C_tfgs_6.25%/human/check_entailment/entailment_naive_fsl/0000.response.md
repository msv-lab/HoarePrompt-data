Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where multiple elements in the array `a` are the same. According to the problem description, the set `S` should only contain unique elements, and inserting an element that is already present in `S` will not change the elements of the set. However, the program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element and then tries to ensure that no duplicates are added to the final sorted list `b`. This approach does not correctly simulate the behavior of a set, where duplicate values are ignored during insertion.

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
3
2
2 1
5
1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
3
6 4 8
```

Expected Output:
```
3 2 
1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
11 7 6 
```

However, the program's output for the first test case is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `i = 2` in the first operation, leading to `S = {3}` instead of `S = {2, 3}`. This results in the output `[3]` instead of `[3, 2]`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that each element is inserted into `S` only once, regardless of its count in the original array. The current implementation does not achieve this, as it attempts to adjust the counts of elements in the `Counter` object, which is unnecessary and incorrect for simulating a set.
