You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It then processes this data to handle multiple test cases.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of sticks `n` and the array `a` representing the exponents.
   - It initializes an array `v` to count occurrences of each exponent value.

3. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It iterates through the array `a` and counts how many times each exponent appears in `v`.

4. **Calculating Number of Ways to Form a Triangle:**
   - To form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.
   - Given that the lengths are powers of 2, we need to check combinations of three sticks where the sum of the smaller two lengths is greater than the largest length.

5. **Combination Counting:**
   - The program uses combinatorial counting to find the number of valid triplets:
     - If there are at least 2 sticks with the same length, it counts pairs and adds to the result.
     - If there are at least 3 sticks with the same length, it counts triplets and adds to the result.
   - It also keeps track of the cumulative count of sticks seen so far (`cnt`).

6. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

### Detailed Check:

- **Handling Duplicates:**
  - The program correctly handles cases where multiple sticks have the same length by counting pairs and triplets appropriately.

- **Triangle Inequality:**
  - Since the lengths are powers of 2, the program implicitly checks the triangle inequality because the sum of any two powers of 2 will always be greater than the third power of 2 if they are distinct.

- **Cumulative Count:**
  - The cumulative count `cnt` helps in correctly calculating the number of valid pairs and triplets without double-counting.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases like having no valid triangles (e.g., all sticks have different lengths and cannot form a triangle).

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. It handles all constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
