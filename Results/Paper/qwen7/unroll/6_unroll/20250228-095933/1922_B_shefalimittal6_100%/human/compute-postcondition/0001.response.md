Output State: **`input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and the list `a` contains n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of all n values over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5; data is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The values of `input`, `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged from the initial state. The new variable `data` is created and assigned the list of strings resulting from the split operation.
