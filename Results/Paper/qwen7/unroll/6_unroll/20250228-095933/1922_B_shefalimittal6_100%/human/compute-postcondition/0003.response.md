Output State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[idx])` assigns the value of `data[idx]` (which is the first element of the list `data` since `idx` is 0) converted to an integer to the variable `t`. After this assignment, `idx` is incremented by 1 (though this increment is not explicitly shown in the given code snippet, it is implied by the context of reading input sequentially), and the value of `t` is now the integer value of the first element in the list `data`. All other variables remain unchanged.
