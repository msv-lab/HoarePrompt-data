State: **`idx` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` which is used as the range parameter for the loop.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0), because the `range(t)` function will not generate any values if `t` is less than or equal to 0.
3. The variables `idx` and `results` are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.
4. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` must be greater than 0, while keeping `idx` as 2 and `results` as an empty list.
