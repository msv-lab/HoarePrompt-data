You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: what is printed (where the printed content is the elements of the `results` list, each on a new line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t indicating the number of test cases, an integer n indicating the size of the list a, and a list a of n integers. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the frequency of each integer in the list a and appends the result to a list. Finally, it prints each result from the list on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. The program counts combinations of sticks without checking the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
3
1 1 1
3
2 2 1
1
1
```

- For the first test case (3 sticks with lengths 1, 1, 1), the program will correctly output `1` because there is only one way to choose 3 sticks (since all sticks are the same length).
- For the second test case (3 sticks with lengths 2, 2, 1), the program will incorrectly output `3` instead of `1`. The valid combination is (2, 2, 1), but the program counts (2, 1, 2), (2, 2, 1), and (1, 2, 2) as separate valid combinations, which is incorrect.

The program needs to check the triangle inequality before counting the valid combinations. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = [int(data[idx + i]) for i in range(n)]
        idx += n
        cnt = 0
        for comb in combinations(a, 3):
            if comb[0] + comb[1] > comb[2] and comb[1] + comb[2] > comb[0] and comb[2] + comb[0] > comb[1]:
                cnt += 1
        results.append(str(cnt))
    print('\n'.join(results))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

This corrected version uses `combinations` from the `itertools` module to generate all possible combinations of three sticks and checks the triangle inequality theorem for each combination.
