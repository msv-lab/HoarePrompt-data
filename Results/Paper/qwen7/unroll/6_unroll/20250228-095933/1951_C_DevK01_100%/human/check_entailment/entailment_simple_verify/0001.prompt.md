You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #State: After executing the loop for `t` iterations, the output state will consist of `t` printed costs, each calculated based on the specific inputs provided for each iteration. The cost is determined by sorting the second input list `M`, selecting the first `q` elements where `q` is the ceiling of `k/m`, and then calculating the cost according to the given conditions. Each iteration modifies `n`, `m`, `k`, and `N` based on the input lists `L` and `M`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` representing the number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers `M` representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days.

2. **Setting Up Variables:**
   - `m` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k` because the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day cannot exceed `m`.
   - `M` is sorted in ascending order to facilitate the calculation of the minimum cost.

3. **Calculating the Number of Days Needed:**
   - `q` is calculated as the ceiling of `k / m`. This represents the number of days needed to purchase `k` tickets if we can buy `m` tickets per day.

4. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - If `n * m == k`, it means that buying `m` tickets per day for `n` days will exactly cover `k` tickets.
     - The cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, where `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.
   - Otherwise, the last ticket(s) might need to be bought on the last day(s).
     - `w` is the last element of `N`.
     - `mu` is the number of tickets left to buy after buying `m` tickets per day for `n - 1` days.
     - The cost is calculated accordingly, including the cost of the last day's tickets.

5. **Output:**
   - The total cost is printed for each test case.

### Verification of Correctness

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program seems to correctly handle the different scenarios described in the problem statement. Here are a few key points to verify:

- The sorting of `M` ensures that we are considering the cheapest options first.
- The handling of the cases where `n * m == k` and when there are leftover tickets to be bought on the last day(s) is appropriately managed.
- The use of `math.ceil(k / m)` ensures that we account for any fractional days needed to buy the required tickets.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.
