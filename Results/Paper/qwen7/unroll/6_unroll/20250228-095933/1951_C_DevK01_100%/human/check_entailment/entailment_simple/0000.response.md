Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the list of ticket prices `a`.

2. **Sorting and Calculation**:
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `M`.
   - It calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k/m`, which determines how many tickets can be bought without increasing the price.
   - It then selects the first `q` elements from the sorted list `M` and calculates the cost accordingly.
   - If `n * m` equals `k`, it calculates the cost directly using the selected elements.
   - Otherwise, it handles the remaining tickets by adjusting the cost calculation.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n * m` equals `k`.
   - It also correctly handles the case where `n * m` is greater than `k` by breaking down the purchase into multiple days and adjusting the price accordingly.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is calculated based on the given conditions.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the logic appears to be correct. The program correctly calculates the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
