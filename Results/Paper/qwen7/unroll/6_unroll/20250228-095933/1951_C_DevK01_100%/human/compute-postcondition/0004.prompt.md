You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n⋅m, 10^9); a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each i.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
        
        m = min(m, k)
        
        M.sort()
        
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        
        N = M[:q]
        
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w
            n = len(N)
            cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu
        
        print(cost)
        
        continue
        
    #State: After executing the loop for `t` iterations, the output state will consist of `t` printed costs, each calculated based on the specific inputs provided for each iteration. The cost is determined by sorting the second input list `M`, selecting the first `q` elements where `q` is the ceiling of `k/m`, and then calculating the cost according to the given conditions. Each iteration modifies `n`, `m`, `k`, and `N` based on the input lists `L` and `M`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a single integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case `i` (where 1 ≤ i ≤ t), it accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n⋅m, 10^9). Additionally, it accepts a list `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes each test case according to the given parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
