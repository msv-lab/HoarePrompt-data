Output State: **`max_sum` is the sum of the longest contiguous subarray with non-negative elements, `arr` is the original list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the subarray with the maximum sum of non-negative elements and its ending index, `segments_variants` is a list of subarrays that have sums greater than or equal to `max_sum`, and `segments_variants` now includes `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` to the list `segments_variants`. Since `new_segment` is an empty list, this effectively adds `[len(arr) - 1]` to `segments_variants`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
