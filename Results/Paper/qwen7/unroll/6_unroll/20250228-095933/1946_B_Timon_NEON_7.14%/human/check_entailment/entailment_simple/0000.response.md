### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array after performing \( k \) operations.
   - Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
   - The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The key insight is that inserting the sum of any subarray multiple times will increase the overall sum.
   - The optimal strategy is to use the largest possible positive subarray sum repeatedly.

3. **Analyze `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray with non-negative elements.
   - It iterates through the array, keeping track of the current segment sum and updating the maximum segment sum found so far.
   - If a negative element is encountered, it resets the current segment sum.
   - The function returns the maximum segment sum found, which is stored in `max_segment[0]`.

4. **Analyze `func_1`**:
   - This function simply computes the remainder of the input number when divided by \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - This is necessary to handle large sums that could exceed the integer limit.

5. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic calculates the maximum possible sum after \( k \) operations.
   - It uses the result from `func_2` to get the maximum segment sum.
   - It then calculates the new sum as `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1` to ensure the result is within the modulo limit.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `max_segment[0]` might be `-1` by setting it to `0` if needed.
   - This ensures that even if no positive segment is found, the calculation still works correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after \( k \) operations. The functions `func_2` and `func_1` are implemented as required, and the main logic is sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
