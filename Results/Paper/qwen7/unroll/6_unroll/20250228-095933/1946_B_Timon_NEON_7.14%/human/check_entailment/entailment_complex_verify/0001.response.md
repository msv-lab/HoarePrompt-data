### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the remainder of a number when divided by \(10^9 + 7\). It is used to ensure the final result fits within the required constraints.
   - **Correct**: This function is implemented correctly.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The goal of `func_2` is to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray with non-negative elements.
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray. For example, it does not handle cases where multiple subarrays have the same maximum sum but different starting indices.
   - **Incorrect**: The function `func_2` is not correctly identifying the maximum sum subarray.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - The function `func_3` is declared but left empty. It is supposed to perform some operations based on the sum of the array and the number of operations \(k\), but since it is empty, it cannot be used in the solution.
   - **Incorrect**: This function is not implemented, which means it cannot be used in the solution.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The current implementation of `func_2` attempts to manage segments and update the maximum segment found so far. However, the logic is incorrect. For instance, the logic inside the loop does not correctly handle cases where multiple subarrays have the same maximum sum but different starting indices. The current implementation only appends the last segment to `segments_variants` without considering the starting index.
  - Example: Consider the array `[4, -2, 8, -12, 9]`. The maximum sum subarray is `[4, -2, 8]` with a sum of `10`. However, the current implementation might not correctly identify this subarray due to the flawed logic.

- **Function `func_3`**:
  - Since `func_3` is empty, it cannot be used in the solution. The solution relies on `func_3` to perform some operations, but since it is not implemented, the solution is incomplete and incorrect.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The functions `func_2` and `func_3` are either incorrectly implemented or not implemented at all, leading to an incorrect solution.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
