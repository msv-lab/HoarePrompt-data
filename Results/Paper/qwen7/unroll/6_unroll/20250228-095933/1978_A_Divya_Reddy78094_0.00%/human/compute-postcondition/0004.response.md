Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 <= t <= 500) indicating the number of sub-cases, followed by t pairs of integers. For each pair, the first integer n (2 <= n <= 100) represents the count of subsequent integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The function returns results based on the processing of these test cases.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` specifying the number of sub-cases. Each sub-case then involves an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`. The function processes these inputs and returns the results accordingly.
