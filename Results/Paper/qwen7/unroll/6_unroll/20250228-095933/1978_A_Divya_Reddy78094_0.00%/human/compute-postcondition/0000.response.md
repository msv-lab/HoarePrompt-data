Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now equal to the integer input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial condition that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 500` remains valid, and now `t` holds the specific value entered by the user within this range.
