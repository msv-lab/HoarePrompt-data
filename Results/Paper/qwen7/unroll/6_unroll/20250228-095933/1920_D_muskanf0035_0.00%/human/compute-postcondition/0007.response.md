Output State: `array` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list.

Explanation: The loop iterates over `queries`, appending elements to `result` based on the indices specified in `queries`. However, since `array` is initially an empty list, accessing any index of `array` will result in an error (IndexError), and the loop will not execute any operations on `array` or `result`. Therefore, both `array` and `result` remain empty lists after the loop completes.
