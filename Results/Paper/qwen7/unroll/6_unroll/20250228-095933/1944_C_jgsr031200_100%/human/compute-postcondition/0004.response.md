Output State: **`cou` is 0, `freq` is a list of integers where each index `i` (with \(0 \le i < n\)) contains the frequency of `i` in the original list `arr`. All other elements in `freq` up to index `n` are still zeros.**

Explanation: The variable `cou` is initialized to 0, and no changes are made to the list `freq`. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `cou` with the value 0.
