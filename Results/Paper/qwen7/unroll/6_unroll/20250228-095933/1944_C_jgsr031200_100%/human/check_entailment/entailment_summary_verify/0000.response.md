### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the example input.

1. **Problem Description and Expected Behavior**:
   - Alice and Bob play a game where Alice starts by picking an element from the array `a` and appending it to her array `c`, then deleting it from `a`. Bob then picks an element from `a` and deletes it without adding it to `c`.
   - The game continues until `a` is empty, and the final score is the MEX of `c`.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` and checks the frequency of each element in the list.
   - If it finds any element with a frequency of 1 or 0, it prints and breaks from the loop.
   - This function does not simulate the game turns or calculate the MEX value correctly.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - `func_1` initializes a frequency list `freq` and counts the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the frequency list to find the first element with a frequency of 1 or 0 and prints it.
   - However, this approach does not simulate the game turns and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

4. **Example Input and Output**:
   - Consider the example input:
     ```
     3
     4
     0 0 1 1
     4
     0 1 2 3
     2
     1 1
     ```
   - The expected output is:
     ```
     2
     1
     0
     ```

   - Let's walk through the first test case:
     - Alice picks `0`, so `c = [0]` and `a = [0, 1, 1]`.
     - Bob picks `0`, so `a = [1, 1]`.
     - Alice picks `1`, so `c = [0, 1]` and `a = [1]`.
     - Bob picks `1`, so `a = []`.
     - The MEX of `c = [0, 1]` is `2`.

   - The program should simulate these turns and compute the MEX correctly, but instead, it just counts the frequency of elements and prints the first element with a frequency of 1 or 0, which is not the correct approach.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly simulate the game turns and does not compute the MEX value correctly. The function `func_1` does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob, and thus, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
