Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. The program attempts to check for unique elements within the given range, but this is not relevant to the game's objective of determining the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

To solve this problem, we need to simulate the game where Alice and Bob make optimal moves. Hereâ€™s what the correct solution should do:

1. Alice will always pick the smallest available element to maximize the MEX.
2. Bob will always pick the smallest available element to minimize the MEX.

Given these rules, the game's outcome can be determined by the following logic:
- If there are more than two unique elements in the array, Alice can always pick the smallest element, and Bob will pick the next smallest, ensuring that the MEX will be 2.
- If there are exactly two unique elements, Alice can ensure that the MEX is 1 by picking one of them.
- If there is only one unique element, the MEX will be 0.
- If there are no unique elements, the MEX will be 1.

The provided code does not simulate this logic at all. Instead, it simply checks for elements with a frequency of 1 or 0, which is irrelevant to the game's outcome.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
