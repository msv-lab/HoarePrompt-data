Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the given problem statement. The logic in the `if` condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0` is incorrect for determining the winner. Instead, the key insight is that the player whose turn it is when the total number of coins is odd will always win if both players play optimally. Here's why:

- If the total number of coins is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force the second player (Bob) into a losing position by ensuring that after each of her moves, the total number of coins remains odd. This means she can always leave Bob with an even number of coins, forcing him to eventually face a situation where he cannot make a valid move.
- Conversely, if the total number of coins is even, the second player (Bob) can adopt a similar strategy to ensure he wins.

Therefore, the correct logic should check if the sum of `a` and `b` is odd or even, and then print the appropriate name based on that.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This corrected version correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
