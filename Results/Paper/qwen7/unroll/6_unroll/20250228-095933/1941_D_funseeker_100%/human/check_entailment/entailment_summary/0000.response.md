Reasoning:
- The program consists of five functions, but only `func_4` is relevant to solving the problem as described. The other functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`) are used to read input data.
- `func_4` correctly processes the input data and simulates the ball throws according to the rules specified in the problem statement.
- It initializes the set `ans` with the starting position `x`.
- For each throw, it updates the set `ans` to include both possible positions (clockwise and counterclockwise) based on the direction `c` and the distance `r`.
- It handles the special case where the ball could be at position 0 by adding `n` to the set.
- Finally, it prints the number of distinct possible positions and the sorted list of these positions.

Given the problem description and the execution summary of `func_4`, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
