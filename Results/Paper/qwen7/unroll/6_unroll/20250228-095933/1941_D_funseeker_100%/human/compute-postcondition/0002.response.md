Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `m`, which is the number of iterations the loop will run.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `_` is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop's execution directly. It is incremented internally by the loop mechanism.
   - `m` is the number of times the loop will run. For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1.

3. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop will run `m` times, `m` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`n`, `x`, and `ans`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `m` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` must be greater than 0**
