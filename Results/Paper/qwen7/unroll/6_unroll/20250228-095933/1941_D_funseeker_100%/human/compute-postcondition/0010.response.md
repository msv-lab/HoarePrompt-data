Based on the initial state described, let's break down the situation:

1. **Set `ans`**: This set contains the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws. Each throw adds or subtracts a value `r` determined by `func_1()`, and the starting position `x` remains unchanged.

2. **Condition for Updating `ans`**: If `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` is updated to include `n` added to the possible positions in `ans`, excluding `0`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

Given this, the `print(*sorted(ans))` statement will print the sorted elements of the set `ans`.

Since the exact values of `m`, `x`, `r`, `func_1()`, `n`, and the initial positions after `m` throws are not provided, we cannot determine the exact elements of `ans`. However, we know that if `0` is in `ans`, it will be removed and `n` will be added to the remaining elements. If `0` is not in `ans`, it will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output will be the sorted elements of the modified `ans` set, where `0` is removed if present and `n` is added to the remaining elements.

Output: **sorted elements of ans with 0 removed and n added to the remaining elements (if 0 is in ans)**
