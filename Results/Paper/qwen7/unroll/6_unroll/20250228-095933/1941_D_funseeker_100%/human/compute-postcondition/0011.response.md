Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but returns a string containing the distance and direction of a throw.**

Given the context, the function `func_4()` does not take any parameters. Instead, it seems to rely on other functions like `func_1()` and `func_3()` to provide the necessary data. However, based solely on the description of `func_4()`, it returns a string that includes two pieces of information: the distance (`r`) and the direction (`c`) of a throw.
