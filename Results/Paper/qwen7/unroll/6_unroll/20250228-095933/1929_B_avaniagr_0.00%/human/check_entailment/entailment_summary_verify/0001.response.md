### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the given solution step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.

#### Given Solution:
```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function reads test cases from standard input.
- For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the conditions:
  - If \( k < 4n - 3 \), it prints \( k // 2 + k \% 2 \).
  - If \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), it prints \( 2n \).
  - If \( k = 4n - 2 \), it prints \( 2n \).

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Case 1: \( k < 4n - 3 \)**
   - The formula \( k // 2 + k \% 2 \) gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( k / 2 \).
   - This is correct because we need to color enough cells to cover at least \( k \) diagonals, and the smallest number of cells required is indeed \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

2. **Case 2: \( k \geq 4n - 3 \)**
   - The formula \( 2n \) is used.
   - This is correct because when \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), we need to color at least one cell in every diagonal. Since there are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals, coloring one cell per diagonal would require \( 4n - 2 \) cells. However, since we can reuse cells across rows and columns, we can achieve this with \( 2n \) cells by coloring one cell in each row and one cell in each column.

3. **Case 3: \( k = 4n - 2 \)**
   - The formula \( 2n \) is used.
   - This is correct because when \( k = 4n - 2 \), we need to color exactly one cell in each of the \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals. Again, we can achieve this with \( 2n \) cells by coloring one cell in each row and one cell in each column.

#### Testing the Logic:
- The solution handles all cases correctly based on the problem statement and examples provided.
- Edge cases like \( k = 4n - 2 \) are handled appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The given solution correctly handles all cases and provides the minimum number of cells to color for each test case.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The program is correct.
