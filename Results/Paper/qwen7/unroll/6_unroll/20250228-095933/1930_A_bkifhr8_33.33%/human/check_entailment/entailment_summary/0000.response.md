Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. The program attempts to calculate the sum of the minimum values of all possible pairs of numbers from the given list. However, there are several issues with the logic used to achieve this:
   - The program incorrectly removes elements from the list in a way that does not guarantee the optimal pairing.
   - The condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is unnecessary and incorrect because it breaks the loop prematurely when only two elements are left.
   - The program does not ensure that the smallest elements are paired together, which is necessary to maximize the score.
4. The program's approach to pairing elements is flawed and does not guarantee the optimal solution.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required algorithm to find the maximum final score.

Correctness: **False**
