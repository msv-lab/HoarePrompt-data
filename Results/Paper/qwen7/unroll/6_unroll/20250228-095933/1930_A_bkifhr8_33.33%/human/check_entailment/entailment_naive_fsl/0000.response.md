Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the list contains duplicate smallest elements correctly. Specifically, the program assumes that the list will always have at least two elements to compare, but it fails to handle the scenario where the list has only one element left after each comparison. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2
1 1
```

The expected output is `1`, because the optimal strategy is to pick the two `1`s and add their minimum value (`1`) to the score. However, the program will incorrectly process this input as follows:
1. Initialize `ans` to `0`.
2. Split the input into `lst = ['1', '1']`.
3. Add `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` to `ans`, which is `1`.
4. Remove the first two elements from `lst`, leaving an empty list.
5. Since the list is now empty, the program breaks out of the loop without adding the last remaining element to the score.

Thus, the program outputs `1` instead of the correct `1`. This shows that the program does not handle the case where the list has only one element left after each comparison correctly, leading to incorrect results.
