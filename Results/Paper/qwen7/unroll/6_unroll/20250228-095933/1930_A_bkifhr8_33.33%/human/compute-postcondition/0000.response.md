Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`, after executing the code, `t` retains this property but now holds the actual value input by the user. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
