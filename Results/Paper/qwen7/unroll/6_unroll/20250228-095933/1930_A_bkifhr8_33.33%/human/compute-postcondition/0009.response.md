Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t and an integer n, along with 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum values of all possible pairs of numbers from the given list and stores these sums in a list ans_f. Finally, it prints each element of ans_f.**
