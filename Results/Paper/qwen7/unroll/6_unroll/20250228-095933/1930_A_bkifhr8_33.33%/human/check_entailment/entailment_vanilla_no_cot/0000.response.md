Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of List Length**: The logic inside the loop where it checks `if len(lst) != 2:` is flawed. This condition is only checked once, and the loop structure does not ensure that pairs are always selected optimally. It should process all elements in pairs until the list is empty.

2. **Incorrect Pairs Selection**: The code attempts to remove elements at specific indices (`lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`), which is incorrect. It should sort the list and then pair the smallest elements together to maximize the score.

3. **Unnecessary Break Statement**: The `break` statement is unnecessary and incorrectly placed. It should continue processing all elements until the list is empty.

4. **Improper Input Handling**: The input handling for the list of numbers is not optimal. Instead of splitting the string and converting each element separately, it would be better to handle the entire list directly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()  # Sort the list to ensure we always pick the minimum of the current pair
        ans = 0
        while lst:
            ans += lst.pop(0)  # Add the smaller of the current pair
            if lst:
                lst.pop(0)  # Remove the next element as well
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
```

This corrected version ensures that the list is sorted and processes pairs optimally to achieve the maximum score.
