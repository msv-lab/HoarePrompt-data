You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers on the whiteboard are 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        
        n = int(input())
        
        l = input()
        
        lst = l.split(' ')
        
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:

                break
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000; `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values of pairs of numbers for each input case, where each pair is taken from the list of space-separated integers provided for each case.
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values of pairs of numbers for each input case, and the loop prints each element of `ans_f`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t and an integer n, along with 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum values of all possible pairs of numbers from the given list and stores these sums in a list ans_f. Finally, it prints each element of ans_f.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes the score `ans` to 0 and reads the value of `n` and the list of integers.
3. **List Splitting**: The program splits the input string `l` into a list of strings `lst`. However, this approach is problematic because the input is already space-separated integers, and splitting it again might not work as expected. Instead, we should directly convert the input string into a list of integers.
4. **Score Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the score by repeatedly taking the minimum of the first two elements in the list and adding it to the score. It then removes these two elements from the list. This logic seems correct at first glance.
5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where the list has an odd length properly. Since `2n` integers are always provided, this should not be an issue, but the code should still be robust.
6. **Output**: The program correctly appends the final score for each test case to the list `ans_f` and prints the results at the end.

However, there is a subtle issue with the loop condition and how the list is being manipulated. The loop condition `for i in range(n * 2)` and the way elements are removed from the list might lead to incorrect behavior if the list is not handled carefully.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the list to ensure we always pick the smallest elements
        lst.sort()
        
        for _ in range(n):
            ans += lst.pop(0)  # Take the smallest element
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
    
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Sorting the List**: Sorting the list ensures that we always pick the smallest elements, which is necessary to maximize the score.
- **Using `pop(0)`**: Instead of manually managing the removal of elements, using `pop(0)` simplifies the process and ensures that we always remove the smallest element.

Given the above reasoning, the original program has a logical flaw due to the incorrect handling of the list elements. However, if we assume the sorting step is added, the program would be correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

The original program needs the addition of sorting the list to ensure the optimal solution is achieved.
