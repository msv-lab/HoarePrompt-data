Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Specifically, the program fails to account for the fact that chips can only be moved to the closest free cell to the left, and it does not handle the logic of moving chips efficiently.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
The expected output is `1`, because we can move the chip in the 7th cell to the 5th cell, resulting in all chips being in a single block.

However, the provided program simply counts the number of consecutive zeros at the end of the list, which does not reflect the actual minimum number of operations needed to move all chips to a single block. This approach will fail for many cases, including the one mentioned above.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to count the number of gaps (consecutive zeros) between the chips and ensure that we move chips to minimize these gaps. The provided solution does not achieve this.
