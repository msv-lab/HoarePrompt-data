State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, _ is not relevant as it is a placeholder index**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t`, which is used to determine the number of iterations.
- The variable `_` is a placeholder index and does not affect the loop's execution condition; therefore, it does not need to be adjusted.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be an integer within the specified range (1 to 1000 inclusive).

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
