Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The solution removes leading and trailing zeros and then counts the number of zeros remaining, which does not necessarily give the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of moving chips to the left until they form a single block. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the index of the first chip
        first_chip_index = next(i for i, x in enumerate(a) if x == 1)
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of moves
        res = 0
        for i in range(first_chip_index + 1, n):
            if a[i] == 1:
                res += i - first_chip_index - 1
        
        print(res)
```

This solution works as follows:
1. It finds the index of the first chip.
2. It then iterates through the array starting from the first chip's position.
3. For each subsequent chip, it calculates the number of moves required to bring it to the block formed by previous chips and adds this to the result.
4. Finally, it prints the result.

This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations is calculated correctly.
