Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) indicating the number of cells, and a list of n integers (each either 0 or 1) indicating whether each cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1). The function returns the result for each test case, which is "contains chip" if at least one cell contains a chip, otherwise "no chip".**
