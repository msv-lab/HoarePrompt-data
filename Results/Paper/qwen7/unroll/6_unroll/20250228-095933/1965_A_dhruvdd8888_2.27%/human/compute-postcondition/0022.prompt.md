You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each pile i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = set(input().split())
    nums = sorted(map(int, nums))
    if (len(nums) == 1) :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program prints 'Alice'
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, and `nums` is a list of the unique elements from the input sorted in ascending order. The length of `nums` is greater than 1
    if (len(nums) == 2) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program prints 'Bob'
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, and `nums` is a list of unique elements from the input sorted in ascending order with a length greater than 2.
    nums.insert(0, 0)
    cd = 0
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1:
            cd += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `cd` is the length of the longest consecutive sequence of numbers starting from the second element of the list `nums`, `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `nums` is a list with an additional element 0 inserted at the beginning, and the rest of the list remains unchanged.
    if (cd & 1) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program prints 'Bob' and returns None
    else :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program prints 'Alice'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a list of integers and determines whether to print 'Alice' or 'Bob'. Depending on the conditions, it may also return None.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program prints 'Alice'

Case_2: The program prints 'Bob'

Case_3: The program prints 'Bob' and returns None

Case_4: The program prints 'Alice'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
