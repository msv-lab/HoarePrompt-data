Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `count` is initialized to 2.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop runs while `count` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
     - `g` is calculated as `n / count`.
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
     - `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1` to it.
     - `count` is incremented by 1.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the result is printed as an integer.

### Correctness Check

To verify the correctness, let's compare the logic with the problem statement:

1. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The program does not explicitly check this condition. Instead, it uses a heuristic approach to count the valid pairs.

2. **Heuristic Approach**:
   - The heuristic used in the program seems to be counting pairs where \(a\) is a multiple of some value derived from `count`.
   - This approach does not directly ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as when `n` or `m` is 1, which should be straightforward.
   - It also does not handle the case where `n` and `m` are very large, which could lead to incorrect results due to floating-point precision issues.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- For the test case `(1, 1)`, the output is `1`, which is correct.
- For the test case `(2, 3)`, the output is `3`, which is correct.
- For the test case `(3, 5)`, the output is `4`, which is correct.
- For the test case `(10, 8)`, the output is `14`, which is correct.
- For the test case `(100, 1233)`, the output is `153`, which is correct.
- For the test case `(1000000, 1145141)`, the output is `1643498`, which is correct.

However, the heuristic approach used in the program does not guarantee that all valid pairs are counted correctly. The program might miss some valid pairs or include invalid ones.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
