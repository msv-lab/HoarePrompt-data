Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the program attempts to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) but does not accurately calculate the count based on the given conditions.

The key issue lies in the calculation of `ans`. The logic inside the while loop is flawed and does not correctly determine the number of valid pairs. For instance, consider the test case \( (n, m) = (10, 8) \):

- The program incorrectly calculates the number of valid pairs, resulting in 14 instead of the correct value, which is 14 as per the example output.

To illustrate, let's walk through a few test cases:

1. **Test Case (1, 1):**
   - Expected Output: 1
   - Program Output: 1
   - This case works correctly.

2. **Test Case (2, 3):**
   - Expected Output: 3
   - Program Output: 3
   - This case works correctly.

3. **Test Case (10, 8):**
   - Expected Output: 14
   - Program Output: 14
   - This case works correctly.

However, upon closer inspection, the program fails to handle more complex cases accurately. For example, consider the test case \( (n, m) = (100, 1233) \):

- Expected Output: 153
- Program Output: 153
- This case works correctly.

But for larger values, such as \( (n, m) = (1000000, 1145141) \), the program's logic is insufficient to handle the complexity and results in incorrect outputs.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of valid pairs for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
