Output State: The value of `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. For each iteration `i` from 0 to `t-1`, two integers `n` and `m` are read from input. The variable `ans` is initialized to `n` and updated based on the values of `n` and `m`. After processing all `t` iterations, the final value of `ans` for each iteration is printed.
