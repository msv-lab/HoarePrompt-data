Output State: The value of `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. For each value of `i` from 0 to `t-1`, the program reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, where `n` and `m` are positive integers. It then calculates a value `ans` based on the given logic and prints the result for each iteration. The final output state consists of `t` lines, each containing the calculated value of `ans` for the corresponding input pair `(n, m)`.
