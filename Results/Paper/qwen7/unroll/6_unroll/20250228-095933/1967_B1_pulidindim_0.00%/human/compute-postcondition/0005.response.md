Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates a value \( ans \) based on specific conditions and prints the result. The function ensures that \( n \) and \( m \) are within the specified bounds and that their cumulative sum does not exceed a certain limit. After processing all test cases, it outputs the calculated value \( ans \) for each test case.**
