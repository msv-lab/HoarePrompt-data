Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `num`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - Before the loop starts, `counter` is 0.
   - `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\).

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `len(num) - 1` to `-1` in steps of `-1`.
   - This means `i` will take values from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`.

4. **Determine the Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be initialized to a value within the specified range.
   - Specifically, `i` should start at `len(num) - 1`, which is the highest possible value for `i`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is the primary variable that drives the loop, we need to set `i` to `len(num) - 1`.
   - We also need to ensure that `num` is within the valid range \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\).

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`counter` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, `num` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\)**.
