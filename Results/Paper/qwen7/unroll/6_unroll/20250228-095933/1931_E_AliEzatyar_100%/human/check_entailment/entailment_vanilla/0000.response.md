Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - It initializes an array `answers` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and the list of integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It splits the input string into individual numbers and calculates the total number of digits (`total_digits`).
   - It also counts the number of trailing zeros in each number using the function `func_1` and stores these counts in the `zeros` list.
   - The `zeros` list is sorted in descending order.

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - It iterates through the `zeros` list in steps of 2, summing up the values.
   - It checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If the condition is met, it assigns 'Sasha' to the corresponding position in `answers`; otherwise, it assigns 'Anna'.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function counts the number of trailing zeros in a given number.
   - It iterates through the string representation of the number in reverse order until it finds a non-zero digit.
   - It returns the count of trailing zeros.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The logic used to determine the winner is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that Sasha wins if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. This is not aligned with the game rules provided in the problem statement.

2. **Handling of Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program correctly counts trailing zeros but uses them in a way that does not reflect the game's strategy accurately.

3. **Game Strategy Not Implemented:**
   - The program does not implement the optimal strategy for both players as described in the problem. It does not simulate the game moves or consider the game state after each move.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and cannot determine the winner based on the optimal play of both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
