Reasoning:
The provided program does not match the problem description and the intended logic for solving the problem. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is defined to count trailing zeros in the binary representation of a number. However, the problem requires reversing the digits of the decimal representation of the numbers in the list, not counting trailing zeros in their binary representation.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner**: The logic in the program tries to determine the winner based on the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the numbers. This approach is incorrect because it does not align with the rules of the game as described. Specifically:
   - Anna's move involves reversing the digits of a chosen number.
   - Sasha's move involves concatenating two chosen numbers.
   - The game ends when Sasha cannot make a move, and the winner is determined based on whether the remaining number is at least \(10^m\).

3. **Game Rules Not Implemented**: The program does not implement the actual game rules. It does not simulate the turns of Anna and Sasha, nor does it correctly determine the winner based on the game's conditions.

Given these points, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
