Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each element a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, R is a lambda function that maps input integers from a space-separated input.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads multiple integers from input and splits them into a tuple of integers. However, it does not execute the reading process, so the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `q` remain unchanged. The lambda function `R` is now available for use in future code snippets.
