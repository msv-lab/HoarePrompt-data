Output State: t test cases are processed, each test case outputs an array ans of length n, where ans[i] is either \(2^i\) or 0, and the last element of ans is always 0 if the number of elements in ans is less than n. The specific values of ans are determined based on the binary representation of k, with each set bit in k corresponding to a power of 2 in the ans array.
