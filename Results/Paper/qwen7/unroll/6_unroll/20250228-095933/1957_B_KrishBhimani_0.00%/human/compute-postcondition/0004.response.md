Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two integers n and k. For each test case, it constructs an array ans of length n. This array contains either \(2^i\) or 0 for each index i, based on the binary representation of k. Specifically, if the i-th bit of k is set, ans[i] will be \(2^i\); otherwise, it will be 0. The function ensures that the last element of ans is always 0 if the array length is less than n. After processing all test cases, it prints the resulting array ans for each test case.**
