Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value that determines the number of iterations.

2. **Understand the Input**: The input is an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The constraints are that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.

3. **Determine the Adjustments Needed**: Since the loop will execute `t` times, `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range. The initial state mentions that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will run exactly `t` times, where `t` is the integer input from the user.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
