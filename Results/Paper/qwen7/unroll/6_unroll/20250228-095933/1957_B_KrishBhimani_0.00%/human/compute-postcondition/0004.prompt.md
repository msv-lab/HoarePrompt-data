You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        
        n, k = list(map(int, l1))
        
        arr = []
        
        k0 = k
        
        i = 0
        
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1
        
        ans = []
        
        c = 0
        
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: Output State: t test cases are processed, each test case outputs an array ans of length n, where ans[i] is either \(2^i\) or 0, and the last element of ans is always 0 if the number of elements in ans is less than n. The specific values of ans are determined based on the binary representation of k, with each set bit in k corresponding to a power of 2 in the ans array.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a series of test cases where each test case includes two integers n and k. For each test case, if n and k meet the specified constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n values does not exceed 2⋅10^5), the function performs some operation or returns a value based on n and k. If any constraint is violated, the function may handle it appropriately.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
