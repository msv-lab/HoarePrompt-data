Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Moves**: The logic to calculate the remaining moves `n` after the initial `k` moves is flawed. Specifically, the code subtracts 2 from `n` whenever the row and column indices are different (`a != b`) and subtracts 1 when they are the same (`a == b`). This logic is not correct because the problem specifies that the computer mirrors your move if `a != b`, effectively removing two positions (one for you and one for the computer) from the available choices. However, the logic should account for the fact that the computer's move is already placed, so only one position should be removed from the available choices.

2. **Function `func_1` Implementation**: The function `func_1` is calculating something related to dynamic programming, but it is not correctly implemented to solve the problem. The problem requires counting the number of valid final configurations, which involves combinatorial counting rather than dynamic programming.

3. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is applied to the result of the dynamic programming calculation, but this is not necessary for the problem's requirements. The problem asks for the number of configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\), but the current implementation does not correctly compute the number of configurations.

### Correct Solution:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to use combinatorial counting. Hereâ€™s a corrected approach:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, k = L[0], L[1]
    invalid_positions = set()
    
    for _ in range(k):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        invalid_positions.add((a-1, b-1))
        if a != b:
            invalid_positions.add((b-1, a-1))
    
    # Calculate the number of valid rows and columns left
    valid_rows = n - len({pos[0] for pos in invalid_positions})
    valid_cols = n - len({pos[1] for pos in invalid_positions})
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions
    configurations = 1
    for i in range(valid_rows):
        configurations *= (valid_cols - i)
        configurations %= (10**9 + 7)
    
    print(configurations)
```

This solution correctly counts the number of valid rows and columns after the initial moves and calculates the number of ways to place the remaining rooks using combinatorial counting.
