Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard after \(k\) moves, where each move is mirrored by the opponent. The solution uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations.

2. **Dynamic Programming Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function initializes a list `dp` with `[1, 1]`.
   - For each \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), it updates `dp` using the recurrence relation \((dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) \% (10^9 + 7)\).
   - This ensures that the calculations are done modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(n\) and \(k\), and the positions of the rooks placed so far.
   - It adjusts \(n\) based on whether the rook placements were along the diagonal (subtract 1) or not (subtract 2).
   - Finally, it calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations.

4. **Verification**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for calculating the number of configurations.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

Given this analysis, the provided Python program is correct according to the problem description and the execution summary.
