Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the program subtracts 2 from `n` whenever the rook is placed on a diagonal (i.e., `a != b`) and subtracts 1 when the rook is placed off-diagonally (i.e., `a == b`). However, this approach is incorrect because it does not account for the remaining valid positions correctly.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining board after accounting for the initial moves. The program should use combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of valid configurations. Here's a brief outline of the correct approach:

1. Start with `n` rows and columns available.
2. For each move, remove the corresponding row and column from consideration.
3. Calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining board using combinatorial methods.

The provided solution does not follow this logic and instead uses a dynamic programming approach (`func_1`) that is not relevant to the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
