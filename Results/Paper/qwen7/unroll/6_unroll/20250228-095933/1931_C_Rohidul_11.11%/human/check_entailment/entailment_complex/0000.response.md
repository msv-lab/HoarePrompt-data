Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal using at most one operation. Each operation can set a contiguous subarray to a single value, and the cost of the operation is the length of the subarray.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then counts the number of consecutive duplicates at the start (`st`) and end (`end`) of the array.
   - Depending on whether the first and last elements are equal, it calculates the length of the subarray that needs to be changed.
   - The function prints the result, which is the maximum length of the subarray that needs to be changed to make all elements equal.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The logic for counting consecutive duplicates at the start and end is correct.
   - The calculation of the subarray length to change is based on the assumption that the optimal operation is to change the longest possible subarray that starts from either the first or the last element.
   - The function correctly handles the edge cases where the first and last elements are equal or different, and there are no consecutive duplicates at the start or end.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array is already uniform, no operation is needed.
   - If the first and last elements are different and there are no consecutive duplicates at the start or end, changing the entire array except the first and last elements is the optimal solution.
   - If the first and last elements are the same, the optimal solution is to change the subarray from the first to the last element, excluding the first and last elements if they are part of a larger sequence of duplicates.

Given the analysis, the function correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

Correctness: **True**
