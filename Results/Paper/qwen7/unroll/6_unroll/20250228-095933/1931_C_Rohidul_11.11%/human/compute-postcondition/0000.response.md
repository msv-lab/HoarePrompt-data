Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input from `int(input())`, which we will denote as `t`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `t` (the input value) is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to explicitly state that `t` must be within this range.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
