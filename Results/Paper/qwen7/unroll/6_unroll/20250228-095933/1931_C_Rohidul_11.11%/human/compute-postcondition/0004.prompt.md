You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        l, r = 0, n - 1
        
        st, end = 0, 0
        
        while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
            l += 1
            st += 1
        
        while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
            r -= 1
            end += 1
        
        if a[0] == a[-1]:
            ans = r - l - 1
        elif st == 0 and end == 0 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            ans = len(a) - 1
        else:
            ans = r - l
        
        print(max(0, ans))
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. After executing the loop, ans is an integer representing the maximum length of the subarray starting from either the first or last element (whichever has more consecutive elements), excluding the first and last elements if they are equal, or the entire array minus one if the first and last elements are different and there are no consecutive duplicates at the start or end. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It returns a result based on the given test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
