Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
2. The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:
   - The code only checks for consecutive duplicates at the start and end of the array and calculates the length of such subarrays.
   - It does not consider the possibility of making all elements equal by choosing any subarray and setting its values to a common value.
   - The logic for determining the minimum cost is incomplete and does not cover all possible scenarios.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal, which involves identifying the optimal subarray to modify and the value to set it to. This typically involves iterating through the array to find the minimum and maximum values and then calculating the cost for each possible subarray modification.

Given the current implementation, it does not address the core requirements of the problem, hence it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
