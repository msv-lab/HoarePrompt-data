Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}.**

The code initializes an empty list `ans_list`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or the list `a`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
