Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` by strategically purchasing additional cards. However, the logic used to determine how many cards to purchase and where to place them is flawed.

For instance, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
3 4
6 1 8
```
- Expected Output: `15`
- Actual Output: The program's output is incorrect.

The program sorts the array and then tries to calculate the maximum score by purchasing cards to minimize the gaps between consecutive numbers. However, this approach does not always yield the correct result because it does not account for the optimal way to distribute the purchased cards to achieve the maximum score.

A more accurate approach would involve a dynamic programming or a sliding window technique to evaluate the best way to insert the purchased cards to maximize the number of valid subarrays. The current implementation does not handle all edge cases and does not guarantee the maximum score for all inputs.
