Functionality: **The function processes `t` iterations of input data consisting of integers `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each iteration, it calculates a value `ans` based on the sorted list `a` and the integer `k`. The function then appends each calculated `ans` to a list `ans_list`. Finally, it prints each value in `ans_list`. The function returns nothing but modifies and outputs a list of calculated values.**
