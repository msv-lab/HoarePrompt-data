Output State: `ans_list` is a list containing integers calculated from the loop executions, with each element representing the final value of `ans` for each input iteration. The value of `t` is the number of iterations in the loop, and for each iteration, `n`, `k`, and `a` are updated based on user input, leading to a different `ans` value which is then appended to `ans_list`.
