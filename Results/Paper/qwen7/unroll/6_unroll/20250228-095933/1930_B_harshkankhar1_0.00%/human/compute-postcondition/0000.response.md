Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of integers from 1 to t (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was initially defined. The variable `a` is assigned a list generated by `range(1, int(input()) + 1)`. This means `a` will contain a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `t` (inclusive). The variable `n` is read from input but its value is not used to generate the list `a`. The precondition that the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\) remains valid, but since only one `n` is considered here, this condition is not directly impacted by the given code snippet.
