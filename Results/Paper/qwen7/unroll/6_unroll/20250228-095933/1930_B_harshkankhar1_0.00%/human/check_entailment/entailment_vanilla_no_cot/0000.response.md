Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Here's why:

- The function `func_1()` generates a permutation by reversing every other element (starting from the first element) of a list containing numbers from 1 to n.
- This approach does not guarantee that no two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) will satisfy the condition where \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{i+1}\).

### Example:
For \(n = 4\), the generated permutation would be `[4, 1, 2, 3]`. This permutation is not valid because:
- \(p_1 = 4\) divides \(p_3 = 2\) (since \(4 \div 2 = 2\)).
- \(p_2 = 1\) divides \(p_4 = 3\) (since \(3 \div 1 = 3\)).

Therefore, the solution provided does not meet the requirements of the problem. A correct solution should ensure that no such pair of indices exists in the permutation.

### Correct Approach:
A possible correct approach could involve generating a permutation where the relative ordering of elements ensures that no division conditions are met. One such method is to interleave odd and even numbers, ensuring that no element divides another in the specified manner.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    perm = []
    for i in range(n // 2):
        perm.append(i * 2 + 2)
        perm.append(i * 2 + 1)
    if n % 2 != 0:
        perm.append(n)
    print(perm)
```

This code generates a permutation by interleaving odd and even numbers, which helps in avoiding the division conditions.
