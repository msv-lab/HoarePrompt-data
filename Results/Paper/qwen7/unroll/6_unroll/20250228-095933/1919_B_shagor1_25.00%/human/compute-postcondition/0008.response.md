Functionality: **The function processes an input string `s` consisting of '+' and '-' characters and calculates a result based on the count of '-' characters in the string. Specifically, it prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`, where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `neg` is the number of '-' characters in `s`. The function implicitly handles multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a string `s`. After processing each test case, it outputs the calculated result.**
