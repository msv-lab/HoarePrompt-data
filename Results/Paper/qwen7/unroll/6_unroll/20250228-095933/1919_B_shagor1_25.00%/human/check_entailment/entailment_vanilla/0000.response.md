Reasoning:
1. Let's analyze the given program step-by-step.
2. The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
3. It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.
4. Inside `func_1()`, it reads the length `n` of the string `s` and the string `s` itself.
5. It counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores this count in `neg`.
6. It then calculates the result using the formula `n - 2 * neg` unless `n` is equal to `neg`, in which case it prints `n`.

Now, let's consider the problem requirements:
- The string `s` represents an array `a` where '+' corresponds to `1` and '-' corresponds to `-1`.
- The goal is to minimize the total penalty, which is the sum of the penalties of the subarrays formed by splitting `a` into non-empty parts.

The given solution does not actually perform the optimal split of the array `a`. Instead, it simply counts the number of '-' characters and uses a formula to calculate the result. This approach does not guarantee the minimum possible penalty because it does not consider the actual values in the array `a` and their arrangement.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to consider all possible ways to split the array and calculate the penalties, then choose the split that results in the minimum total penalty. However, the given solution does not do this.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
