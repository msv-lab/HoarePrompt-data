Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
- **Objective**: Determine the final score of the game, which is the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.
- **Game Rules**:
  - Alice picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and removes it from `a`.
  - Bob picks an element from `a` and removes it without appending it to `c`.
  - The game ends when `a` is empty.
- **Optimal Strategy**:
  - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
  - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of each element in `a` using a `defaultdict`. It then iterates through the elements and prints the first index `i` where either:
1. There is exactly one occurrence of `i` (`cnt[i] == 1`).
2. Two such indices have been found (`t >= 2`).
3. No occurrences of `i` are left (`cnt[i] == 0`).

### Issues Identified
1. **Incorrect Objective**: The program does not simulate the game according to the rules. Instead, it simply counts occurrences and prints the first index meeting certain conditions, which does not reflect the optimal strategy for both players.
2. **No Simulation of Turns**: The program does not alternate between Alice and Bob's turns as required by the game rules.
3. **No Calculation of MEX**: The program does not compute the MEX of the resulting array `c` after the game ends.
4. **No Handling of Multiple Test Cases**: The program reads only one test case at a time and does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the game logic or calculate the optimal MEX value. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
