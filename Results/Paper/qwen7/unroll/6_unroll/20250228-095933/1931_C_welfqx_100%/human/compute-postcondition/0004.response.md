Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of n integers a (where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It then returns information based on these inputs for each test case.**

Note: The actual processing and return values are not detailed here as per the given constraints and output format.
