Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program checks only the second-to-last character of the second row (`b[n - 2]`) to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). This is insufficient because the robot's movement depends on the sequence of arrows, not just the last few cells.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
>>><
><>>
```
In this case, the program would incorrectly output "Yes" because it checks `b[3]` which is `'>'`, but the path `(1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3)` leads to `(2, 3)` instead of `(2, 4)`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to simulate the robot's movement through the grid and check if it can reach the target cell (2, n) based on the sequence of arrows.
