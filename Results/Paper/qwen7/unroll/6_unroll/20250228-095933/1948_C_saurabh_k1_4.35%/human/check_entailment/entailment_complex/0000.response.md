Reasoning:
- The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it only checks the second last character of the second row (`b[n - 2]`) to determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`. This is insufficient because the robot's movement depends on both the current and previous cells' arrows.
- The program should check if the robot can reach the last column `(2, n)` by considering the sequence of movements in both rows.
- The given solution fails to account for the robot's movement pattern and the possibility of reaching the target cell through a combination of left/right moves and arrow directions.

Correctness: **False**
