Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `n` and `m` are integers with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, and `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. The function returns `ans`, which is the number of times `sm` (the sum of elements from list `a` up to the current index) reaches or exceeds `k` based on the conditions provided.**
