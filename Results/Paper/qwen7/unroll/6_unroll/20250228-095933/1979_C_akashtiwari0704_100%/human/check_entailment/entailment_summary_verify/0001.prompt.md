You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Example

Input

    6
    
    3
    
    3 2 7
    
    2
    
    3 3
    
    5
    
    5 5 5 5 5
    
    6
    
    7 9 3 17 9 13
    
    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Program:
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
    
        def lcm(l):
            g = 1
            for i in range(len(l)):
                g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
            return g
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        prod = lcm(a)
        sumo = 0
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `bets`, a list of integers `a`, and calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the list. It then computes a sum based on the LCM and the elements of the list. If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints a space-separated string of integers derived from the LCM and the original list elements. This process is repeated for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a`.

2. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The function `lcm` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the list `a`. This is done using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.
   - The LCM calculation is correct and necessary for determining the required distribution of coins.

3. **Distribution Calculation:**
   - For each outcome, the program calculates the required bet as `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the LCM of all multipliers.
   - It then sums up these bets to check if the total bet is less than or equal to `prod`.

4. **Validation and Output:**
   - If the total bet is greater than or equal to `prod`, the program prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists.
   - Otherwise, it constructs and prints the distribution of bets.

### Verification Against Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `3 3 2 7`
   - LCM of `[3, 2, 7]` is `42`.
   - Bets calculated: `42 // 3 = 14`, `42 // 2 = 21`, `42 // 7 = 6`.
   - Total bet: `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`, which is less than `42`. Hence, the output should be valid.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `2 3 3`
   - LCM of `[3, 3]` is `3`.
   - Bets calculated: `3 // 3 = 1`, `3 // 3 = 1`.
   - Total bet: `1 + 1 = 2`, which is less than `3`. Hence, the output should be valid.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `5 5 5 5 5`
   - LCM of `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]` is `5`.
   - Bets calculated: `5 // 5 = 1` for each outcome.
   - Total bet: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`, which is equal to `5`. Hence, the output should be `-1`.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `6 7 9 3 17 9 13`
   - LCM of `[7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13]` is `18063`.
   - Bets calculated: `18063 // 7 = 2580`, `18063 // 9 = 2007`, `18063 // 3 = 6021`, `18063 // 17 = 1063`, `18063 // 9 = 2007`, `18063 // 13 = 1390`.
   - Total bet: `2580 + 2007 + 6021 + 1063 + 2007 + 1390 = 14068`, which is less than `18063`. Hence, the output should be valid.

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `3 6 3 2`
   - LCM of `[6, 3, 2]` is `6`.
   - Bets calculated: `6 // 6 = 1`, `6 // 3 = 2`, `6 // 2 = 3`.
   - Total bet: `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is equal to `6`. Hence, the output should be `-1`.

6. **Example 6:**
   - Input: `5 9 4 6 8 3`
   - LCM of `[9, 4, 6, 8, 3]` is `72`.
   - Bets calculated: `72 // 9 = 8`, `72 // 4 = 18`, `72 // 6 = 12`, `72 // 8 = 9`, `72 // 3 = 24`.
   - Total bet: `8 + 18 + 12 + 9 + 24 = 61`, which is less than `72`. Hence, the output should be valid.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of bets. It handles all examples provided and ensures the total bet is strictly less than the product of the multipliers for any winning outcome.
