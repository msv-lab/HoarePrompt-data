State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, T is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `T` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.
2. The loop runs for each value of `T` from 0 to `t-1`.
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
4. The initial value of `T` is 0, as it starts counting from 0 up to `t-1`.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `t` (to ensure it is within the valid range) and `T` (which is set to 0 at the start of the loop).
