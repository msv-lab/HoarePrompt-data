Output State: **The output state depends on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop. For each test case (value of `t`), the program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of integers (`a`), then computes a sum (`sumo`) based on the LCM and the elements of the list. If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints a space-separated string of integers derived from the LCM and the original list elements. The process repeats for each test case.**

This description captures the dynamic nature of the output based on user inputs during each iteration of the loop, without specifying exact values since they depend on user input.
