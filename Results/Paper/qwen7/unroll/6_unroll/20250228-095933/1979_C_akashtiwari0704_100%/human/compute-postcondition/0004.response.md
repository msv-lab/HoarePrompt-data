Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `bets`, a list of integers `a`, and calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the list. It then computes a sum based on the LCM and the elements of the list. If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints a space-separated string of integers derived from the LCM and the original list elements. This process is repeated for each test case.**
