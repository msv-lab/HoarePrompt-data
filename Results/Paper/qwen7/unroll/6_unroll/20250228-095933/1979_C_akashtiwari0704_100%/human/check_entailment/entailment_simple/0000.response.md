Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Least Common Multiple Calculation**: The program calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the multipliers using the `lcm` function defined within the `func` function. This is done correctly using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.

3. **Bet Calculation**: For each outcome, the program calculates the bet amount as `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the LCM of all multipliers. This ensures that the total bet amount is evenly divisible by each multiplier.

4. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of the calculated bet amounts is less than the LCM. If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1`, indicating that the distribution of coins cannot satisfy the condition. Otherwise, it prints the bet amounts.

5. **Output Format**: The program outputs the bet amounts as a space-separated string, which matches the required format.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the program appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the LCM, distributes the coins based on the LCM, and checks if the total bet amount is less than the LCM for each outcome.

Correctness: **True**
