Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the first split, `y` is an integer input from the second split, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element. The tree has exactly two leaves; `lst` is a defaultdict(list)**.

Explanation: The code initializes a defaultdict named `lst` with a default factory of `list`. This means that `lst` is now a dictionary where each key maps to a list. The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states. The tree's properties (having exactly two leaves and a single starting node) also remain valid.
