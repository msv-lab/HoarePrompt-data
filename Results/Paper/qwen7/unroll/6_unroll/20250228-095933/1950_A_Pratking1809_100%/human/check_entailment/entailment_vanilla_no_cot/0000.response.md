Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads three digits and checks if they satisfy the conditions for a stair or a peak. The program outputs "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" accordingly, which matches the expected behavior as per the example provided.
