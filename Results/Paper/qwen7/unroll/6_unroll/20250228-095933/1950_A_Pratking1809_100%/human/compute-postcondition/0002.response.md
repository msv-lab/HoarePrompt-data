Output State: The output state will consist of `q` lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions evaluated for each set of inputs `(a, b, c)` provided in the loop. The specific values of 'a', 'b', and 'c' for each iteration determine which string is printed. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and the final state of `q` is the number of iterations completed.
