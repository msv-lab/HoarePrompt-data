Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. Since no other operations are performed on `t`, `n`, `k`, or `nums`, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the only new information is that `ans` is now set to 0.
