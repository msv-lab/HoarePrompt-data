Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The code `nums = deque(nums)` changes the data structure of `nums` from a list to a deque (double-ended queue). However, the values and properties of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain the same as they were in the initial state. The length of the deque `nums` is still `n`, and each element within `nums` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^9.
