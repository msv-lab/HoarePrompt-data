Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required for introverts, extroverts, and universals.
   - Introverts need individual tents.
   - Extroverts need to be in tents with exactly 3 people.
   - Universals can be in any type of tent.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, it checks if adding universals can make the count divisible by 3.
   - If `extroverts % 3` is not zero, and `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it returns `None` indicating it's impossible to form complete groups of 3.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the total number of tents needed.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to form complete groups of 3, so it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` to get the total number of tents.

### Testing the Functions

Let's test the functions with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`
   - `func_1(2, 3)` should return `2` because 2 extroverts and 3 universals can form 2 tents (each tent with 3 people).
   - Total tents: `1 (introvert) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `a = 1`, `b = 4`, `c = 1`
   - `func_1(4, 1)` should return `None` because 4 extroverts cannot form a complete group with 1 universal (since 4 % 3 + 1 < 3).
   - Result: `-1`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `a = 1`, `b = 4`, `c = 2`
   - `func_1(4, 2)` should return `2` because 4 extroverts and 2 universals can form 2 tents (each tent with 3 people).
   - Total tents: `1 (introvert) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3`

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`
   - `func_1(1, 1)` should return `1` because 1 extrovert and 1 universal can form 1 tent (with the introvert).
   - Total tents: `1 (introvert) + 1 (extroverts and universals) = 2` (but since we need at least 1 tent for the introvert, it's `2`).

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `a = 1`, `b = 3`, `c = 2`
   - `func_1(3, 2)` should return `2` because 3 extroverts and 2 universals can form 2 tents (each tent with 3 people).
   - Total tents: `1 (introvert) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3`

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `a = 19`, `b = 7`, `c = 18`
   - `func_1(7, 18)` should return `8` because 7 extroverts and 18 universals can form 8 tents (each tent with 3 people).
   - Total tents: `19 (introverts) + 8 (extroverts and universals) = 27` (but since we need at least 19 tents for introverts, it's `27`).

### Conclusion

The functions seem to correctly handle the logic for calculating the minimum number of tents needed. The implementation appears to be correct based on the provided examples and the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
