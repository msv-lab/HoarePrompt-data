Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of tents required for all participants. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling Introverts and Extroverts Together**: The function `func_2` directly calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` but does not account for the fact that each introvert needs a separate tent. Therefore, the calculation for the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals might be incorrect when there are introverts present.

2. **Calculation Logic for Extroverts and Universals**: The logic in `func_1` assumes that any remaining universals after accommodating extroverts can fill up additional tents. However, this does not consider the possibility that some extroverts might need to be left without a tent if there are not enough universals to pair them up.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The program does not handle edge cases where it's impossible to accommodate everyone, such as when there are more extroverts than pairs of universals available.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to ensure that:
- Each introvert gets a separate tent.
- Extroverts and universals are paired up optimally.
- Check if it's possible to accommodate all extroverts with universals before considering the remaining universals for other purposes.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from math import ceil

def min_tents(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
    # Tents for introverts
    tents_for_introverts = a
    
    # Remaining universals after assigning tents to introverts
    remaining_universals = c - a
    
    # Tents for extroverts
    # Each extrovert needs 2 more people, so we check if we have enough universals
    if b > remaining_universals * 2:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and remaining universals
    tents_for_extroverts_and_universals = ceil((b + remaining_universals) / 3)
    
    # Total tents needed
    total_tents = tents_for_introverts + tents_for_extroverts_and_universals
    
    return total_tents

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().strip().split())
        print(min_tents(a, b, c))
```

This approach ensures that each introvert gets a separate tent and then optimally pairs extroverts with universals, checking for feasibility along the way.
