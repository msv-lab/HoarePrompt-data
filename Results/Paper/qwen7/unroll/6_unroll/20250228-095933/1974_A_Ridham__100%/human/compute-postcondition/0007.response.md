Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on the relationship between \(x\) and \(y\), and appends this value to a list. Finally, it prints each element of the list on a new line. If \(y\) is even, it calculates half of \(y\); if \(y\) is odd, it calculates half of \(y\) plus one. It then determines if the product of \(x\) and 1 is less than or equal to a certain remaining cell count. If so, it appends the calculated value to the list. Otherwise, it calculates the additional screens required and appends this value to the list.**
