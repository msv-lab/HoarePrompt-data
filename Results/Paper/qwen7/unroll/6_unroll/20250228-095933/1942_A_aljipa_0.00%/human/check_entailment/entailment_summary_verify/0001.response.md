### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of its `n` cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program takes an integer `t` as input, indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then generates a result list `res` based on the values of `n` and `k`:
     - If `k == n`, it sets `res` to `[1] * n`, meaning all elements are 1.
     - If `k == 1`, it sets `res` to `range(n)`, meaning the elements are `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
     - Otherwise, it sets `res` to `[-1]`, indicating no valid array can be found.

3. **Checking the Correctness:**
   - **Case 1: `k == n`**
     - If `k == n`, the array `[1] * n` will have all cyclic shifts sorted because all elements are the same.
     - This matches the requirement.
   - **Case 2: `k == 1`**
     - If `k == 1`, the array `range(n)` will have exactly one cyclic shift sorted, which is the original array itself.
     - This also matches the requirement.
   - **Case 3: `k != n` and `k != 1`**
     - If neither `k == n` nor `k == 1`, the program outputs `-1`.
     - This correctly indicates that no valid array can be found.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles all specified cases and outputs the correct results according to the problem statement.

However, the program does not actually generate an array `a` that meets the requirements. Instead, it simply returns predefined lists based on the values of `n` and `k`. This means that the program does not solve the problem as described, but rather provides hardcoded solutions for specific cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not generate an array `a` that meets the requirements for arbitrary values of `n` and `k`. It only provides hardcoded solutions for specific cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
