Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code reads an integer from input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), after executing `t = int(input())`, `t` retains this property but now holds the specific value input by the user. The other conditions and constraints remain valid.
