Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it generates and prints a list based on the values of `n` and `k`. If `k` equals `n`, it prints a list with `n` ones. If `k` equals 1, it prints a list with numbers from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, it prints a list with `-1`.**
