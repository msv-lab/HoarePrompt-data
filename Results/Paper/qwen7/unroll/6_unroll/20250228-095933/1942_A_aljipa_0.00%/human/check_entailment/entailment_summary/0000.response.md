Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by handling specific cases where `k` equals `n` or `k` equals `1`. However, the logic for these conditions is not fully aligned with the problem requirements. Specifically:

1. When `k == n`, the program correctly prints a list of `n` ones, which will always result in all cyclic shifts being sorted.
2. When `k == 1`, the program prints a list of numbers from `0` to `n-1`. This approach might work for some cases but does not guarantee that exactly one cyclic shift will be sorted for all possible values of `n`.

However, the program fails to handle other cases where `1 < k < n`. According to the problem statement, if there is no valid array that satisfies the condition, the program should output `-1`. The current implementation does not cover this scenario adequately.

To correctly implement the solution, the program needs to generate an array that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The provided logic only covers two specific cases and does not address the general case where `1 < k < n`.

Given the current implementation, the program does not fully meet the problem requirements, especially for cases where `1 < k < n`.

Correctness: **False**
