Output State: **`position` is 0, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and n is not equal to 0. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `position` to 0. No other changes are made to the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or any other variables. Therefore, the only updated variable is `position`, which is now 0, while the conditions and values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
