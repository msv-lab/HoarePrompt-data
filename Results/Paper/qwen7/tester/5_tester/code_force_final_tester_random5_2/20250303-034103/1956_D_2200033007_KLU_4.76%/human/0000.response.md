### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a simple, small array where all elements are the same.
**Input**:
```
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
3 0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already optimal, no operations needed.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a simple, small array where all elements are different.
**Input**:
```
3
0 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
3 0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already optimal, no operations needed.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a simple, small array where some elements are the same.
**Input**:
```
3
1 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
4 1
1 3
```
**Explanation**: By setting the entire subarray to the MEX value of the subarray, we can increase the sum.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a larger array where all elements are the same.
**Input**:
```
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
5 0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already optimal, no operations needed.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a larger array where all elements are different.
**Input**:
```
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
10 0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already optimal, no operations needed.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a larger array where some elements are the same.
**Input**:
```
5
1 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
10 1
1 5
```
**Explanation**: By setting the entire subarray to the MEX value of the subarray, we can increase the sum.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an empty array.
**Input**:
```
0
```
**Output**:
```
0 0
```
**Explanation**: An empty array has no elements, so the sum is 0 and no operations are needed.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with a single element.
**Input**:
```
1
0
```
**Output**:
```
1 1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: Setting the single element to 1 increases the sum from 0 to 1.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with a single repeated element.
**Input**:
```
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
1 0
```
**Explanation**: The single element is already at its maximum value, no operations needed.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with all elements being the maximum possible value.
**Input**:
```
5
10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000
```
**Output**:
```
50000000 0
```
**Explanation**: All elements are already at their maximum value, no operations needed.

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with a large number of identical elements.
**Input**:
```
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
10 0
```
**Explanation**: All elements are already at their maximum value, no operations needed.

#### Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with a large number of distinct elements.
**Input**:
```
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**:
```
45 0
```
**Explanation**: All elements are already at their maximum value, no operations needed.

#### Test 13
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with a mix of identical and distinct elements.
**Input**:
```
10
1 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```
**Output**:
```
45 1
1 10
```
**Explanation**: By setting the entire subarray to the MEX value of the subarray, we can increase the sum.
