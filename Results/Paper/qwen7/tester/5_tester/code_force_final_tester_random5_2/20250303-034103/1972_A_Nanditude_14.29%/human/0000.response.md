```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- The first test case matches the example provided in the problem statement. We need to propose two problems with difficulties 800 and 1800 to satisfy the condition \(a_i \leq b_i\) for all \(i\).

```
**Explanation**: 
- The second test case also matches the example provided. We need to propose three problems with difficulties 1, 2, and 3 to satisfy the condition \(a_i \leq b_i\) for all \(i\).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000

```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- In this case, there is only one problem and its difficulty is equal to the expected difficulty. No new problems need to be proposed.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```

**Explanation**: 
- All problem difficulties are less than or equal to the expected difficulties. No new problems need to be proposed.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000 2000 3000
1000 2000 3500
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: 
- We need to propose one problem with difficulty 3500 to satisfy the condition \(a_i \leq b_i\) for all \(i\).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000 2000 3000
1000 2000 3001
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: 
- We need to propose one problem with difficulty 3001 to satisfy the condition \(a_i \leq b_i\) for all \(i\).

# Test 11
