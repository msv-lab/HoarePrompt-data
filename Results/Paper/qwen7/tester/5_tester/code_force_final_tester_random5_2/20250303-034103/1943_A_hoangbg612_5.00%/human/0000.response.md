**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic examples provided in the problem statement.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice can only pick the single element, so the MEX of the resulting array will be 0.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick either 0 or 1. If she picks 0, Bob will pick 1, and the MEX of the resulting array will be 1. If she picks 1, Bob will pick 0, and again the MEX of the resulting array will be 1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick any of the elements. Regardless of her choice, Bob will pick the remaining two elements, and the MEX of the resulting array will be 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick any of the elements. Regardless of her choice, Bob will pick the remaining four elements, and the MEX of the resulting array will be 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick any of the elements. Regardless of her choice, Bob will pick the remaining five elements, and the MEX of the resulting array will be 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
7
0 1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick any of the elements. Regardless of her choice, Bob will pick the remaining six elements, and the MEX of the resulting array will be 1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
8
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick any of the elements. Regardless of her choice, Bob will pick the remaining seven elements, and the MEX of the resulting array will be 1.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
9
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick any of the elements. Regardless of her choice, Bob will pick the remaining eight elements, and the MEX of the resulting array will be 1.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick any of the elements. Regardless of her choice, Bob will pick the remaining nine elements, and the MEX of the resulting array will be 1.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice can only pick the single element, so the MEX of the resulting array will be 0.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick either 1, and Bob will pick the other 1, so the MEX of the resulting array will be 0.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick any of the 1s, and Bob will pick the remaining two 1s, so the MEX of the resulting array will be 0.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick any of the 1s, and Bob will pick the remaining three 1s, so the MEX of the resulting array will be 0.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick any of the 1s, and Bob will pick the remaining four 1s, so the MEX of the resulting array will be 0.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```

6
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick any of the 1s, and Bob will pick the remaining five 1s, so the MEX of the resulting array will be 0.
