To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the simplest case where the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are all different and have no common template.

**Input**:
```
1
1
a
b
c
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: There is no single character template that can satisfy the conditions for `a` and `b` but not for `c`.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the case where `a` and `b` are identical, and `c` is different.

**Input**:
```
1
1
a
a
b
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Since `a` and `b` are identical, any template that matches them will also match `c` unless `c` has a different character.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the case where `a` and `b` are different, and `c` is a mix of characters that can match both `a` and `b` with different templates.

**Input**:
```
1
2
aa
bb
ab
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can use the template "AB" for `a` and `b`, and since `c` is "ab", it does not match the template.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all identical.

**Input**:
```
1
1
a
a
a
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same, there is no template that can differentiate between them.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the case where the length of the strings is 1 and all characters are different.

**Input**:
```
1
1
a
b
c
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Similar to Test 1, no single character template can satisfy the conditions for `a` and `b` but not for `c`.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the case where the length of the strings is 1 and all characters are the same.

**Input**:
```
1
1
a
a
a
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Similar to Test 4, since `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same, there is no template that can differentiate between them.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the case where the length of the strings is 2 and `a` and `b` are identical, and `c` is different.

**Input**:
```
1
2
aa
aa
ab
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Since `a` and `b` are identical, any template that matches them will also match `c` unless `c` has a different character.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the case where the length of the strings is 2 and `a` and `b` are different, and `c` is a mix of characters that can match both `a` and `b` with different templates.

**Input**:
```
1
2
aa
bb
ab
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can use the template "AB" for `a` and `b`, and since `c` is "ab", it does not match the template.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the case where the length of the strings is 2 and all characters are different.

**Input**:
```
1
2
ab
cd
ef
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can use the template "AB" for `a` and `b`, and since `c` is "ef", it does not match the template.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the case where the length of the strings is 2 and all characters are the same.

**Input**:
```
1
2
aa
aa
aa
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same, there is no template that can differentiate between them.

### Additional Test Cases

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the case where the length of the strings is 10 and `a` and `b` are identical, and `c` is different.

**Input**:
```
1
10
mathforces
mathforces
luckforces
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Since `a` and `b` are identical, any template that matches them will also match `c` unless `c` has a different character.

#### Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the case where the length of the strings is 10 and `a` and `b` are different, and `c` is a mix of characters that can match both `a` and `b` with different templates.

**Input**:
```
1
10
mathforces
luckforces
adhoccoder
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can use the template "MATHFORCES" for `a` and "LUCKFORCES" for `b`, and since `c` is "ADHOCCODER", it does not match either template.

#### Test 13
**Objective**: Verify the case where the length of the strings is 10 and all characters are different.

**Input**:
```
1
10
acc
abd
abc
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are all different, there is no single template that can satisfy the conditions for `a` and `b` but not for `c`.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution handles both typical and edge cases effectively.
