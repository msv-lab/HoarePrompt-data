To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
6
WBBWBW
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The minimum length of the segment to be repainted white is 4, covering the segment from the 2nd to the 5th cell.

#### Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
1
B
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The entire strip consists of only one black cell, so painting this single cell is sufficient.

#### Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
2
WB
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The entire strip consists of two cells, where the first is white and the second is black. Painting the second cell is enough.

#### Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
3
BBW
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The minimum length of the segment to be repainted white is 2, covering the segment from the 1st to the 2nd cell.

#### Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
4
BWWB
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The minimum length of the segment to be repainted white is 2, covering the segment from the 1st to the 2nd cell.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
6
BWBWWB
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The minimum length of the segment to be repainted white is 4, covering the segment from the 2nd to the 5th cell.

#### Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
6
WWBBWB
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: All cells except the last two are already white, so painting the last two cells is necessary.

#### Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
9
WBWBWWWBW
```
**Output**:
```
7
```
**Explanation**: The minimum length of the segment to be repainted white is 7, covering the segment from the 2nd to the 8th cell.

#### Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
10
BBBBBBBBBB
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The entire strip consists of only black cells, so painting any single cell is sufficient.

#### Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
10
WWWWWWWWWW
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The entire strip is already white, so no cells need to be repainted.
