To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to consider both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the simplest case where all elements are already the same.
**Input**:
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array is already uniform but has only one element.
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array is uniform but has two elements.
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array is uniform but has three elements.
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array is uniform but has four elements.
**Input**:
```
1
4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has a mix of elements but can be made uniform with one operation.
**Input**:
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
**Output**:
```
4
```

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array is uniform but has a large number of elements.
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 1 1 ... 1 (200000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array is almost uniform but has a single different element.
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has a single element that is different from the rest.
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 5
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has a sequence of identical elements followed by a different element.
**Input**:
```
1
6
1 1 1 2 2 2
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has a sequence of identical elements followed by a different element, and then another sequence of identical elements.
**Input**:
```
1
8
1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

#### Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has multiple sequences of identical elements.
**Input**:
```
1
8
1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

#### Test 13
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has a large number of elements and needs multiple operations to make all elements uniform.
**Input**:
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
45
```

#### Test 14
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has a large number of elements and needs multiple operations to make all elements uniform, with the largest possible cost.
**Input**:
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
45
```

#### Test 15
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has a large number of elements and needs multiple operations to make all elements uniform, with the smallest possible cost.
**Input**:
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
