# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
43
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: There is only one container, so it is trivially possible to make the amount of water the same.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The container already has zero water, so no operations are needed.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of the elements is 4, which is not divisible by 2, making it impossible to equalize the water.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The sum of the elements is 15, which is divisible by 5. Equalizing the water is possible as shown in the problem note.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The sum of the elements is 6, which is divisible by 3. Equalizing the water is possible as each container already has the same amount of water.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of the elements is 28, which is divisible by 7. However, the distribution cannot be made uniform without violating the condition \(i < j\).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of the elements is 30, which is divisible by 7. However, the distribution cannot be made uniform without violating the condition \(i < j\).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Both containers have zero water, so no operations are needed.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Both containers have the same amount of water, so no operations are needed.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have the same amount of water, so no operations are needed.

# Test 11

```
1
10
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers have zero water, so no operations are needed.

**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of the elements is 55, which is divisible by 10. However, the distribution cannot be made uniform without violating the condition \(i < j\).

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have the same amount of water, so no operations are needed.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of the elements is 55, which is divisible by 10. However, the distribution cannot be made uniform without violating the condition \(i < j\).

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of the elements is 1, which is divisible by 10. However, the distribution cannot be made uniform without violating the condition \(i < j\).

# Test 16
