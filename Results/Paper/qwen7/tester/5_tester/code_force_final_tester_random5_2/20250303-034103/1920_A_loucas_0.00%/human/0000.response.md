# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: k must be greater than or equal to 3, less than or equal to 10, not equal to 1, and not equal to 5. The valid values for k are 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 5
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: k must be greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to 4, which is impossible. Hence, there are no valid values for k.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10
3 6
3 7
1 2
1 7
3 100
3 44
2 100
2 98
1 3
3 99
```
**Output**: 
```
90
```
**Explanation**: k must not be 6, 7, 2, 7, 100, 44, 100, 98, 3, and 99. The remaining valid range is from 4 to 98, inclusive, giving us 95 - 5 = 90 valid values.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
10
3 6
3 7
1 2
1 7
3 100
3 44
2 100
2 98
1 3
3 99
```
**Output**: 
```
90
```
**Explanation**: This is a duplicate of Test 3, but included to ensure consistency in the solution.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10
3 6
3 7
1 2
1 7
3 100
3 44
2 100
2 98
1 3
3 99
```
**Output**: 
```
90
```
**Explanation**: Same as Test 3 and Test 4.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10
3 6
3 7
1 2
1 7
3 100
3 44
2 100
2 98
1 3
3 99
```
**Output**: 
```
90
```
**Explanation**: Same as Test 3, Test 4, and Test 5.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 5
2 4
1 9
2 2
3 2
3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: k must be greater than or equal to 5, less than or equal to 4, greater than or equal to 9, and less than or equal to 2. There is no value of k that satisfies all these conditions simultaneously.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 10000
2 900000000
3 500000000
1 100000000
3 10000
3 900000001
```
**Output**: 
```
800000000
```
**Explanation**: k must be greater than or equal to 10000, less than or equal to 900000000, not equal to 500000000, not equal to 100000000, and not equal to 900000001. The valid range is from 10001 to 899999999, inclusive, minus the excluded values, resulting in 800000000 valid values.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1
2 2
3 1
3 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: k must be greater than or equal to 1, less than or equal to 2, not equal to 1, not equal to 2, and not equal to 3. There is no value of k that satisfies all these conditions simultaneously.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 10000
2 900000000
3 500000000
1 100000000
3 10000
3 900000001
```
**Output**: 
```
800000000
```
**Explanation**: This is a duplicate of Test 8, ensuring consistency in the solution.
