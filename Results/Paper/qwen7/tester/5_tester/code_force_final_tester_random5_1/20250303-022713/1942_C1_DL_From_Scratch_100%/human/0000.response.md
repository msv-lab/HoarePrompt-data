To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Input**:
```
3
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
8 8 0
1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
4 2 0
1 3

**Output**:
```
2
6
2
```

#### Explanation:
- **Test 1**: For an 8-sided polygon with vertices 1, 6, 2, and 5 chosen, no additional vertices can be chosen (y = 0). The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 2.
- **Test 2**: For an 8-sided polygon with all vertices chosen, no additional vertices can be chosen (y = 0). The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 6.
- **Test 3**: For a 4-sided polygon with vertices 1 and 3 chosen, no additional vertices can be chosen (y = 0). The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 2.
