# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
**Explanation**: There are 7 sticks, and any combination of 3 sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle because all sticks have the same length \(2^1 = 2\). The number of ways to choose 3 sticks out of 7 is given by the combination formula \(C(7, 3) = \frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = 35\).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: There are 4 sticks with lengths \(2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^3\). The only valid combinations to form a non-degenerate triangle are (3, 2, 1) and (3, 3, 1), but since the order does not matter, we count (1, 2, 3) and (1, 3, 3) as the same. Thus, there are 2 unique ways to form a triangle.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are 3 sticks with lengths \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3\). No combination of these lengths can form a non-degenerate triangle because the triangle inequality theorem is not satisfied for any combination of these lengths.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only 1 stick, and we need to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a triangle, which is impossible.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
20
0
```
**Explanation**: For the first test case, the lengths are \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5\). We can form triangles with combinations like (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 5), (0, 2, 3), (0, 2, 4), (0, 2, 5), (0, 3, 4), (0, 3, 5), (0, 4, 5), (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 5), (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 5), (1, 4, 5), (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 5), (2, 4, 5), (3, 4, 5). This gives us 20 combinations. For the second test case, the lengths are \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3\), and no combination can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
8
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**: 
```
56
```
**Explanation**: With 8 sticks having lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7\), we can form triangles in many ways. Using the combination formula, the number of ways to choose 3 sticks out of 8 is \(C(8, 3) = \frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = 56\).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are 2 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^0\). No combination of these lengths can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: There are 5 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^1, 2^1, 2^2\). The valid combinations are (0, 1, 1), (0, 1, 1), (0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1). Since the order does not matter, we count (0, 1, 1) as the only unique way, giving us 3 unique ways to form a triangle.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All three sticks have the same length \(2^0\), and no combination of these lengths can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
120
```
**Explanation**: With 10 sticks having lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8, 2^9\), the number of ways to choose 3 sticks out of 10 is \(C(10, 3) = \frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = 120\).
