# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
11
0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
abracadabra
```
**Explanation**: This is a basic test case where the length of the string is 11 and the trace matches the example provided in the problem statement.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
codeforces
```
**Explanation**: This is another basic test case with a string length of 10, and the trace is different from the previous one but still valid.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
a
```
**Explanation**: This is an edge case where the string length is 1, and the only possible string is a single 'a'.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
8
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Explanation**: This is an edge case where the trace indicates that each character appears in increasing order, suggesting the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" if we were to extend it to more than 26 characters. However, since the problem specifies lowercase Latin letters a-z, the string wraps around, resulting in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
8
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
aaaaaaab
```
**Explanation**: This is an edge case where no previous character matches the current character, indicating that the string consists of the same character repeated.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2
1
0
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
a
a
```
**Explanation**: This is a basic test case with two test cases of length 1, both resulting in the string 'a'.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
aaaaaaaaaa
```
**Explanation**: This is an edge case where the string is composed entirely of the same character, as indicated by the trace.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
11
0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
abracadabra
```
**Explanation**: This is a duplicate of Test 1 to ensure consistency in the function's behavior.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
codeforces
```
**Explanation**: This is a duplicate of Test 2 to ensure consistency in the function's behavior.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
a
```
**Explanation**: This is a duplicate of Test 3 to ensure consistency in the function's behavior.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
8
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Explanation**: This is a duplicate of Test 4 to ensure consistency in the function's behavior.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
8
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
aaaaaaab
```
**Explanation**: This is a duplicate of Test 5 to ensure consistency in the function's behavior.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
2
1
0
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
a
a
```
**Explanation**: This is a duplicate of Test 6 to ensure consistency in the function's behavior.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
aaaaaaaaaa
```
**Explanation**: This is a duplicate of Test 7 to ensure consistency in the function's behavior.
