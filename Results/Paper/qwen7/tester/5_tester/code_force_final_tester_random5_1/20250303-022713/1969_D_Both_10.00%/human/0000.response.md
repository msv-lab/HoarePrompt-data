# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0
2 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice should buy the 2-nd item and sell it to Bob, so her profit is 2 - 1 = 1.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
1 2 1 4
3 3 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice should buy the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd items; then Bob takes the 1-st item for free and pays for the 2-nd and 3-rd items. Alice's profit is (3 + 2) - (1 + 2 + 1) = 1. Bob won't take the 3-rd item for free since this would not change Alice's profit.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
2 1 1 1
4 2 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice should buy the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd items; then Bob takes 2 items (the 1-st and 2-nd) for free and pays for the 3-rd and 4-th items. Alice's profit is (2 + 3) - (1 + 1 + 1 + 2) = 0. Bob will take the 1-st and 2-nd items for free because taking the 3-rd and 4-th items would not change Alice's profit.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
1 3 4 9 1 3
7 6 8 10 6 8
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: Alice should buy the 1-st, 2-nd, 3-rd, 5-th, and 6-th items; then Bob takes 2 items (the 1-st and 2-nd) for free and pays for the 3-rd, 4-th, 5-th, and 6-th items. Alice's profit is (8 + 10 + 6 + 8) - (1 + 3 + 4 + 9 + 1 + 3) = 7. Bob will take the 1-st and 2-nd items for free because taking the 3-rd, 4-th, 5-th, and 6-th items would not change Alice's profit.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice should buy the only item and sell it to Bob, so her profit is 1 - 1 = 0. However, since the condition is "less than k" and k is 0, Alice can sell the item without any restriction, so her profit is 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice should buy the only item and sell it to Bob, so her profit is 1 - 1 = 0. Since k is 1, Bob will take the item for free, so Alice's profit is 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice should buy both items and sell them to Bob. Since k is 1, Bob will take one item for free, so Alice's profit is 1 + 1 - (1 + 1) = 0.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
1 2 3
4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice should buy all three items and sell them to Bob. Since k is 3, Bob will take all three items for free, so Alice's profit is 4 + 5 + 6 - (1 + 2 + 3) = 0.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2
1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
12
```
**Explanation**: Alice should buy all five items and sell them to Bob. Since k is 2, Bob will take 2 items for free, so Alice's profit is (6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10) - (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) = 12.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
10
10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice should buy the only item and sell it to Bob. Since k is 0, Alice can sell the item without any restriction, but Bob will take the item for free, so Alice's profit is 0.
