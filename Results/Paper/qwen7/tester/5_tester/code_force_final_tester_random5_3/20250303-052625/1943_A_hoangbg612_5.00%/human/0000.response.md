```
1
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Ten elements in the array. Alice will pick 0, Bob will pick 1, Alice will pick 2, Bob will pick 3, Alice will pick 4, Bob will pick 5, Alice will pick 6, Bob will pick 7, Alice will pick 8, and Bob will pick 9. The resulting array is [9], and the MEX is 0.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Single element, Alice will pick it, resulting in an empty array for Bob, and the MEX of an empty array is 0.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice will pick 1, resulting in [0], and the MEX is 1, but since Bob picks 0 next, the MEX becomes 0.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 0 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice will pick 1, resulting in [0, 2], and the MEX is 1, but since Bob picks 0 next, the MEX becomes 0, and Alice picks 2, resulting in [2], and the MEX is 0.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 0 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice will pick 1, resulting in [0, 2, 3], and the MEX is 1, but since Bob picks 0 next, the MEX becomes 0, and Alice picks 2, resulting in [2, 3], and the MEX is 0, and finally, Bob picks 3, resulting in [3], and the MEX is 0.

# Test 15
