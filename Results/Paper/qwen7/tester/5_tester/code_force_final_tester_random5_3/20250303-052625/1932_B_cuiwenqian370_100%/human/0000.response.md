# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```
**Output**: 
```
36
```
**Explanation**: This is the basic scenario provided in the example. It tests the core functionality of the algorithm.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This scenario tests the case where the periodicities are consecutive integers, ensuring the algorithm handles sequential increments correctly.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where all signs occur every year. The output should be the sum of the periodicities minus one, which is 5 in this case.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```
**Output**: 
```
2012
```
**Explanation**: This is another basic scenario provided in the example. It ensures the algorithm can handle larger numbers and multiple periodicities.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
**Explanation**: This tests the edge case where there is only one sign with a very large periodicity. The output should be equal to the periodicity itself.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This tests the case with two signs, ensuring the algorithm correctly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the two periodicities.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where all signs have the same periodicity. The output should be the periodicity plus one, as the first sign occurs in the first year, and subsequent signs occur in the next years.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 3 6
```
**Output**: 
```
12
```
**Explanation**: This tests the case where the periodicities have a common factor. The output should be the LCM of the periodicities, which is 12 in this case.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
4 6 9
```
**Output**: 
```
36
```
**Explanation**: This tests the case where the periodicities do not share a common factor other than 1. The output should be the LCM of the periodicities, which is 36 in this case.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
2520
```
**Explanation**: This tests the case with multiple periodicities, ensuring the algorithm can handle the LCM calculation for a larger set of numbers.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: This tests the case where all periodicities are the same. The output should be the periodicity itself, as the LCM of identical numbers is the number itself.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This tests the case with a single sign occurring every year. The output should be 2, as the first sign occurs in the first year, and the next year is considered.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This tests the case with two signs both occurring every year. The output should be 2, as the first sign occurs in the first year, and the second sign occurs in the second year.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: This tests the case where the periodicities are small and cover a range of values. The output should be the LCM of 1, 2, and 3, which is 6.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
4
2 3 5 7
```
**Output**: 
```
210
```
**Explanation**: This tests the case where the periodicities are prime numbers. The output should be the product of these primes, as they do not share any common factors other than 1.
