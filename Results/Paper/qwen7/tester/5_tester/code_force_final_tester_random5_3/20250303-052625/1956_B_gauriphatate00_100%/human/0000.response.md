# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: This is a basic test case where the number of cards is 4, and the player has two cards with the number 1, one card with the number 2, and one card with the number 3. Given that Nene will play optimally to minimize the player's score, the best strategy for the player is to play one of the cards with the number 1, scoring 1 point.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
8
7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: In this case, the player has two cards with the number 7, one card each with the numbers 4, 1, 2, 8, 5. Nene will play optimally to minimize the player's score. The player can achieve a maximum of 2 points by playing one of the cards with the number 7 and one of the cards with the number 5.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
8
7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Here, the player has one card each with the numbers 7, 1, 4, 5, 3, 2, and one card with the number 6. Nene will play optimally to minimize the player's score. The player can achieve a maximum of 1 point by playing one of the cards with the number 4 or 5.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: With three cards numbered 1, 2, and 3, Nene will play optimally to minimize the player's score. Since Nene can play optimally to prevent the player from scoring any points, the player's maximum score is 0.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: In this case, the player has only one card with the number 1. Nene will play optimally to minimize the player's score. Since Nene can play optimally to prevent the player from scoring any points, the player's maximum score is 0.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2
1
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
```
*Explanation*: Here, the player has one card with the number 1 in each of the two test cases. Nene will play optimally to minimize the player's score. Since Nene can play optimally to prevent the player from scoring any points, the player's maximum score is 0 in both test cases.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: With two cards numbered 2 and 1, Nene will play optimally to minimize the player's score. The player can achieve a maximum of 1 point by playing one of the cards with the number 1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Here, the player has two cards with the number 1. Nene will play optimally to minimize the player's score. The player can achieve a maximum of 1 point by playing one of the cards with the number 1.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: With two cards numbered 2, Nene will play optimally to minimize the player's score. Since Nene can play optimally to prevent the player from scoring any points, the player's maximum score is 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: With one card each with the numbers 1 and 2, Nene will play optimally to minimize the player's score. The player can achieve a maximum of 1 point by playing one of the cards with the number 1.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: With ten distinct cards numbered from 1 to 10, Nene will play optimally to minimize the player's score. Since Nene can play optimally to prevent the player from scoring any points, the player's maximum score is 0.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: With five pairs of cards numbered from 1 to 5, Nene will play optimally to minimize the player's score. The player can achieve a maximum of 5 points by playing one card from each pair.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: With nine cards numbered from 1 to 9, one of which is a duplicate, Nene will play optimally to minimize the player's score. The player can achieve a maximum of 4 points by playing four unique cards.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: With five pairs of cards, one of which has a missing pair, Nene will play optimally to minimize the player's score. The player can achieve a maximum of 3 points by playing three unique cards.
