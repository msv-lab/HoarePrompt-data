# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
43
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: There is only one container, so it is trivially possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Even though there is no water, the condition is still satisfied since there is only one container.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The two containers cannot be made to have the same amount of water.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The total water is 15, which is divisible by 5. We can pour water between containers to make them equal.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The total water is 6, which is divisible by 3. We can pour water between containers to make them equal.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total water is 28, which is divisible by 7, but the distribution cannot be made uniform through the allowed operations.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total water is 28, which is divisible by 7, but the distribution cannot be made uniform through the allowed operations.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The total water is 2 billion, which is divisible by 2. Both containers can be made to have 1 billion units of water.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Both containers have no water, so they are already equal.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: All containers already have the same amount of water.

**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total water is 55, which is divisible by 10, but the distribution cannot be made uniform through the allowed operations.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3
10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: All containers already have the same amount of water.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: All containers have no water, so they are already equal.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total water is 1, which is divisible by 3, but the distribution cannot be made uniform through the allowed operations.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Both containers have 1 billion units of water, so they are already equal.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES

1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total water is 15, which is divisible by 5, but the distribution cannot be made uniform through the allowed operations.
