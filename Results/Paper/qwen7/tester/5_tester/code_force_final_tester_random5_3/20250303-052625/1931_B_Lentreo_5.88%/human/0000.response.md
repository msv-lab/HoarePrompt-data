# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
43
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: There is only one container, so it is trivially possible to make the amount of water the same (itself).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: There is only one container with zero water, which is also trivially possible.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: There are two containers with different amounts of water, making it impossible to equalize them.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The total water is 15, and dividing by 5 gives 3 units per container. We can achieve this by pouring water between containers.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The total water is 6, and dividing by 3 gives 2 units per container. We can achieve this by pouring water between containers.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The total water is 28, and dividing by 7 gives 4 units per container. However, there are no intermediate steps to achieve this without violating the condition \(i < j\).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The total water is 28, and dividing by 7 gives 4 units per container. Similar to the previous case, there are no valid operations to achieve this.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: There is only one container with zero water, making it trivially possible.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Both containers have the same amount of water, so no operations are needed.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000000000 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The total water is 1000000000, and dividing by 3 gives approximately 333333333.33 units per container, which cannot be achieved through the given operations.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have the same amount of water, so no operations are needed.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The total water is 15, and dividing by 5 gives 3 units per container. However, achieving this requires operations that violate the condition \(i < j\).

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers have zero water, making it trivially possible.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers have the same amount of water, so no operations are needed.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The total water is 55, and dividing by 10 gives 5.5 units per container, which cannot be achieved through the given operations.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic and edge cases, ensuring the solution's robustness and reliability.
