1
1000000
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
1
```
*Explanation*: Two separate test cases with different inputs. The first case has a single sign with a large periodicity, and the second case has a single sign with a small periodicity.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
*Explanation*: The nth sign occurs in the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is 55 for n=10.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
*Explanation*: All signs have the same periodicity, so the nth sign occurs in 10*n years.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: All signs occur every year, so the nth sign occurs in the nth year.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
10000000
```
*Explanation*: All signs have the same large periodicity, so the nth sign occurs in 1000000*n years.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
