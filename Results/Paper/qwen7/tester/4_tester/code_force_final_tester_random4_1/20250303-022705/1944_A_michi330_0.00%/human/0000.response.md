# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: No bridges can be destroyed, so all islands are reachable.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: One bridge can be destroyed, and destroying the bridge between islands 1 and 2 prevents Everule from visiting island 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: With one bridge, it's impossible to isolate any island completely. Therefore, all islands remain reachable.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: All bridges can be destroyed, leaving only island 1 reachable.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: Destroying 3 bridges cannot isolate all islands, but it can reduce the number of reachable islands. In this case, it's optimal to destroy bridges in such a way that minimizes the number of reachable islands, which is 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Destroying 4 bridges out of 6 leaves only island 1 reachable.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
3 0
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
2
```
*Explanation*: In the first subcase, no bridges can be destroyed, so all islands are reachable. In the second subcase, one bridge can be destroyed, preventing Everule from visiting one of the islands.

# Test 8

6 0
6 5
```
**Output**: 
```
6
1
```
*Explanation*: In the first subcase, no bridges can be destroyed, so all islands are reachable. In the second subcase, five bridges can be destroyed, isolating all islands except island 1.

# Test 9

1 0
1 1
10 9
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
1
```
*Explanation*: In the first subcase, there is only one island, so no bridges can be destroyed. In the second subcase, one bridge can be destroyed, but it doesn't affect the single island. In the third subcase, nine bridges can be destroyed, leaving only island 1 reachable.

1
```
*Explanation*: In the first subcase, 44 bridges can be destroyed, leaving only island 1 reachable. In the second subcase, all bridges can be destroyed, leaving only island 1 reachable. In the third subcase, all bridges can be destroyed, leaving only island 1 reachable.

# Test 12
**Input**:
