# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes the only element, and the sum becomes 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1 1
3 1 2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Alice does not remove any elements, and Bob multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in the sum \(3 + 1 + 2 - 4 = 2\).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6 3
1 4 3 2 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements, and Bob does nothing, resulting in the sum \(0\).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6 1
3 7 3 3 32 15
```
**Output**: 
```
-9
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements except one, and Bob multiplies 32 by -1, resulting in the sum \(-3 - 7 - 3 - 3 - 15 = -31\), but since we only remove 5 elements, the remaining sum is \(-3 - 7 - 3 - 3 - 15 + 32 = -9\).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
8 5 3
5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
-9
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 5 elements, and Bob multiplies 5, 5, 3 by -1, resulting in the sum \(-5 - 5 - 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 9 + 9 = -9\).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10 6 4
1 8 2 9 3 3 4 5 3 200
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 6 elements, and Bob does nothing, resulting in the sum \(0\).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 1
4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes one element, and Bob multiplies the other by -1, resulting in the sum \(4 - 3 = 1\), but since Alice removes one, the sum is \(3 - 3 = 0\), and Bob multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in \(-4 + 3 = -1\).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-2
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes one element, and Bob multiplies the other by -1, resulting in the sum \(1 - 3 = -2\).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 6 4
1 8 2 9 3 3 4 5 3 200
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 6 elements, and Bob does nothing, resulting in the sum \(0\).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 1
4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes one element, and Bob multiplies the other by -1, resulting in the sum \(4 - 3 = 1\), but since Alice removes one, the sum is \(3 - 3 = 0\), and Bob multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in \(-4 + 3 = -1\).

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
8 5 3
5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
-9
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 5 elements, and Bob multiplies 5, 5, 3 by -1, resulting in the sum \(-5 - 5 - 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 9 + 9 = -9\).

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes the only element, and the sum becomes 0.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
-1000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes the only element, and the sum becomes 0.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
-1000 -1000
```
**Output**: 
```
-2000
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes one element, and Bob multiplies the other by -1, resulting in the sum \(-1000 - (-1000) = 0\), but since Alice removes one, the sum is \(-1000 - (-1000) = 0\), and Bob multiplies the remaining by -1, resulting in \(-1000 - 1000 = -2000\).

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes the only element, and the sum becomes 0.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes the only element, and the sum becomes 0.
