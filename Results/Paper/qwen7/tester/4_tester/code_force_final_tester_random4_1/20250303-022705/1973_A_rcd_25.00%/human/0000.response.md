To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here is a detailed set of test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the case where no games were played.
**Input**:
```
0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No games were played, so no draws could occur.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the case where one game was played, resulting in a draw.
**Input**:
```
0 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: One game was played between the second and third players, resulting in a draw.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the case where the scores are equal and represent a single game with a winner.
**Input**:
```
1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The scores cannot be achieved with valid games since the scores must be non-decreasing and the only way to achieve 1-1-1 would require a draw, which contradicts the non-decreasing order.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the case where the scores are 1-1-2, representing two games with one win and one draw.
**Input**:
```
1 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Two games were played: one game resulted in a win for the third player, and the other game resulted in a draw.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the case where the scores are equal and represent multiple games with draws.
**Input**:
```
3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The scores cannot be achieved with valid games since the scores must be non-decreasing and the only way to achieve 3-3-3 would require multiple wins and draws, which contradicts the non-decreasing order.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the case where the scores are 3-4-5, representing multiple games with one win and multiple draws.
**Input**:
```
3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: Six games were played: three games resulted in a win for the third player, and three games resulted in draws.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the case where the scores are 1-1-10, representing multiple games with one win and many draws.
**Input**:
```
1 1 10
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Two games were played: one game resulted in a win for the third player, and nine games resulted in draws.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the case where the scores are all zeros and represent no games.
**Input**:
```
0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No games were played, so no draws could occur.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the case where the scores are 0-1-1 and represent one draw.
**Input**:
```
0 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: One game was played between the second and third players, resulting in a draw.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the case where the scores are 1-1-1 and represent an impossible scenario.
**Input**:
```
1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The scores cannot be achieved with valid games since the scores must be non-decreasing and the only way to achieve 1-1-1 would require a draw, which contradicts the non-decreasing order.

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the case where the scores are 1-1-2 and represent two games with one win and one draw.
**Input**:
```
1 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Two games were played: one game resulted in a win for the third player, and the other game resulted in a draw.

#### Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the case where the scores are 3-3-3 and represent an impossible scenario.
**Input**:
```
3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The scores cannot be achieved with valid games since the scores must be non-decreasing and the only way to achieve 3-3-3 would require multiple wins and draws, which contradicts the non-decreasing order.

#### Test 13
**Objective**: Verify the case where the scores are 3-4-5 and represent six games with one win and five draws.
**Input**:
```
3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: Six games were played: three games resulted in a win for the third player, and three games resulted in draws.

#### Test 14
**Objective**: Verify the case where the scores are 1-1-10 and represent two games with one win and eight draws.
**Input**:
```
1 1 10
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Two games were played: one game resulted in a win for the third player, and nine games resulted in draws.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
