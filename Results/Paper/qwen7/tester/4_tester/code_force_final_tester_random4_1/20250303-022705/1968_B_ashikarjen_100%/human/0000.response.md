# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4
10011
1110
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The first 2 characters of '10011' (i.e., '10') form a subsequence of '1110'. The next character '0' does not form a subsequence, so the maximum k is 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
100
110
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The first 2 characters of '100' (i.e., '10') form a subsequence of '110'. The next character '0' does not form a subsequence, so the maximum k is 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1 3
1
111
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The first 1 character of '1' (i.e., '1') forms a subsequence of '111'. The next character does not exist in '111', so the maximum k is 1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
1011
1111
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The first 1 character of '1011' (i.e., '1') forms a subsequence of '1111'. The next characters do not form a subsequence, so the maximum k is 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5
100
11010
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The first 3 characters of '100' (i.e., '100') form a subsequence of '11010'. The next character does not exist in '11010', so the maximum k is 3.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
100
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The binary string '100' cannot form any subsequence of '0', so the maximum k is 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1
1
1
1 1
0
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
*Explanation*: In the first test case, both strings are identical, so the maximum k is 1. In the second test case, the strings are different, so no characters form a subsequence, hence the maximum k is 0.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
2 2
01
01
2 2
10
01
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1
```
*Explanation*: In the first test case, both strings are identical, so the maximum k is 2. In the second test case, the first character '1' forms a subsequence, but the second character '0' does not, so the maximum k is 1.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
5 10
10011
1111100110
5 10
00000
0010110100
```
**Output**: 
```
5
0
```
*Explanation*: In the first test case, the entire string '10011' forms a subsequence of '1111100110', so the maximum k is 5. In the second test case, none of the characters in '00000' form a subsequence of '0010110100', so the maximum k is 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
00
11
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Neither of the characters in '00' form a subsequence of '11', so the maximum k is 0.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
1010101010
0101010101
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: The entire string '1010101010' forms a subsequence of '0101010101', so the maximum k is 10.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The string '1' cannot form a subsequence of '0', so the maximum k is 0.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
1010101010
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The first character '1' forms a subsequence of '1', so the maximum k is 1.
