# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10
1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: We can buy up to 10 cards of any type. Since we only have one type of card initially, we can buy 10 more cards of type 1, resulting in an array of 11 ones. This array has 11 subarrays of length 1, which are permutations of [1]. Hence, the score is 11.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 4
8 4
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
*Explanation*: We can buy up to 4 cards of any type. Initially, we have 8 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2. By buying 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2, we can rearrange the cards as [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]. This arrangement results in 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays equal to [2, 1], totaling 15 subarrays which are permutations of [1, 2].

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4
6 1 8
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
*Explanation*: We can buy up to 4 cards of any type. Initially, we have 6 cards of type 1, 1 card of type 2, and 8 cards of type 3. By buying 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2, we can rearrange the cards as [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]. This arrangement results in 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays equal to [2, 1], totaling 15 subarrays which are permutations of [1, 2].

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
22
```
*Explanation*: We can buy up to 9 cards of any type. Initially, we have 7 cards of type 1, 6 cards of type 2, and 2 cards of type 3. By buying 2 cards of type 3, we can rearrange the cards as [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]. This arrangement results in 10 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 12 subarrays equal to [2, 1], totaling 22 subarrays which are permutations of [1, 2].

# Test 5

**Output**: 
```
28
```
*Explanation*: We can buy up to 3 cards of any type. Initially, we have 6 cards of type 1, 6 cards of type 2, 7 cards of type 3, 4 cards of type 4, and 6 cards of type 5. By buying 1 card of type 4 and 2 cards of type 5, we can rearrange the cards as [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 5]. This arrangement results in 10 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 18 subarrays equal to [2, 1], totaling 28 subarrays which are permutations of [1, 2].

*Explanation*: We can buy up to 7 cards of any type. Initially, we have 7 cards of type 1, 6 cards of type 2, 1 card of type 3, 7 cards of type 4, 6 cards of type 5, 2 cards of type 6, 4 cards of type 7, 3 cards of type 8, and 3 cards of type 9. By buying 2 cards of type 3, 1 card of type 6, and 4 cards of type 9, we can rearrange the cards as [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3,
