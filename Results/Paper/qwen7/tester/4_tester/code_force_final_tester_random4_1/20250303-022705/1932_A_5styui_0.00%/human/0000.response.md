To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Input**:
```
3
10
.@@*@.**@@
5
.@@@@
15
.@@..@***..@@@*
```
**Output**:
```
3
4
3
```

#### Explanation:
- **Test 1**: The path has 10 cells. The sequence `.@@*@.**@@` allows collecting 3 coins.
- **Test 2**: The path has 5 cells. The sequence `.@@@@` allows collecting 4 coins.
- **Test 3**: The path has 15 cells. The sequence `.@@..@***..@@@*` allows collecting 3 coins.

#### Test 2
**Input**:
```
3
1
.
2
..
3
.@
```
**Output**:
```
0
0
1
```

#### Explanation:
- **Test 2**: The path has 1 cell. Since it is empty, no coins can be collected.
- **Test 3**: The path has 2 cells. Both cells are empty, so no coins can be collected.
- **Test 4**: The path has 3 cells. Only the second cell contains a coin, so 1 coin can be collected.

#### Test 3
**Input**:
```
3
10
.*@*.*@*.**
5
.*@.*
15
.*@.*.*@*.**
```
**Output**:
```
2
1
2
```

#### Explanation:
- **Test 5**: The path has 10 cells. The sequence `.*@*.*@*.**` allows collecting 2 coins.
- **Test 6**: The path has 5 cells. The sequence `.*@.*` allows collecting 1 coin.
- **Test 7**: The path has 15 cells. The sequence `.*@.*.*@*.**` allows collecting 2 coins.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1
.
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Explanation:
- **Test 8**: The path has 1 cell, which is empty. No coins can be collected.

#### Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
10
**********
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Explanation:
- **Test 9**: The path has 10 cells, all of which are thorns. No coins can be collected.

#### Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
10
.@@@.*@.*@
```
**Output**:
```
3
```

#### Explanation:
- **Test 10**: The path has 10 cells. The sequence `.@@@.*@.*@` allows collecting 3 coins.

#### Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
10
.**.*@.*@.*
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

#### Explanation:
- **Test 11**: The path has 10 cells. The sequence `.**.*@.*@.*` allows collecting 2 coins.

#### Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
10
.*@.*@.*@.*
```
**Output**:
```
3
```

#### Explanation:
- **Test 12**: The path has 10 cells. The sequence `.*@.*@.*@.*` allows collecting 3 coins.

#### Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
10
.*@.*@.*@.*@
```
**Output**:
```
4
```

#### Explanation:
- **Test 13**: The path has 10 cells. The sequence `.*@.*@.*@.*@` allows collecting 4 coins.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution handles both typical and edge cases effectively.
