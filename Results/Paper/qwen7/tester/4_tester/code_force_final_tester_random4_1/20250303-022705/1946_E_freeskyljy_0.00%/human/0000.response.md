# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There is only one permutation of length 1, which is [1]. Since both the prefix and suffix maximums are at index 1, there is only one valid permutation.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 3
1 2
2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix maximums are at positions 1 and 2, and the indices of the suffix maximums are at positions 2, 3, and 4. The possible permutations are [1, 4, 3, 2], [2, 4, 3, 1], and [3, 4, 2, 1].

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 1
1 2 3
3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix maximums are at positions 1, 2, and 3, and the index of the suffix maximum is at position 3. The only valid permutation is [1, 2, 3].

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3 4
1 2 3
2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix maximums are at positions 1, 2, and 3, and the indices of the suffix maximums are at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5. No permutation satisfies both conditions simultaneously.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
20 5 4
1 2 3 4 12
12 13 18 20
```
**Output**: 
```
317580808
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix maximums are at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 12, and the indices of the suffix maximums are at positions 12, 13, 18, and 20. The number of valid permutations is calculated modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2 3
1 3
3 4 6
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix maximums are at positions 1 and 3, and the indices of the suffix maximums are at positions 3, 4, and 6. The valid permutations are [2, 1, 6, 5, 3, 4], [3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4], [3, 2, 6, 5, 1, 4], [4, 1, 6, 5, 2, 3], [4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 3], [4, 3, 6, 5, 1, 2], [5, 1, 6, 4, 2, 3], [5, 2, 6, 4, 1, 3], [5, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], and [5, 4, 6, 3, 1, 2].

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This is a duplicate of Test 1, but included to ensure consistency.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 4
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix and suffix maximums are the same, meaning the permutation must be [1, 2, 3, 4], but this does not satisfy the condition of having distinct indices for prefix and suffix maximums.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1 1
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The index of the prefix maximum is at position 1, and the index of the suffix maximum is at position 10. The only valid permutation is [10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2
1 2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix and suffix maximums are the same, meaning no permutation can satisfy both conditions.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The index of the prefix maximum is at position 1, and the index of the suffix maximum is at position 2. The only valid permutation is [1, 2].

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 3
1 2 3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix and suffix maximums are the same, meaning no permutation can satisfy both conditions.
