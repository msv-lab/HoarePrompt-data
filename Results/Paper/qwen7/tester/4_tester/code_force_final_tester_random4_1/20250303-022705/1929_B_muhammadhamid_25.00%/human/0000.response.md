```
**Explanation**: In a 3x3 grid, we need to color 6 cells such that all 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring all cells in the grid.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: In a 3x3 grid, we need to color 5 cells such that 9 diagonals have at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring all but one cell in the grid.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: In a 4x4 grid, we need to color 4 cells such that 7 diagonals have at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring the cells in a specific pattern to cover the required diagonals.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7 11
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: In a 7x7 grid, we need to color 6 cells such that 11 diagonals have at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring cells in a strategic pattern to cover the required diagonals.

# Test 7

```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: In a 2x2 grid, we need to color 2 cells such that 3 diagonals have at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring the cells in the corners of the grid.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
2 2
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
```
**Explanation**: In a 2x2 grid, we need to color 2 cells such that 2 diagonals have at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring the cells in the corners of the grid. For 2 diagonals, we still need to color 2 cells.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```

3 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
```
**Explanation**: In a 3x3 grid, we need to color 2 cells such that 2 diagonals have at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring the cells in the corners of the grid. For 3 diagonals, we still need to color 2 cells.

# Test 10
**Input**:

4 4
4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
4
```
**Explanation**: In a 4x4 grid, we need to color 4 cells such that 4 diagonals have at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring the cells in a specific pattern to cover the required diagonals. For 5 diagonals, we still need to color 4 cells.

# Test 11
**Input**:

5 6
5 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
4
```
**Explanation**: In a 5x5 grid, we need to color 4 cells such that 6 diagonals have at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring the cells in a specific pattern to cover the required diagonals. For 7 diagonals, we still need to color 4 cells.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```

10 1
10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
```
**Explanation**: In a 10x10 grid, we need to color 2 cells such that 1 diagonal has at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring the cells in the corners of the grid. For 2 diagonals, we still need to color 2 cells.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
2
100 1
100 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
```
**Explanation**: In a 100x100 grid, we need to color 2 cells such that 1 diagonal has at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring the cells in the corners of the grid. For 2 diagonals, we still need to color 2 cells.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
2
100000000 1
100000000 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
```
**Explanation**: In a 100000000x100000000 grid, we need to color 2 cells such that 1 diagonal has at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring the cells in the corners of the grid. For 2 diagonals, we still need to color 2 cells.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
2
100000000 400000000
100000000 400000001
