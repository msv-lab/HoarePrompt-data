*Explanation*: The favorite cube is at index 2 with value 3. After sorting, the possible arrangements are [4, 3, 3, 3, 2] and [4, 3, 3, 3, 2]. In both cases, the favorite cube ends up in the second position and will be removed. However, we need to consider if there could be other arrangements where the favorite cube does not end up in the first k positions. Since the arrangement is non-increasing, the favorite cube might not always be in the first k positions, so it is "MAYBE".
