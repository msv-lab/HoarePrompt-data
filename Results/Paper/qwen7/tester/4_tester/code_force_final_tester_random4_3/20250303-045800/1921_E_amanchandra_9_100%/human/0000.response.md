To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Hereâ€™s how we can structure the test cases:

### Basic Test Cases
1. **Objective**: Verify the basic functionality where Alice and Bob start far apart and can reach each other within a few moves.
2. **Objective**: Verify the basic functionality where Alice and Bob start close to each other but still require several moves to reach each other.
3. **Objective**: Verify the basic functionality where Alice and Bob start in such a way that neither can win in a few moves.

### Edge Test Cases
1. **Objective**: Verify the scenario where Alice starts in the last row and Bob starts in the first row, leading to an immediate draw.
2. **Objective**: Verify the scenario where Alice and Bob start very close to each other but are blocked by the board boundaries.
3. **Objective**: Verify the scenario where Alice and Bob start in such a way that the game ends in a draw due to blocked paths.
4. **Objective**: Verify the scenario where Alice and Bob start in such a way that Alice can win in just a few moves.
5. **Objective**: Verify the scenario where Bob can win in just a few moves.

Let's implement these test cases step-by-step:

### Basic Test Cases
```python
# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
6 5 2 2 5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```

Explanation: Alice can move down-right to (3, 3), then Bob can only move up-left to (4, 2), and Alice can move down-right to (4, 4), capturing Bob.

```python
# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
4 1 2 1 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```

Explanation: Alice can only move down to (3, 1), and Bob can move up to (3, 1), capturing Alice.

```python
# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1 4 1 3 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```

Explanation: Alice is in the last row and cannot move, so the game ends in a draw.

### Edge Test Cases
```python
# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
10 10 1 6 10 8
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```

Explanation: Alice can move down-right to (2, 7), then Bob can only move up-left to (9, 9), and Alice can move down-right to (10, 8), capturing Bob.

```python
# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
10 10 2 6 10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```

Explanation: Alice and Bob are close but blocked by the board boundaries, leading to a draw.

```python
# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
10 10 9 1 8 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```

Explanation: Alice is in the last row and cannot move, so the game ends in a draw.

```python
# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
10 10 8 1 10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```

Explanation: Bob can move up-left to (7, 2), then Alice can only move down-right to (9, 3), and Bob can move up-left to (8, 1), capturing Alice.

```python
# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
10 10 1 1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```

Explanation: Alice can move down-right to (2, 2), then Bob can only move up-left to (3, 1), and Alice can move down-right to (4, 2), capturing Bob.

```python
# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
10 10 1 3 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```

Explanation: Alice can move down-right to (2, 4), then Bob can only move up-left to (3, 2), and Alice can move down-right to (4, 3), capturing Bob.

```python
# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
10 10 3 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```

Explanation: Bob can move up-left to (2, 2), then Alice can only move down-right to (4, 3), and Bob can move up-left to (3, 1), capturing Alice.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution handles both typical and edge cases effectively.
