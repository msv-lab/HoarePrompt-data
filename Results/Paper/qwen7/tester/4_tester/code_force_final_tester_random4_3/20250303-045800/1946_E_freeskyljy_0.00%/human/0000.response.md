# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There is only one permutation of length 1, which is `[1]`. Both the prefix and suffix maximums are at index 1, so there is only one valid permutation.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 3
1 2
2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix maximums are at positions 1 and 2, and the indices of the suffix maximums are at positions 2, 3, and 4. The possible permutations are `[1, 4, 3, 2]`, `[2, 4, 3, 1]`, and `[3, 4, 2, 1]`.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 1
1 2 3
3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix maximums are at positions 1, 2, and 3, and the index of the suffix maximum is at position 3. The only possible permutation is `[3, 2, 1]`.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3 4
1 2 3
2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix maximums are at positions 1, 2, and 3, and the indices of the suffix maximums are at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5. No permutation satisfies both conditions simultaneously, hence the result is 0.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
20 5 4
1 2 3 4 12
12 13 18 20
```
**Output**: 
```
317580808
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix maximums are at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 12, and the indices of the suffix maximums are at positions 12, 13, 18, and 20. The number of valid permutations is calculated modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2 3
1 3
3 4 6
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix maximums are at positions 1 and 3, and the indices of the suffix maximums are at positions 3, 4, and 6. The possible permutations are `[2, 1, 6, 5, 3, 4]`, `[3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]`, `[3, 2, 6, 5, 1, 4]`, `[4, 1, 6, 5, 2, 3]`, `[4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 3]`, `[4, 3, 6, 5, 1, 2]`, `[5, 1, 6, 4, 2, 3]`, `[5, 2, 6, 4, 1, 3]`, `[5, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2]`, and `[5, 4, 6, 3, 1, 2]`.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This is a duplicate of Test 1, ensuring consistency in handling single-element permutations.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 4
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix and suffix maximums are at all positions, meaning the only valid permutation is `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1 1
1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The index of the prefix maximum is at position 1, and the index of the suffix maximum is at position 4. No permutation can satisfy both conditions, hence the result is 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 1
1 2 3 4
4
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix maximums are at all positions, but the index of the suffix maximum is at position 4. No permutation can satisfy both conditions, hence the result is 0.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 2
1 2
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix maximums are at positions 1 and 2, and the indices of the suffix maximums are at positions 2 and 3. No permutation can satisfy both conditions, hence the result is 0.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
4 3 3
1 2 3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix and suffix maximums are at positions 1, 2, and 3. No permutation can satisfy both conditions, hence the result is 0.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
4 3 2
1 2 3
2 3

**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix maximums are at positions 1, 2, and 3, and the indices of the suffix maximums are at positions 2 and 3. No permutation can satisfy both conditions, hence the result is 0.

4 2 1
1 2
3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
