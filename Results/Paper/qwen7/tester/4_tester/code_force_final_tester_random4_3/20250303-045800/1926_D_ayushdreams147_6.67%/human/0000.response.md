# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 4 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: Each number has at least one bit position where it differs from the others, so each number must be in its own group.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The two numbers differ in all 31 bits, so they can be placed in the same group.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
476319172 261956880 2136179468 1671164475 1885526767
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Not all pairs of numbers differ in every bit, but some pairs might share common bit differences, requiring at least 3 groups.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1335890506 811593141 1128223362
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Some pairs of numbers might share bit differences, allowing them to be grouped together, but others will require separate groups.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4
688873446 627404104 1520079543 1458610201
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Similar to Test 4, some pairs can be grouped together, while others need their own groups.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4
61545621 2085938026 1269342732 1430258575
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The numbers have varying bit differences, requiring at least 3 groups to ensure no two numbers in the same group have matching bits.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 0 2147483647 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Two zeros can be in the same group, and the other two numbers can be in another group since they differ in all bits.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Two zeros can be in the same group, and the third number must be in another group.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
8
1858058912 289424735 1858058912 2024818580 1858058912 289424735 122665067 289424735
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The numbers have overlapping bit patterns, requiring at least 4 groups to ensure no two numbers in the same group have matching bits.

These test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the solution handles a variety of input sizes and configurations effectively.
