```
No
```
**Explanation**: A 2x1 rectangle can only be cut into two 1x1 rectangles, which do not form a new distinct rectangle.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 6
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a 3x4 rectangle.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 3x2 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 2x2 rectangle can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a 1x4 rectangle.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a 4x2 rectangle.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: A 6x3 rectangle can only be cut into two 6x1 or 3x3 rectangles, neither of which can form a new distinct rectangle when combined.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 10x10 rectangle can be cut into two 10x5 rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a 5x20 rectangle.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: A very large 1000000000x1 rectangle can only be cut into 1x1000000000 rectangles, which do not form a new distinct rectangle.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: A very large 1x1000000000 rectangle can only be cut into 1x1000000000 rectangles, which do not form a new distinct rectangle.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A square 1000000000x1000000000 can be cut into two 1000000000x500000000 rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a 500000000x2000000000 rectangle.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
2
1 2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
No
```
**Explanation**: Both 1x2 and 2x1 rectangles cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles to form a new distinct rectangle.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
3
1 3
3 1
1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
No
No
No
```
**Explanation**: All three cases involve rectangles that cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles to form a new distinct rectangle.

# Test 14

```
4
2 3
3 2
4 5
5 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
Yes
