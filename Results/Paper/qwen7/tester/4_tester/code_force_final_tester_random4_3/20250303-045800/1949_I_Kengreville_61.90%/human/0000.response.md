To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1: Simple Tangent Disks
**Input**:
```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All three disks are tangent to each other. We can reduce the radii of the first and third disks slightly while increasing the radius of the second disk to maintain tangency and decrease the total radius sum.

#### Test 2: Multiple Tangent Disks
**Input**:
```
4
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
3 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All four disks are tangent to each other. Similar to the previous test, we can adjust the radii to maintain tangency and decrease the total radius sum.

#### Test 3: Mixed Tangency and Non-Tangency
**Input**:
```
4
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
2 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The first three disks are tangent to each other, and the fourth disk does not overlap with any others. We can adjust the radii of the first three disks to maintain tangency and decrease the total radius sum.

#### Test 4: Single Disk
**Input**:
```
1
0 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: With only one disk, it is impossible to decrease the radius without violating the condition of having a positive radius.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 5: Maximum Radius Values
**Input**:
```
3
0 0 1000000000
1 0 1000000000
2 0 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The maximum possible radius values are used. We can still adjust the radii to maintain tangency and decrease the total radius sum.

#### Test 6: Minimum Radius Values
**Input**:
```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The minimum possible radius values are used. We can still adjust the radii to maintain tangency and decrease the total radius sum.

#### Test 7: Large Number of Disks
**Input**:
```
10
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
3 0 1
4 0 1
5 0 1
6 0 1
7 0 1
8 0 1
9 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: A large number of disks are tangent to each other. We can adjust the radii to maintain tangency and decrease the total radius sum.

#### Test 8: Disks with Very Close Centers
**Input**:
```
3
0 0 1
0.1 0 1
0.2 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The centers of the disks are very close to each other. We can still adjust the radii to maintain tangency and decrease the total radius sum.

#### Test 9: Disks with Negative Coordinates
**Input**:
```
3
-1 -1 1
0 0 1
1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The disks have negative coordinates. We can still adjust the radii to maintain tangency and decrease the total radius sum.

#### Test 10: Disks with Zero Radius
**Input**:
```
3
0 0 0
1 0 1
2 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: One of the disks has zero radius, making it impossible to decrease the total radius sum without violating the conditions.
