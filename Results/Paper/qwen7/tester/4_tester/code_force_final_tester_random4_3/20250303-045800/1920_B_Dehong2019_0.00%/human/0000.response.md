# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes the only element, making the sum 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1 1
3 1 2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Alice does not remove any elements. Bob multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in the sum being 3 + 1 + 2 - 4 = 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6 3
1 4 3 2 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements. Bob then multiplies 1, 4, and 3 by -1, resulting in the sum being -1 - 4 - 3 + 2 + 5 + 6 = 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6 1
3 7 3 3 32 15
```
**Output**: 
```
-9
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements. Bob then multiplies 32 by -1, resulting in the sum being -3 - 7 - 3 - 3 - 15 = -30. However, since we need to consider the optimal strategy, Bob will choose the smallest positive number to minimize the sum, which is 3, resulting in -3 - 7 - 3 - 3 - (-3) - 15 = -30 + 3 = -27. But the correct minimal sum considering the optimal strategy is -9, which is achieved by removing the largest numbers and multiplying the smallest positive number by -1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
8 5 3
5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
-9
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 5, 5, 9, 9, and 3. Bob then multiplies 3, 3, and 3 by -1, resulting in the sum being -5 - 5 - 2 - 3 - 3 - 3 = -21. The optimal strategy would be to remove the largest numbers and then multiply the smallest positive numbers by -1, resulting in -5 - 5 - 2 - 3 - 3 - 3 = -19. But the correct minimal sum is -9, which is achieved by removing the largest numbers and then multiplying the smallest positive numbers by -1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10 6 4
1 8 2 9 3 3 4 5 3 200
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 200, 9, 8, 5, 4, and 3. Bob then multiplies 3, 3, and 3 by -1, resulting in the sum being -1 - 2 - 3 - 3 - 3 = -12. The optimal strategy would be to remove the largest numbers and then multiply the smallest positive numbers by -1, resulting in -1 - 2 - 3 - 3 - 3 = -12. But the correct minimal sum is 0, which is achieved by removing the largest numbers and then multiplying the smallest positive numbers by -1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 1
4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 4 and 3. Bob then multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in the sum being -4 - 3 = -7. The optimal strategy would be to remove the largest numbers and then multiply the smallest positive number by -1, resulting in -4 - 3 = -7. But the correct minimal sum is -1, which is achieved by removing the largest numbers and then multiplying the smallest positive number by -1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-2
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 3. Bob then multiplies 1 and 3 by -1, resulting in the sum being -1 - 3 = -4. The optimal strategy would be to remove the largest number and then multiply the smallest positive number by -1, resulting in -1 - 3 = -4. But the correct minimal sum is -2, which is achieved by removing the largest number and then multiplying the smallest positive number by -1.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes the only element, making the sum 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes the only element, making the sum 0.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 1
1000 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
1998
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes both elements. Bob then multiplies one of them by -1, resulting in the sum being -1000 + 1000 = 0. But the correct sum is 1998, which is achieved by not removing any elements and Bob not changing anything.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements. Bob then multiplies all remaining elements by -1, resulting in the sum being 0.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements. Bob then multiplies all remaining elements by -1, resulting in the sum being 0.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```

6 6 6
1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements. Bob then multiplies all remaining elements by -1, resulting in the sum being 0.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1

```
**Output**: 
```
0

**Output**: 
```
1998
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes both elements. Bob then multiplies one of them by -1, resulting in the sum being -1000 + 1000 = 0. But the correct sum is 1998, which is achieved by not removing any elements and Bob not changing anything.
