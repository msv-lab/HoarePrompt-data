### Test Cases

#### Basic Test Cases

**Test 1**
- **Objective**: Verify the basic functionality where Alice removes elements and Bob multiplies elements to minimize the sum.
- **Input**:
```
1
4 1 1
3 1 2 4
```
- **Output**:
```
2
```
- **Explanation**: Alice can remove the smallest element 1. Bob can then multiply the largest element 4 by -1. The resulting array is [3, 1, -4], and the sum is 3 + 1 - 4 = 0. However, since Bob can only multiply one element, he multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in a sum of 3 + 1 - 4 = 0. But the correct sum after optimal play is 3 + 1 - 4 = 0, which simplifies to 2.

**Test 2**
- **Objective**: Verify the scenario where Alice removes elements and Bob multiplies elements to maximize the sum.
- **Input**:
```
1
4 1 1
-3 -1 -2 -4
```
- **Output**:
```
-2
```
- **Explanation**: Alice can remove the smallest element -4. Bob can then multiply the largest element -3 by -1. The resulting array is [-1, -2, 3], and the sum is -1 - 2 + 3 = 0. But the correct sum after optimal play is -1 - 2 + 3 = 0, which simplifies to -2.

**Test 3**
- **Objective**: Verify the scenario where Alice removes elements and Bob multiplies elements to achieve a zero sum.
- **Input**:
```
1
4 2 1
-1 -2 -3 -4
```
- **Output**:
```
0
```
- **Explanation**: Alice can remove the two smallest elements -1 and -2. Bob can then multiply the largest element -3 by -1. The resulting array is [-4], and the sum is -4. But the correct sum after optimal play is 0.

**Test 4**
- **Objective**: Verify the scenario where Alice removes elements and Bob multiplies elements to achieve a positive sum.
- **Input**:
```
1
4 2 1
1 2 3 4
```
- **Output**:
```
10
```
- **Explanation**: Alice can remove the two smallest elements 1 and 2. Bob can then multiply the largest element 4 by -1. The resulting array is [3], and the sum is 3. But the correct sum after optimal play is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

**Test 5**
- **Objective**: Verify the scenario where Alice removes elements and Bob multiplies elements to achieve a negative sum.
- **Input**:
```
1
4 2 1
-1 -2 -3 -4
```
- **Explanation**: Alice can remove the two smallest elements -1 and -2. Bob can then multiply the largest element -3 by -1. The resulting array is [-4], and the sum is -4. But the correct sum after optimal play is -1 - 2 - 3 - 4 = -10, which simplifies to -10.

**Test 6**
- **Objective**: Verify the scenario where Alice removes elements and Bob multiplies elements to achieve a mixed sum.
- **Input**:
```
1
4 2 1
-1 2 -3 4
```
- **Explanation**: Alice can remove the two smallest elements -1 and -3. Bob can then multiply the largest element 4 by -1. The resulting array is [2], and the sum is 2. But the correct sum after optimal play is -1 + 2 - 3 + 4 = 2.

#### Edge Test Cases

**Test 7**
- **Objective**: Verify the scenario where Alice has no elements to remove.
- **Input**:
```
1
4 0 1
1 2 3 4
```
- **Output**:
```
10
```
- **Explanation**: Alice cannot remove any elements, so the array remains unchanged. Bob can then multiply the largest element 4 by -1. The resulting array is [1, 2, 3, -4], and the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 = 2. But the correct sum after optimal play is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

**Test 8**
- **Objective**: Verify the scenario where Bob has no elements to multiply.
- **Input**:
```
1
4 1 0
1 2 3 4
```
- **Output**:
```
10
```
- **Explanation**: Alice can remove the smallest element 1. The array becomes [2, 3, 4], and the sum is 2 + 3 + 4 = 9. But the correct sum after optimal play is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

**Test 9**
- **Objective**: Verify the scenario where Alice removes all elements.
- **Input**:
```
1
4 4 1
1 2 3 4
```
- **Output**:
```
0
```
- **Explanation**: Alice can remove all elements. The array becomes empty, and the sum is 0.

**Test 10**
- **Objective**: Verify the scenario where Bob multiplies all elements.
- **Input**:
```
1
4 1 4
1 2 3 4
```
- **Output**:
```
-10
```
- **Explanation**: Alice can remove the smallest element 1. Bob can then multiply all remaining elements by -1. The resulting array is [-2, -3, -4], and the sum is -2 - 3 - 4 = -9. But the correct sum after optimal play is -1 - 2 - 3 - 4 = -10.

**Test 11**
- **Objective**: Verify the scenario where Alice and Bob play optimally with large values.
- **Input**:
```
1
8 5 3
5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9
```
- **Output**:
```
-9
```
- **Explanation**: Alice can remove the five smallest elements 2, 3, 3, 3, 5. Bob can then multiply the largest elements 9, 9, 5 by -1. The resulting array is [-2, -3, -3, -3], and the sum is -2 - 3 - 3 - 3 = -11. But the correct sum after optimal play is 5 + 5 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 - 9 - 9 - 5 = -9.

**Test 12**
- **Objective**: Verify the scenario where Alice and Bob play optimally with very small values.
- **Input**:
```
1
2 1 1
-1 -2
```
- **Output**:
```
-1
```
- **Explanation**: Alice can remove the smallest element -2. Bob can then multiply the largest element -1 by -1. The resulting array is [1], and the sum is 1. But the correct sum after optimal play is -1 - 2 = -3, which simplifies to -1.

**Test 13**
- **Objective**: Verify the scenario where Alice and Bob play optimally with a single element.
- **Input**:
```
1
1 1 1
1
```
- **Output**:
```
0
```
- **Explanation**: Alice can remove the only element 1. The array becomes empty, and the sum is 0.

**Test 14**
- **Objective**: Verify the scenario where Alice and Bob play optimally with the maximum allowed values.
- **Input**:
```
1
2 2 2
1000 1000
```
- **Output**:
```
2000
```
- **Explanation**: Alice can remove one element 1000. Bob can then multiply the other element 1000 by -1. The resulting array is [1000, -1000], and the sum is 1000 - 1000 = 0. But the correct sum after optimal play is 1000 + 1000 = 2000.
