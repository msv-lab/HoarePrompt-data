To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works when the initial and final states are the same.
**Input**:
```
1
5
10010
10010
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No changes are needed since the initial state matches the final state.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works when the initial state has fewer cats than the final state.
**Input**:
```
1
5
00010
11111
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: We need to add a cat to each of the five boxes, resulting in four operations.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works when the initial state has more cats than the final state.
**Input**:
```
1
5
11111
00000
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Explanation**: We need to remove a cat from each of the five boxes, resulting in five operations.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works when the initial and final states differ in the positions of cats.
**Input**:
```
1
5
10010
01101
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: We need to move the cat from the first box to the fifth, and move the cat from the fourth box to the second, and move the cat from the third box to the fourth, resulting in three operations.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function works when all boxes are initially empty and need to be filled.
**Input**:
```
1
5
00000
11111
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Explanation**: We need to fill each of the five boxes, resulting in five operations.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function works when all boxes are initially full and need to be emptied.
**Input**:
```
1
5
11111
00000
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Explanation**: We need to empty each of the five boxes, resulting in five operations.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function works when the initial state has all cats in one box and needs to be distributed.
**Input**:
```
1
5
10000
11111
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: We need to move the cat from the first box to each of the other four boxes, resulting in four operations.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function works when the final state has all cats in one box and needs to be collected.
**Input**:
```
1
5
11111
10000
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: We need to move the cat from each of the five boxes to the first box, resulting in four operations.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function works when the initial and final states are reversed.
**Input**:
```
1
5
11111
00000
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Explanation**: We need to empty each of the five boxes, resulting in five operations.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function works when the initial and final states are identical but with different orders of cats.
**Input**:
```
1
5
10101
10101
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No changes are needed since the initial state matches the final state.
