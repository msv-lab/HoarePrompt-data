# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
*Explanation*: k must be between 3 and 10, and not equal to 1 or 5. The valid values are 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 5
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: k must be greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to 4, which is impossible.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10
3 6
3 7
1 2
1 7
3 100
3 44
2 100
2 98
1 3
3 99
```
**Output**: 
```
90
```
*Explanation*: k must be between 2 and 98, but not equal to 6, 7, 100, 44, or 99. The valid range is from 2 to 98 excluding the mentioned values, resulting in 90 valid integers.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
10
3 6
3 7
1 2
1 7
3 100
3 44
2 100
2 98
1 3
3 99
```
**Output**: 
```
90
```
*Explanation*: Same as Test 3, ensuring consistency in the function's handling of duplicate constraints.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10
3 6
3 7
1 2
1 7
3 100
3 44
2 100
2 98
1 3
3 99
```
**Output**: 
```
90
```
*Explanation*: Same as Test 3, ensuring the function handles constraints in any order correctly.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 5
2 10
1 9
2 2
3 2
3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: k must be between 5 and 9, but not equal to 2. Since 2 is within the range, there are no valid integers.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1
2 2
3 1
3 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: k must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2, but not equal to 1, 2, or 3. There are no valid integers.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 10000
2 900000000
3 500000000
1 10000
3 10000
3 900000001
```
**Output**: 
```
800000000
```
*Explanation*: k must be between 10000 and 900000000, but not equal to 500000000, 10000, or 900000001. The valid range is from 10000 to 900000000 excluding the mentioned values, resulting in 800000000 valid integers.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: k must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2, but there is no integer that satisfies both conditions simultaneously.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: k must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1, but there is no integer that satisfies both conditions simultaneously.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1
2 10
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: k must be between 1 and 10, but not equal to 5. Since 5 is within the range, there are no valid integers.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1
2 10
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
*Explanation*: k must be between 1 and 10, but not equal to 1. The valid range is from 2 to 10, resulting in 8 valid integers.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1
2 10
3 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: k must be between 1 and 10, but not equal to 10. Since 10 is within the range, there are no valid integers.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1
2 10
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
*Explanation*: k must be between 1 and 10, but not equal to 2. The valid range is from 1 to 10 excluding 2, resulting in 7 valid integers.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1
2 10
3 11
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: k must be between 1 and 10, but not equal to 11. Since 11 is outside the range, there are no valid integers.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1
2 10
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
*Explanation*: k must be between 1 and 10, but not equal to 1. The valid range is from 2 to 10, resulting in 8 valid integers.
