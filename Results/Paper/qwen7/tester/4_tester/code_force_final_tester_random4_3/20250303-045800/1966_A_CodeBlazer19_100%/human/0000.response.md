# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
10 20 30 10 20 40
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```

3 2
1 1 2
3 3
1 1 1
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
3
5
```
*Explanation*: In the first case, we can exchange the two 1s to get one 1, leaving us with 1 card. In the second case, since k equals n, no exchanges can be made, and the result is 3. In the third case, each card is unique, so no exchanges can be made, and the result is 5.

# Test 9

3
```
*Explanation*: In the first case, we can exchange the two 2s to get one 2, leaving us with 2 cards. In the second case, since k equals n, no exchanges can be made, and the result is 4. In the third case, we can exchange the three 1s to get two 1s, leaving us with 3 cards.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
2
10
3
```
*Explanation*: In the first case, we can exchange five 1s to get four 1s, and then exchange four 1s to get three 1s, and finally exchange three 1s to get two 1s, leaving us with 2 cards. In the second case, since k equals n, no exchanges can be made, and the result is 10. In the third case, we can exchange the two 1s to get one 1, and then exchange the two 2s to get one 2, leaving us with 3 cards.
