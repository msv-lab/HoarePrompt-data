# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4
10011
1110
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The first 2 characters of '10011' (i.e., '10') form a subsequence of '1110'. The next character '0' does not form a subsequence, so the maximum k is 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
100
110
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The first 2 characters of '100' (i.e., '10') form a subsequence of '110'. The next character '0' does not form a subsequence, so the maximum k is 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1 3
1
111
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The first 1 character of '1' forms a subsequence of '111'. The next character does not exist, so the maximum k is 1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
1011
1111
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The first 1 character of '1011' (i.e., '1') forms a subsequence of '1111'. The next characters do not form a subsequence in order, so the maximum k is 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5
100
11010
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The first 3 characters of '100' (i.e., '100') form a subsequence of '11010'. The next character '0' does not form a subsequence, so the maximum k is 3.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
100
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The binary string '0' does not contain any '1', so no prefix of '100' can form a subsequence of '0'. Therefore, the maximum k is 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1
1
1
2 2
00
00
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2
```
*Explanation*: For the first test case, the entire string '1' forms a subsequence of '1'. For the second test case, both prefixes of '00' (i.e., '0' and '00') form subsequences of '00'. Therefore, the maximum k is 2.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
2 3
11
101
3 4
101
1111
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1
```
*Explanation*: For the first test case, the first 2 characters of '11' (i.e., '11') form a subsequence of '101'. For the second test case, the first character of '101' (i.e., '1') forms a subsequence of '1111', but the next characters do not. Therefore, the maximum k is 1.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
5 5
10011
11111
6 6
111000
111000
```
**Output**: 
```
5
6
```
*Explanation*: For the first test case, the entire string '10011' forms a subsequence of '11111'. For the second test case, the entire string '111000' forms a subsequence of '111000'. Therefore, the maximum k is 6.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
0101010101
1010101010
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: The entire string '0101010101' forms a subsequence of '1010101010'. Therefore, the maximum k is 10.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
11
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The binary string '0' does not contain any '1', so no prefix of '11' can form a subsequence of '0'. Therefore, the maximum k is 0.
