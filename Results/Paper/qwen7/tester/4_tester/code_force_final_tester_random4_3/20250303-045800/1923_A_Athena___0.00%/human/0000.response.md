### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when all cells contain chips.
**Input**:
```
1
6
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All cells contain chips, so no operations are needed to form a single block.

### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when all cells except one contain chips.
**Input**:
```
1
6
0 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There is one free cell at the beginning, and moving the chip from the second cell to the first cell forms a single block.

### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the chips are already in a single block.
**Input**:
```
1
6
1 1 1 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All chips are already in a single block, so no operations are needed.

### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the chips are spread out but can be moved to form a single block.
**Input**:
```
1
8
0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Two operations are needed to move the chips to form a single block. For instance, moving the chip from the 4th cell to the 3rd cell, and then moving the chip from the 7th cell to the 6th cell.

### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the chips are spread out and require multiple moves.
**Input**:
```
1
9
0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Three operations are needed to move the chips to form a single block. For instance, moving the chip from the 4th cell to the 3rd cell, the chip from the 7th cell to the 6th cell, and the chip from the 9th cell to the 8th cell.

### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the number of cells is minimal (n=2).
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Both cells contain chips, so no operations are needed.

### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the number of cells is minimal (n=2) and one cell is free.
**Input**:
```
1
2
0 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: One operation is needed to move the chip to the free cell.

### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the number of cells is minimal (n=2) and both cells contain chips.
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Both cells contain chips, so no operations are needed.

### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the number of cells is maximal (n=50).
**Input**:
```
1
50
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All cells contain chips, so no operations are needed.

### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the number of cells is maximal (n=50) and only one cell is free.
**Input**:
```
1
50
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
49
```
**Explanation**: All chips need to be moved to the single free cell, requiring 49 operations.

### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the number of cells is maximal (n=50) and the chips are spread out.
**Input**:
```
1
50
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
48
```
**Explanation**: 48 operations are needed to move the chips to the leftmost cell.
