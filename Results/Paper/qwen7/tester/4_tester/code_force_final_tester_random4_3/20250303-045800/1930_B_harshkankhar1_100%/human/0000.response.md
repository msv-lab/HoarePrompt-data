To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function with a small, manageable input size.
**Input**:
```
1
3
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3
```
**Explanation**: This is a simple permutation of length 3, which trivially satisfies the condition since no pair of elements has the property where one divides the other.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function with a slightly larger input size.
**Input**:
```
1
4
```
**Output**:
```
4 1 2 3
```
**Explanation**: This permutation of length 4 is valid because no pair of consecutive elements has the property where one divides the other.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function with a larger input size.
**Input**:
```
1
5
```
**Output**:
```
5 1 2 4 3
```
**Explanation**: This permutation of length 5 is valid because no pair of consecutive elements has the property where one divides the other.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function with the minimum allowed input size.
**Input**:
```
1
3
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3
```
**Explanation**: This is the smallest possible input, and the output must be a valid permutation of length 3.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function with the maximum allowed input size.
**Input**:
```
1
100000
```
**Output**:
```
100000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... 99999
```
**Explanation**: This is the largest possible input. The output must be a valid permutation of length 100000, ensuring no pair of consecutive elements has the property where one divides the other.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function with a permutation that starts with the highest number.
**Input**:
```
1
5
```
**Output**:
```
5 1 2 4 3
```
**Explanation**: Starting with the highest number ensures that the permutation is valid and meets the criteria.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function with a permutation that includes repeated numbers (though this is not allowed).
**Input**:
```
1
5
```
**Output**:
```
5 1 2 4 4
```
**Explanation**: This is an invalid input as the permutation should contain distinct integers. However, including this case helps ensure the solution handles such inputs gracefully.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function with a permutation that includes a sequence where the next element is a divisor of the previous one.
**Input**:
```
1
4
```
**Output**:
```
4 1 2 3
```
**Explanation**: This is a valid permutation, but it includes a sequence (4, 1, 2, 3) where 4 does not divide 1, 1 does not divide 2, 2 does not divide 3, and 3 does not divide 4.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function with a permutation that includes a sequence where the next element is a multiple of the previous one.
**Input**:
```
1
4
```
**Output**:
```
4 2 1 3
```
**Explanation**: This is a valid permutation, but it includes a sequence (4, 2, 1, 3) where 4 does not divide 2, 2 does not divide 1, 1 does not divide 3, and 3 does not divide 4.

### Summary
These test cases cover a range of scenarios from basic to edge cases, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
