# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10
1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: We have 10 cards of type 1 initially. By buying 10 more cards of type 1, we can form a sequence of 20 cards all being 1. This sequence has 10 contiguous subarrays of length 1 that are permutations of [1], hence the output is 10.
