# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
43
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: There is only one container, so it is trivially possible to make the amount of water the same.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: There is only one container with zero water, which is also trivially possible.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The sum of the elements is 4, which is not divisible by 2, making it impossible to equalize the water.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The sum of the elements is 15, which is divisible by 5. By pouring water appropriately, we can make all containers have 3 units of water.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The sum of the elements is 6, which is divisible by 3. By pouring water appropriately, we can make all containers have 2 units of water.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The sum of the elements is 28, which is not divisible by 7, making it impossible to equalize the water.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The sum of the elements is 28, which is not divisible by 7, making it impossible to equalize the water.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: There is only one container with zero water, which is trivially possible.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The sum of the elements is 2000000000, which is divisible by 2. Both containers can have 1000000000 units of water.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000000000 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The sum of the elements is 1000000000, which is divisible by 3. All containers can have 333333333 units of water.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: All containers already have 0 units of water, which is trivially possible.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The sum of the elements is 5, which is divisible by 5. All containers already have 1 unit of water.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The sum of the elements is 15, which is divisible by 5, but the distribution cannot be made uniform without violating the condition \(i < j\).

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The sum of the elements is 2000000000, which is divisible by 2. Both containers can have 1000000000 units of water.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The sum of the elements is 3, which is divisible by 3. All containers already have 1 unit of water.
