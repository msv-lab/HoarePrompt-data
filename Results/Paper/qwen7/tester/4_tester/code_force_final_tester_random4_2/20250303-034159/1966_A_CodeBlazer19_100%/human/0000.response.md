# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With k=3, we can perform the operation to reduce the number of cards from 5 to 2 as shown in the problem description.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10
7
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With only one card, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
7 2
4 2 1 100 5 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: We can perform operations to reduce the number of cards to 1. For instance, we can keep reducing pairs of the same number until only one card remains.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
10 4
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Since k=4, we can only exchange groups of 4 cards. After performing the operation three times, we will be left with 3 cards.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2
3 8 1 48 7
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: With k=2, we cannot perform any operations since no two cards have the same number. Therefore, the minimum number of cards remains 5.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
10 20 30 10 20 40
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: We can perform operations to reduce the number of cards to 1. For instance, we can keep reducing pairs of the same number until only one card remains.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
10 20 30 10 20 40
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: With k=3, we cannot perform any operations since no three cards have the same number. Therefore, the minimum number of cards remains 6.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: We can perform operations to reduce the number of cards to 1. For instance, we can keep reducing pairs of the same number until only one card remains.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: With k=4, we cannot perform any operations since no four cards have the same number. Therefore, the minimum number of cards remains 4.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With k=10, we can perform the operation once to reduce the number of cards to 1.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: With k=10, we cannot perform any operations since no ten cards have the same number. Therefore, the minimum number of cards remains 10.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5
1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: We can perform operations to reduce the number of cards to 2. For instance, we can keep reducing groups of 5 cards until only 2 cards remain.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5
1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: With k=5, we can only exchange groups of 5 cards. After performing the operation once, we will be left with 5 cards.
