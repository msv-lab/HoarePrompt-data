# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4
10011
1110
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The first 2 characters of "10011" (i.e., "10") form a subsequence of "1110". The next character "0" does not form a subsequence, so the answer is 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
100
110
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The first 2 characters of "100" (i.e., "10") form a subsequence of "110". The next character "0" does not form a subsequence, so the answer is 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1 3
1
111
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The first 1 character of "1" forms a subsequence of "111". The next character does not exist in "111", so the answer is 1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
1011
1111
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The first 1 character of "1011" (i.e., "1") forms a subsequence of "1111". The next characters do not form a subsequence, so the answer is 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5
100
11010
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The first 3 characters of "100" (i.e., "100") form a subsequence of "11010". The next character does not exist in "11010", so the answer is 3.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
100
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The string "100" does not have any prefix that forms a subsequence of "0". So the answer is 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1
1
1
2 2
00
00
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2
```
*Explanation*: For the first test case, the entire string "1" forms a subsequence of "1". For the second test case, both prefixes "0" and "00" form subsequences of "00".

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
2 2
01
10
3 3
111
111
```
**Output**: 
```
1
3
```
*Explanation*: For the first test case, the prefix "0" forms a subsequence of "10". For the second test case, the entire string "111" forms a subsequence of "111".

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
5 5
10011
11011
3 3
000
000
```
**Output**: 
```
2
3
```
*Explanation*: For the first test case, the prefix "10" forms a subsequence of "11011". For the second test case, the entire string "000" forms a subsequence of "000".

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
2
10 10
1010101010
1010101010
1 1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
10
1
```
*Explanation*: For the first test case, the entire string "1010101010" forms a subsequence of itself. For the second test case, the prefix "1" forms a subsequence of "1".

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
2
1 2
1
00
2 1
01
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
*Explanation*: For the first test case, the prefix "1" forms a subsequence of "00". For the second test case, no prefix of "01" forms a subsequence of "1".

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
2
4 4
0000
1111
1 2
1
00
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
```
*Explanation*: For the first test case, no prefix of "0000" forms a subsequence of "1111". For the second test case, no prefix of "1" forms a subsequence of "00".

These test cases cover basic and edge scenarios to ensure the solution's robustness, reliability, and scalability.
