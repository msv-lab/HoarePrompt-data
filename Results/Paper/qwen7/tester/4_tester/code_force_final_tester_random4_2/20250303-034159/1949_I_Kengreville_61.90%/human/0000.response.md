To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1: Simple Configuration with Tangent Disks
**Input**:
```
5
0 2 1
0 0 1
4 -3 4
11 0 3
11 5 2
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The input configuration allows for a valid reduction in radii while maintaining tangency and non-overlapping conditions.

#### Test 2: Configuration with Non-Tangent Disks
**Input**:
```
4
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
3 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: All disks are tangent to each other at the origin, and reducing their radii would cause them to overlap.

#### Test 3: Single Disk
**Input**:
```
1
0 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: With only one disk, it is impossible to reduce its radius without overlapping.

#### Test 4: Multiple Disks with Complex Tangencies
**Input**:
```
6
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
3 0 1
4 0 1
5 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: All disks are tangent to each other, and reducing their radii would cause them to overlap.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 5: Disks with Very Large Radii
**Input**:
```
3
0 0 1000000000
1 0 1000000000
2 0 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The large radii make it impossible to reduce them without causing overlap.

#### Test 6: Disks with Very Small Radii
**Input**:
```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The small radii make it impossible to reduce them without causing overlap.

#### Test 7: Disks with Zero Radius
**Input**:
```
3
0 0 0
1 0 0
2 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Disks with zero radius are invalid as they cannot have a positive radius.

#### Test 8: Disks with Negative Coordinates
**Input**:
```
3
-1 0 1
0 0 1
1 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Negative coordinates are not meaningful in this context, and the problem specifies integer coordinates.

#### Test 9: Disks with Maximum Integer Coordinates
**Input**:
```
3
1000000000 1000000000 1
1000000001 1000000000 1
1000000000 1000000001 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The maximum integer coordinates make it impossible to reduce the radii without causing overlap.

#### Test 10: Disks with Minimum Integer Coordinates
**Input**:
```
3
-1000000000 -1000000000 1
-1000000001 -1000000000 1
-1000000000 -1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The minimum integer coordinates make it impossible to reduce the radii without causing overlap.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring that the solution handles both typical and edge cases effectively.
