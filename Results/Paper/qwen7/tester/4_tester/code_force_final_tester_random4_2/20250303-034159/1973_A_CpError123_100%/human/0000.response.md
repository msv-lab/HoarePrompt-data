To address the given problem, we will create comprehensive test cases that cover both basic and edge scenarios. Below are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the case where no games were played at all.
**Input**:
```
0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Since no games were played, no draws could have occurred.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the case where one game was played and resulted in a draw.
**Input**:
```
0 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: One game between the second and third players resulted in a draw, giving each 1 point.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the case where all players have the same score and it is achievable through draws.
**Input**:
```
1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This is an impossible scenario because if all players have the same score, it means no games were played, which contradicts the condition that the scores are non-decreasing.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the case where the scores are 1, 1, and 2 with two draws.
**Input**:
```
1 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Two games could have resulted in one draw (1 point each) and one game where one player won (2 points).

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the case where the scores are 3, 3, and 3, which is impossible.
**Input**:
```
3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This is an impossible scenario because if all players have the same score, it means no games were played, which contradicts the condition that the scores are non-decreasing.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the case where the scores are 3, 4, and 5 with six draws.
**Input**:
```
3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: Six games could have resulted in three draws (1 point each), one game where one player won (2 points), and another game where one player won (2 points).

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the case where the scores are 1, 1, and 10, which is impossible.
**Input**:
```
1 1 10
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This is an impossible scenario because the maximum score a player can achieve without any draws is 6 (3 wins), and achieving 10 points requires more than 6 wins, which is not possible with the given constraints.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the case where the maximum score is achieved with the minimum number of games.
**Input**:
```
0 0 6
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Three games where one player won each time would result in the maximum score of 6 for the highest scorer.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the case where the middle score is exactly half the maximum score.
**Input**:
```
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: One game where one player won and one game where the other player won, resulting in scores of 1, 2, and 3.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the case where the scores are at the boundary values.
**Input**:
```
0 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This is an impossible scenario because if the middle player has 3 points, it means either one win and one draw or three draws, but the highest player cannot have 3 points if the middle player has 3 points without additional games.

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the case where the scores are at the maximum boundary.
**Input**:
```
30 30 30
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This is an impossible scenario because if all players have the same score of 30, it means no games were played, which contradicts the condition that the scores are non-decreasing.

#### Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the case where the scores are just below the maximum boundary.
**Input**:
```
29 29 30
```
**Output**:
```
14
```
**Explanation**: Fifteen games could have resulted in seven draws (1 point each) and eight wins (2 points each).

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios from basic to edge cases, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
