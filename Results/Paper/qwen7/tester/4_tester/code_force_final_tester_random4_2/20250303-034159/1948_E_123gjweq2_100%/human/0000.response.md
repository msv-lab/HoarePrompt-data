# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with the smallest possible input values.
**Input**: 
```
3
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = 2 \). The condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) holds for all pairs, so the entire graph forms a single clique.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a slightly larger input.
**Input**: 
```
3
5 4
```
**Output**: 
```
3 1 5 2 4
2
1 1 2 1 2
```
**Explanation**: For \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 4 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 3 \), \( a_3 = 5 \), \( a_4 = 2 \), and \( a_5 = 4 \). The pairs \((1, 2)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 4)\), \((4, 5)\) satisfy the condition, but \((1, 3)\), \((2, 4)\), \((3, 5)\) do not. Thus, we can partition the graph into two cliques: \(\{1, 2\}\) and \(\{3, 4, 5\}\).

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with the maximum value of \( n \).
**Input**: 
```
3
8 16
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: For \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 16 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 2 \), \( a_3 = 3 \), \( a_4 = 4 \), \( a_5 = 5 \), \( a_6 = 6 \), \( a_7 = 7 \), and \( a_8 = 8 \). Since \( k = 16 \), all pairs \((i, j)\) will satisfy the condition, forming a single clique.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with the minimum value of \( k \).
**Input**: 
```
3
4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4
2
1 1 2 2
```
**Explanation**: For \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 1 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 2 \), \( a_3 = 3 \), and \( a_4 = 4 \). The pairs \((1, 2)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 4)\) satisfy the condition, but \((1, 3)\), \((2, 4)\) do not. Thus, we can partition the graph into two cliques: \(\{1, 2\}\) and \(\{3, 4\}\).

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with \( n \) and \( k \) where \( k \) is close to \( 2n \).
**Input**: 
```

4 7
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4
2
1 1 2 2
```
**Explanation**: For \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 7 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 2 \), \( a_3 = 3 \), and \( a_4 = 4 \). Since \( k = 7 \), most pairs will satisfy the condition, but some specific pairs like \((1, 3)\), \((2, 4)\) do not. Thus, we can partition the graph into two cliques: \(\{1, 2\}\) and \(\{3, 4\}\).

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with \( n \) and \( k \) where \( k \) is very small compared to \( n \).
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4
2
1 1 2 2
```
**Explanation**: For \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 2 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 2 \), \( a_3 = 3 \), and \( a_4 = 4 \). The pairs \((1, 2)\) and \((3, 4)\) satisfy the condition, but \((1, 3)\), \((2, 4)\) do not. Thus, we can partition the graph into two cliques: \(\{1, 2\}\) and \(\{3, 4\}\).

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where \( n = 2 \) and \( k \) is just enough to form a single clique.
**Input**:

**Output**: 
```
2 1

1 1
```
**Explanation**: For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = 2 \). The condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) holds for all pairs, so the entire graph forms a single clique.

# Test 8

2
1 1 2 2
```
**Explanation**: For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 1 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = 2 \). The pairs \((1, 2)\) do not satisfy the condition, so we partition the graph into two cliques: \(\{1\}\) and \(\{2\}\).

# Test 9

**Input**:

```
**Explanation**: For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 2 \), and \( a_3 = 3 \). The condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) holds for all pairs, so the entire graph forms a single clique.

```
**Explanation**: For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 2 \), and \( a_3 = 3 \). The condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) holds for all pairs, so the entire graph forms a single clique.

```
**Explanation**: For \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 8 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 2 \), \( a_3 = 3 \), and \( a_4 = 4 \). Since \( k = 8 \), all pairs \((i, j)\) will satisfy the condition, forming a single clique.
