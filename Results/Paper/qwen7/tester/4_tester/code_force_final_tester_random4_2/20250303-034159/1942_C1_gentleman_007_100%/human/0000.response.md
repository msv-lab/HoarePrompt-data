To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a simple polygon with a small number of sides and a few chosen vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides, choosing vertices 1 and 3 allows for only one triangle to be formed.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a polygon where the number of sides is slightly larger and the number of chosen vertices is also larger.
**Input**:
```
1
6 3 0
1 3 5
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With 6 sides, choosing vertices 1, 3, and 5 allows for two triangles to be formed.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a polygon where the number of sides is significantly larger and the number of chosen vertices is also larger.
**Input**:
```
1
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With 8 sides, choosing vertices 1, 6, 2, and 5 allows for two triangles to be formed.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the minimum number of sides (4).
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The minimum polygon with 4 sides, choosing vertices 1 and 3 allows for only one triangle to be formed.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the maximum number of chosen vertices (x = n).
**Input**:
```
1
8 8 0
1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: With 8 sides, choosing all vertices allows for 6 triangles to be formed.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where y = 0 and there are no additional vertices to choose.
**Input**:
```
1
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With 8 sides, choosing vertices 1, 6, 2, and 5 allows for two triangles to be formed, and since y = 0, no additional vertices can be chosen.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the polygon has an odd number of sides.
**Input**:
```
1
5 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 5 sides, choosing vertices 1 and 3 allows for only one triangle to be formed.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the polygon has an even number of sides.
**Input**:
```
1
6 3 0
1 3 5
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With 6 sides, choosing vertices 1, 3, and 5 allows for two triangles to be formed.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the polygon has a large number of sides and a small number of chosen vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 2 0
1 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 1,000,000,000 sides, choosing vertices 1 and 1,000,000,000 allows for only one triangle to be formed.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the polygon has a large number of sides and a large number of chosen vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1000000000 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
999999998
```
**Explanation**: With 1,000,000,000 sides, choosing all vertices allows for 999,999,998 triangles to be formed.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
