# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
*Explanation*: The array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 0
```
*Explanation*: The array `[0, 1, 0]` has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[0, 0]`. Here, `[0, 0]` is considered a valid increasing subsequence because the elements are the same and appear in the correct order.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
13
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 2 3 4 2
```
*Explanation*: The array `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` has exactly 13 increasing subsequences. The subsequences include all possible combinations of the elements while maintaining the increasing order.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
37
```
**Output**: 
```
7
-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
```
*Explanation*: The array `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` has exactly 37 increasing subsequences. This is a more complex case where the array includes repeated and negative elements, ensuring the count of increasing subsequences matches the requirement.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: There is no array of length at most 200 that has exactly 1 increasing subsequence, which is the empty subsequence. Therefore, the output is `-1`.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: Given the constraint \(10^{18}\), it is impossible to construct an array of length at most 200 that has exactly \(10^{18}\) increasing subsequences. Thus, the output is `-1`.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
0 1
```
*Explanation*: The array `[0, 1]` has exactly 4 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence, `[0]`, `[1]`, and `[0, 1]`.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
9
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 2
```
*Explanation*: The array `[0, 1, 2]` has exactly 9 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[2]`, `[0, 1]`, `[0, 2]`, `[1, 2]`, and `[0, 1, 2]`.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 0 1
```
*Explanation*: The array `[0, 0, 1]` has exactly 6 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence, `[0]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 0]`, and `[0, 1]`. Here, `[0]` appears twice, but the subsequences are counted based on their unique elements and order.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
8
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 1
```
*Explanation*: The array `[0, 1, 1]` has exactly 8 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, `[0, 1]`, `[1, 1]`, and `[0, 1, 1]`. Here, `[1]` appears twice, but the subsequences are counted based on their unique elements and order.

These test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the solution handles a wide range of inputs effectively.
