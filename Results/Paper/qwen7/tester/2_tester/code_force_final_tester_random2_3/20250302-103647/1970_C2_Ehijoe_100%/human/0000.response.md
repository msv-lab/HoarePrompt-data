```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: In this basic test case, the tree has 5 nodes, and there is only 1 round. The stone starts at node 1. Since the tree is small and the number of rounds is 1, Ron can always win if he plays optimally.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks a linear tree structure. Ron can always win by moving the stone to the adjacent node, and Hermione will have no valid move afterward.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 2, Ron can move the stone to node 1, and then Hermione will be forced to move it to node 3. Ron can then move it to node 4, and Hermione will have no valid move.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
6 1

```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks a slightly larger linear tree. Ron can always win by moving the stone to the adjacent node, ensuring Hermione has no valid move.

# Test 5

```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
3
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 3, Ron can move the stone to node 2, and then Hermione will be forced to move it to node 1. Ron can then move it to node 4, and Hermione will have no valid move.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 2, Ron can move the stone to node 1, and then Hermione will be forced to move it to node 3. Ron can then move it to node 4, and Hermione will have no valid move.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks a star-like tree centered around node 3. Ron can always win by moving the stone to one of the leaf nodes, and Hermione will be forced to move it to another leaf node, leaving Ron with the last move.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
4
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 4, Ron can move the stone to node 3, and then Hermione will be forced to move it to node 2 or node 5. Ron can then move it to node 1, and Hermione will have no valid move.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
6 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6

```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks a more complex tree structure. Ron can always win by moving the stone to one of the leaf nodes, ensuring Hermione has no valid move.

# Test 10

```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks a longer linear tree. Ron can always win by moving the stone to the adjacent node, ensuring Hermione has no valid move.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
3 1
1 2
2 3
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks a simple tree with three nodes. Ron can always win by moving the stone to the other node, and Hermione will have no valid move.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the smallest possible tree with two nodes. Ron can always win by moving the stone to the other node, and Hermione will have no valid move.
