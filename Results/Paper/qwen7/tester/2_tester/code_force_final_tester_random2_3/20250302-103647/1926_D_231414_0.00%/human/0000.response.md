# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 4 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: In this case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so each number must be in its own group.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The binary representations are `00000000000000000000000000000000` and `11111111111111111111111111111111`, which are complements of each other. They can be placed in the same group.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```

5
476319172 261956880 2136179468 1671164475 1885526767
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The numbers have different combinations of bits, and they cannot all fit into fewer than three groups.

# Test 4
**Input**:

3
1335890506 811593141 1128223362
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The numbers can be divided into two groups based on their bit patterns.

4
688873446 627404104 1520079543 1458610201
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The numbers can be divided into two groups based on their bit patterns.

```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The numbers have different combinations of bits, and they cannot all fit into fewer than three groups.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 0 2147483647 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Two zeros can be in the same group, and the two ones can be in another group.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Two zeros can be in the same group, and the one can be in another group.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```

1858058912 289424735 1858058912 2024818580 1858058912 289424735 122665067 289424735
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The numbers have different combinations of bits, and they cannot all fit into fewer than four groups.

These test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the solution's robustness and reliability.
