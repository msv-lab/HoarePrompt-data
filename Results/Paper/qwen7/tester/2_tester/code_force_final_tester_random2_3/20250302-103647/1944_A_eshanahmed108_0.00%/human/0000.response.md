# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: No bridges can be destroyed, so all islands are reachable.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: One bridge can be destroyed. Destroying the bridge between islands 1 and 2 ensures that Everule cannot visit island 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: With one bridge, it is possible to ensure that Everule can still visit all islands. For instance, destroying the bridge between islands 1 and 2, Everule can still visit all islands through alternative routes.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Since k is equal to the maximum number of bridges, all bridges can be destroyed. Thus, Everule can only visit island 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: With three bridges, it is optimal to destroy bridges in such a way that all islands remain reachable. For example, destroying bridges between islands 1-2, 1-3, and 1-4 ensures all islands are still reachable.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Four bridges can be destroyed, which means all bridges can be removed. Therefore, Everule can only visit island 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
3 1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
```
*Explanation*: For the first case, destroying one bridge ensures Everule can only visit two islands. For the second case, destroying two bridges ensures Everule can only visit two islands.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
3 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
*Explanation*: In both cases, all bridges can be destroyed, leaving Everule to visit only island 1.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
6 5
6 15
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
*Explanation*: In the first case, five bridges can be destroyed, which means all bridges except one can be removed, still allowing Everule to visit all islands. In the second case, all bridges can be destroyed, leaving Everule to visit only island 1.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
3
1 0
1 1
10 45
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
10
```
*Explanation*: In the first case, no bridges can be destroyed, so Everule can visit all islands. In the second case, one bridge can be destroyed, but it doesn't affect the connectivity. In the third case, all bridges can be destroyed, leaving Everule to visit only island 1.
