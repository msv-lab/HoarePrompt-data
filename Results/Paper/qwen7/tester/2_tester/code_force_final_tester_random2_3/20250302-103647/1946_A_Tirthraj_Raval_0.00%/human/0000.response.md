# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [2, 2, 8] is 2. After one operation on the first element, the array becomes [3, 2, 8], and the median is 3, which is greater than 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
7 3 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [7, 3, 3, 1] is 3. After two operations on the last two elements, the array becomes [7, 3, 3, 2], and the median is 3, which is greater than 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The array has only one element, so no operations are needed to change its median since there is no other element to compare.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5. After three operations on the last four elements, the array becomes [5, 5, 5, 6, 6], and the median is 5, which remains unchanged but we need to perform the minimum operations to make sure the median increases if possible.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
2 1 2 3 1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2. After two operations on the first two elements, the array becomes [3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4], and the median is 2, which is greater than 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1, 2] is 1. After one operation on the first element, the array becomes [2, 2], and the median is 2, which is greater than 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1, 1] is 1. After two operations on the first two elements, the array becomes [2, 2], and the median is 2, which is greater than 1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The array has all elements equal, so no operations are needed to change its median since it is already the maximum possible value.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] is 4. After three operations on the first three elements, the array becomes [4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7], and the median is 4, which remains unchanged but we need to perform the minimum operations to make sure the median increases if possible.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
8
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] is 1. After seven operations on the first seven elements, the array becomes [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], and the median is 1, which is greater than 1.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] is 5. After five operations on the first five elements, the array becomes [6, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and the median is 5, which remains unchanged but we need to perform the minimum operations to make sure the median increases if possible.
