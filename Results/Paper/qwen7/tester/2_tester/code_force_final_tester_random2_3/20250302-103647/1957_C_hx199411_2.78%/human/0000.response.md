To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the test cases:

### Test 1: Small Board with Few Moves
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly for a small board with a few moves.

**Input**:
```
1
4 1
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The board is 4x4, and you have made one move placing a white rook at (1, 2). The computer mirrored this move by placing a black rook at (2, 1). From this state, there are 3 possible final configurations as explained in the example.

### Test 2: Medium Board with Few Moves
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly for a medium-sized board with a few moves.

**Input**:
```
1
8 1
7 6
```
**Output**:
```
331
```
**Explanation**: The board is 8x8, and you have made one move placing a white rook at (7, 6). The computer mirrored this move by placing a black rook at (6, 7). The number of possible final configurations is 331.

### Test 3: Large Board with Few Moves
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly for a large board with a few moves.

**Input**:
```
1
1000 1
4 4
```
**Output**:
```
671968183
```
**Explanation**: The board is 1000x1000, and you have made one move placing a white rook at (4, 4). The computer mirrored this move by placing a black rook at (4, 4). The number of possible final configurations is 671968183.

### Test 4: Small Board with Many Moves
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly for a small board with many moves.

**Input**:
```
1
4 3
1 2
2 3
3 4
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The board is 4x4, and you have made three moves placing white rooks at (1, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 4). The computer mirrored these moves by placing black rooks at (2, 1), (3, 2), and (4, 3). After these moves, there is only one possible final configuration.

### Test 5: Medium Board with Many Moves
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly for a medium-sized board with many moves.

**Input**:
```
1
8 4
7 6
6 5
5 4
4 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The board is 8x8, and you have made four moves placing white rooks at (7, 6), (6, 5), (5, 4), and (4, 3). The computer mirrored these moves by placing black rooks at (6, 7), (5, 6), (4, 5), and (3, 4). After these moves, there is only one possible final configuration.

### Test 6: Large Board with Many Moves
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly for a large board with many moves.

**Input**:
```
1
1000 4
4 4
952 343
222 333
90 91
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The board is 1000x1000, and you have made four moves placing white rooks at (4, 4), (952, 343), (222, 333), and (90, 91). The computer mirrored these moves by placing black rooks at (4, 4), (343, 952), (333, 222), and (91, 90). After these moves, there is only one possible final configuration.

### Test 7: Small Board with No Moves
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly for a small board with no moves.

**Input**:
```
1
4 0
```
**Output**:
```
16
```
**Explanation**: The board is 4x4, and you have made zero moves. There are 16 possible initial configurations (each cell can either have a white rook, a black rook, or neither).

### Test 8: Medium Board with No Moves
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly for a medium-sized board with no moves.

**Input**:
```
1
8 0
```
**Output**:
```
256
```
**Explanation**: The board is 8x8, and you have made zero moves. There are 256 possible initial configurations (each cell can either have a white rook, a black rook, or neither).

### Test 9: Large Board with No Moves
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly for a large board with no moves.

**Input**:
```
1
1000 0
```
**Output**:
```
1000000000
```
**Explanation**: The board is 1000x1000, and you have made zero moves. There are 1,000,000,000 possible initial configurations (each cell can either have a white rook, a black rook, or neither).

### Test 10: Maximum Board Size with No Moves
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly for the maximum board size with no moves.

**Input**:
```
1
300000 0
```
**Output**:
```
900000000000000
```
**Explanation**: The board is 300,000x300,000, and you have made zero moves. There are 900,000,000,000,000 possible initial configurations (each cell can either have a white rook, a black rook, or neither).

### Test 11: Maximum Board Size with Maximum Moves
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly for the maximum board size with the maximum number of moves.

**Input**:
```
1
300000 300000
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The board is 300,000x300,000, and you have made 300,000 moves. After these moves, there is only one possible final configuration because every cell is occupied by either a white or a black rook.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the function behaves correctly under various conditions.
