# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: k must be in the range [3, 10] and cannot be 1 or 5. Thus, the valid values are 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 5
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: k must be at least 5 and at most 4, which is impossible. Hence, no valid k exists.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10
3 6
3 7
1 2
1 7
3 100
3 44
2 100
2 98
1 3
3 99
```
**Output**: 
```
90
```
**Explanation**: The valid range for k is [2, 98] excluding 3, 6, 7, 44, 99, and 100. This leaves us with 90 possible values.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: k cannot be 1 and 2, which means there are no valid k values.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: k must be at least 1 and at most 2, but it cannot be 1 and 2 simultaneously, making it impossible.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 5
2 10
1 9
2 2
3 2
3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: k must be in the range [5, 10] and [9, 2], which is impossible. No valid k exists.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1
2 2
3 1
3 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: k must be at least 1 and at most 2, but it cannot be 1, 2, or 3, making it impossible.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 10000
2 900000000
3 500000000
1 100000000
3 10000
3 900000001
```
**Output**: 
```
800000000
```
**Explanation**: The valid range for k is [10000, 900000000] excluding 500000000, 100000000, and 900000001. This leaves us with 800000000 possible values.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: This is a duplicate of Test 1, ensuring consistency in results.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
