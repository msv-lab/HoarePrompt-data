# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when there are enough problems in the bank to cover all required difficulties for one round.
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
BGECDCBDED
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The bank already contains all necessary difficulties ('A' to 'G') for one round, so no additional problems need to be created.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when there are enough problems in the bank to cover all required difficulties for multiple rounds.
**Input**: 
```

10 2
BGECDCBDED
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The bank contains 'B', 'G', 'E', 'C', and 'D'. For two rounds, we need at least one 'A', one 'F', and one 'B', 'G', 'E', 'C', 'D' each. So, we need to create one 'A', one 'F', and one each of 'B', 'G', 'E', 'C', 'D', but since 'B', 'G', 'E', 'C', 'D' are already available, only one 'A' and one 'F' need to be created, making the total 4.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the bank does not have enough problems to cover all required difficulties for one round.
**Input**: 
```

BBCDEFFGG
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The bank contains 'B', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'G', 'G'. We need at least one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', one 'D', one 'E', one 'F', and one 'G'. Since 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G' are missing, we need to create three problems ('A', 'F', and 'G').

7
```
**Explanation**: For two rounds, we need at least one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', one 'D', one 'E', one 'F', and one 'G'. Since 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G' are missing, we need to create seven problems ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G').

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the bank has exactly the required problems for one round.
**Input**: 
```
1
7 1
ABCDEF
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The bank contains exactly one problem of each difficulty level needed for one round, so no additional problems need to be created.

ABCDEF
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: For two rounds, we need at least one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', one 'D', one 'E', and one 'F'. Since 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', and 'F' are already available, we need to create one 'G' to cover the second round.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the bank has fewer than the required problems for one round.
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
A
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: The bank contains only one 'A'. For one round, we need at least one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', one 'D', one 'E', and one 'F', 'G'. So, we need to create six more problems ('B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G').

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the bank has fewer than the required problems for multiple rounds.
**Input**: 
```
1

A
```
**Output**: 
```
12
```
**Explanation**: For two rounds, we need at least one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', one 'D', one 'E', one 'F', and one 'G'. Since 'A' is available, we need to create eleven more problems ('B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G').

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the bank has exactly the required problems for one round but in a different order.
**Input**: 
```

DEFABC
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The bank contains exactly one problem of each difficulty level needed for one round, so no additional problems need to be created.

```
**Explanation**: For two rounds, we need at least one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', one 'D', one 'E', and one 'F'. Since 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', and 'F' are already available, we need to create one 'G' to cover the second round.

# Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the bank has some but not all required problems for one round.
**Input**: 
```

ABCFEG
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The bank contains 'A', 'B', 'C', 'F', 'E', and 'G'. We need at least one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', one 'D', one 'E', and one 'F', 'G'. Since 'D' is missing, we need to create one 'D'. Additionally, we need one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', one 'E', and one 'F', 'G' which are already available, so the total is 2.

# Test 12
