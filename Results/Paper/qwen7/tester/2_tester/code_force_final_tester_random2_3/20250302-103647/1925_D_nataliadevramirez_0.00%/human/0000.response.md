# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
100 0 24
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: There are no pairs of friends, so the friendship value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the friendship value for all excursions is 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
*Explanation*: There is only one pair (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1. Each excursion increases the friendship value by 1, so after 24 excursions, the total sum is \(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 24 = 300 / 2 = 156\), but since we need the expected value for each excursion, the answer is \(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 24 = 55\).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
*Explanation*: There is one pair (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 2. After the first excursion, the friendship value becomes 3. For the second excursion, the probability of choosing the same pair again is 1/3, so the expected value is \(2 \times \frac{1}{3} + 3 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2 + 6}{3} = \frac{8}{3}\). Since the expected value is calculated for each excursion, the total expected value for 2 excursions is \(2 \times \frac{8}{3} = \frac{16}{3}\), but since we need the integer part, the answer is 7.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 4
1 2 25
3 2 24
```
**Output**: 
```
40000020
```
*Explanation*: There are two pairs (1, 2) and (3, 2) with initial friendship values 25 and 24 respectively. The expected value for each excursion is calculated based on the probabilities of choosing each pair. The total expected value for 4 excursions is calculated as follows:

- For pair (1, 2): Expected value per excursion is \(25 + \frac{25}{4} = \frac{125}{4}\)
- For pair (3, 2): Expected value per excursion is \(24 + \frac{24}{4} = \frac{120}{4} = 30\)

Total expected value for 4 excursions is \(4 \times \left(\frac{125}{4} + 30\right) = 125 + 120 = 245\). But since we need the answer modulo \(10^9 + 7\), the result is \(245 \mod (10^9 + 7) = 40000020\).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
*Explanation*: There is one pair (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1000000000. Each excursion increases the friendship value by 1, so after 1 excursion, the total sum is 1000000000.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 1
1 2 1
2 3 1
1 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: There are three pairs (1, 2), (2, 3), and (1, 3) each with an initial friendship value of 1. The expected value for each pair is 1, so the total expected value for 1 excursion is \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4 6 1
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
1 3 1
1 4 1
2 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
*Explanation*: There are six pairs with an initial friendship value of 1. The expected value for each pair is 1, so the total expected value for 1 excursion is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6\).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 9 1
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
4 5 1
5 6 1
6 7 1
7 8 1
8 9 1
9 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
*Explanation*: There are nine pairs with an initial friendship value of 1. The expected value for each pair is 1, so the total expected value for 1 excursion is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9\).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 9 2
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
4 5 1
5 6 1
6 7 1
7 8 1
8 9 1
9 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
18
```
*Explanation*: There are nine pairs with an initial friendship value of 1. The expected value for each pair is 1, so the total expected value for 2 excursions is \(2 \times (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 18\).
