```
1
4
2 4 6 8
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the scenario where the initial array consists of distinct even numbers, and the median operation results in the smallest number being the final result.

```
1
5
1 3 5 7 9
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the initial array consists of distinct odd numbers, and the median operation results in the largest number being the final result.

```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 3 3 7
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the initial array has repeated numbers, but the median operation does not immediately converge to the smallest number.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the scenario where the array is already uniform and no changes are needed.

**Input**: 
```
1
3
10 20 30
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the initial array consists of distinct increasing numbers, and the median operation results in the smallest number being the final result.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the scenario where the initial array is a sequence of consecutive numbers, and the median operation converges to the middle value.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
100 100 100
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the array is uniform with a large number.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the scenario where the initial array is a sequence of consecutive numbers, and the median operation converges to the middle value.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the initial array has repeated pairs of numbers, and the median operation converges to the middle value of the pairs.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the scenario where the initial array consists of distinct odd numbers, and the median operation converges to the largest number being the final result.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the initial array has repeated pairs of numbers, and the median operation converges to the middle value of the pairs.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case is a duplicate of Test 14, ensuring the algorithm handles repeated pairs correctly.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the initial array has repeated groups of numbers, and the median operation converges to the middle value of the groups.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
