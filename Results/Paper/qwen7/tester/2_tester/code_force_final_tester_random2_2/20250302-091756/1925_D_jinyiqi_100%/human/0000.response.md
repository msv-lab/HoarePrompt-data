# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
100 0 24
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: There are no pairs of friends, so the friendship value for all excursions is 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
*Explanation*: There is only one pair (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1. Each excursion increases the friendship value by 1, resulting in the sum of friendship values being \(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 24 = 55\).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
*Explanation*: There is only one pair (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1. The first excursion increases the friendship value to 2, and the second excursion adds another 1, resulting in a total sum of \(1 + 2 = 3\) for the two excursions.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 4
1 2 25
3 2 24
```
**Output**: 
```
40000020
```
*Explanation*: The pair (1, 2) has an initial friendship value of 25, and the pair (3, 2) has an initial friendship value of 24. For each excursion, the friendship value of (1, 2) increases by 1, and the friendship value of (3, 2) increases by 1 if (3, 2) is chosen. The expected value calculation involves the probability of choosing each pair and the increase in friendship value.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000001
```
*Explanation*: There is only one pair (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1000000000. Each excursion increases the friendship value by 1, resulting in the sum of friendship values being \(1000000000 + 1 = 1000000001\).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4 3 3
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
*Explanation*: The pairs (1, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 4) have initial friendship values of 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Each excursion increases the friendship value of the chosen pair by 1. The expected sum of friendship values for the three excursions is calculated based on the probabilities of choosing each pair.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10 9 10
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
4 5 1
5 6 1
6 7 1
7 8 1
8 9 1
9 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
*Explanation*: There are 9 pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value of 1. Each excursion increases the friendship value of the chosen pair by 1. The expected sum of friendship values for the ten excursions is calculated based on the probabilities of choosing each pair.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 9 100
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
4 5 1
5 6 1
6 7 1
7 8 1
8 9 1
9 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5500
```
*Explanation*: There are 9 pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value of 1. Each excursion increases the friendship value of the chosen pair by 1. The expected sum of friendship values for the hundred excursions is calculated based on the probabilities of choosing each pair.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 9 1000
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
4 5 1

7 8 1
8 9 1
9 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
55000
```
*Explanation*: There are 9 pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value of 1. Each excursion increases the friendship value of the chosen pair by 1. The expected sum of friendship values for the thousand excursions is calculated based on the probabilities of choosing each pair.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 9 100000
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1

8 9 1
9 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5500000
```
*Explanation*: There are 9 pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value of 1. Each excursion increases the friendship value of the chosen pair by 1. The expected sum of friendship values for the hundred thousand excursions is calculated based on the probabilities of choosing each pair.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10 0 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: There are no pairs of friends, so the friendship value for all excursions is 0.
