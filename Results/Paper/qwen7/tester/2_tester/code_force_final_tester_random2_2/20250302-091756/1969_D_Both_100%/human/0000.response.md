# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0
2 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the 2-nd item and sell it to Bob, so her profit is \(2 - 1 = 1\).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
1 2 1 4
3 3 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd items; then Bob takes the 1-st item for free and pays for the 2-nd and 3-rd items. Alice's profit is \((3 + 2) - (1 + 2 + 1) = 1\). Bob won't take the 3-rd item for free since this would lead to a profit of 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
2 1 1 1
4 2 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the 1-st, 2-nd, 3-rd, and 4-th items; then Bob takes 2 items for free and pays for the remaining 2 items. The optimal choice for Bob is to take the 1-st and 4-th items for free, and Alice's profit is \((4 + 2) - (2 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 0\).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
1 3 4 9 1 3
7 6 8 10 6 8
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the 1-st, 2-nd, 3-rd, 4-th, 5-th, and 6-th items; then Bob takes 2 items for free and pays for the remaining 4 items. The optimal choice for Bob is to take the 1-st and 4-th items for free, and Alice's profit is \((7 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 6 + 8) - (1 + 3 + 4 + 9 + 1 + 3) = 42 - 23 = 19 - 12 = 7\).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the only item and sell it to Bob, so her profit is \(1 - 1 = 0\).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy both items; then Bob takes 1 item for free and pays for the other. The optimal choice for Bob is to take the 1-st item for free, and Alice's profit is \((1 + 1) - (1 + 1) = 0\).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
10 20 30
5 15 25
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd items; then Bob takes 2 items for free and pays for the remaining 1 item. The optimal choice for Bob is to take the 1-st and 2-nd items for free, and Alice's profit is \((5 + 15 + 25) - (10 + 20 + 30) = 45 - 60 = -15\), but since we are calculating the positive difference, it results in \(10\).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the 1-st, 2-nd, 3-rd, 4-th, and 5-th items; then Bob takes 3 items for free and pays for the remaining 2 items. The optimal choice for Bob is to take the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd items for free, and Alice's profit is \((5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1) - (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) = 15 - 15 = 0\).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```

1 1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the only item; then Bob takes 1 item for free. Alice's profit is \(1 - 1 = 0\).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```

2 2
1 2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy both items; then Bob takes 2 items for free. Alice's profit is \(2 + 1 - (1 + 2) = 3 - 3 = 0\).
