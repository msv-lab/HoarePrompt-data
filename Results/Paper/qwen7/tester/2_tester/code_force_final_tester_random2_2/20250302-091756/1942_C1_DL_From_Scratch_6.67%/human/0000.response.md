To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Hereâ€™s how we can structure the test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test Case 1
**Objective**: Verify the function with a simple polygon with a small number of sides and a few chosen vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides, choosing vertices 1 and 3 allows for only one triangle to be formed.

#### Test Case 2
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is slightly larger and more vertices are chosen.
**Input**:
```
1
5 3 0
1 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With 5 sides, choosing vertices 1, 3, and 4 allows for two triangles to be formed.

#### Test Case 3
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is much larger and fewer vertices are chosen.
**Input**:
```
1
10 2 0
1 5
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 10 sides, choosing vertices 1 and 5 allows for only one triangle to be formed.

#### Test Case 4
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is even and more vertices are chosen.
**Input**:
```
1
6 4 0
1 2 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: With 6 sides, choosing vertices 1, 2, 4, and 5 allows for three triangles to be formed.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test Case 5
**Objective**: Verify the function with the minimum number of sides and vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides, choosing vertices 1 and 2 allows for only one triangle to be formed.

#### Test Case 6
**Objective**: Verify the function with the maximum number of sides and vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 2 0
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 1 billion sides, choosing vertices 1 and 2 allows for only one triangle to be formed.

#### Test Case 7
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is a prime number and a few vertices are chosen.
**Input**:
```
1
7 3 0
1 3 5
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: With 7 sides, choosing vertices 1, 3, and 5 allows for three triangles to be formed.

#### Test Case 8
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is a composite number and a few vertices are chosen.
**Input**:
```
1
8 3 0
1 3 5
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: With 8 sides, choosing vertices 1, 3, and 5 allows for three triangles to be formed.

#### Test Case 9
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is a power of 2 and a few vertices are chosen.
**Input**:
```
1
16 4 0
1 4 8 15
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: With 16 sides, choosing vertices 1, 4, 8, and 15 allows for six triangles to be formed.

#### Test Case 10
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is a large prime number and a few vertices are chosen.
**Input**:
```
1
999999997 3 0
1 3 999999996
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: With 999999997 sides, choosing vertices 1, 3, and 999999996 allows for three triangles to be formed.
