# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes the only element, resulting in a sum of 0.*

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1 1
3 1 2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Alice does not remove any elements, and Bob multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in a sum of 3 + 1 + 2 - 4 = 2.*

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6 3
1 4 3 2 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements, and Bob does not change any elements, resulting in a sum of 0.*

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6 1
3 7 3 3 32 15
```
**Output**: 
```
-9
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements except 3, 3, 3, and Bob multiplies 32 by -1, resulting in a sum of 3 + 3 + 3 - 32 = -23. However, since Bob can only change one element, he changes the largest negative impact, which is 15, to -15, resulting in a sum of 3 + 3 + 3 - 32 + 15 = -9.*

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
8 5 3
5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
-9
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 5, 5, 9, 9, and Bob multiplies 5, 3, 3 by -1, resulting in a sum of 3 + 3 + 3 - 5 - 5 - 5 - 2 - 9 - 9 = -32. However, Bob can only change three elements, so he changes 5, 5, 9 to -5, -5, -9, resulting in a sum of 3 + 3 + 3 - 5 - 5 - 5 - 2 - (-9) - (-9) = -9.*

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10 6 4
1 8 2 9 3 3 4 5 3 200
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 200, 9, 8, 5, 4, 3, and Bob does not change any elements, resulting in a sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 9. However, Bob can only change four elements, so he changes the smallest negative impact, which is 1, 2, 3, 3 to -1, -2, -3, -3, resulting in a sum of 0.*

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 1
4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 4, and Bob multiplies 3 by -1, resulting in a sum of 3 - 3 = 0. However, since Bob can only change one element, he changes the largest negative impact, which is 4, to -4, resulting in a sum of -4 - 3 = -7. But since Alice can only remove two elements, she removes 4 and 3, and Bob changes 3 to -3, resulting in a sum of -3 = -1.*

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-2
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 1, and Bob multiplies 3 by -1, resulting in a sum of -3. However, since Bob can only change two elements, he changes the largest negative impact, which is 3, to -3, resulting in a sum of -3 = -2.*

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
3
1 1 1
1000
4 1 1
1 1 1 1
6 6 3
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
0
```
*Explanation*: In each case, Alice removes the only element, and Bob does not change any elements, resulting in a sum of 0.*

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
8 5 3
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-3
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, and Bob multiplies 1, 1, 1 by -1, resulting in a sum of 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 = -3.*

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 1
-1 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
-2
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes -1, and Bob multiplies -1 by -1, resulting in a sum of -1 - 1 = -2.*

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 2
-1 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
-2
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes -1, and Bob multiplies -1 by -1, resulting in a sum of -1 - 1 = -2.*
