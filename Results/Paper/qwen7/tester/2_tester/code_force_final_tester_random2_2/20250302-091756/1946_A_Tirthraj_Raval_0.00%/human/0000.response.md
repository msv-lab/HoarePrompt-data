# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [2, 2, 8] is 2. After one operation on the first element, the array becomes [3, 2, 8], and the median becomes 3. Thus, the minimum number of operations required is 1.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
7 3 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [7, 3, 3, 1] is 3. After two operations on the last two elements, the array becomes [7, 3, 3, 3], and the median becomes 3. Thus, the minimum number of operations required is 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1000000000] is 1000000000. After one operation on the only element, the array becomes [1000000001], and the median becomes 1000000001. Thus, the minimum number of operations required is 1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5. After three operations on the last four elements, the array becomes [5, 5, 5, 5, 5], and the median becomes 5. Thus, the minimum number of operations required is 3.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
2 1 2 3 1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2. After two operations on the first and third elements, the array becomes [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4], and the median becomes 3. Thus, the minimum number of operations required is 2.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1, 2] is 1. After one operation on the first element, the array becomes [2, 2], and the median becomes 2. Thus, the minimum number of operations required is 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1, 1] is 1. After two operations on both elements, the array becomes [2, 2], and the median becomes 2. Thus, the minimum number of operations required is 2.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 5] is 5. Since all elements are already equal to the median, no operations are needed. Thus, the minimum number of operations required is 0.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
3
1 2 3
3
3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
```
*Explanation*: For the first test case, the median of [1, 2, 3] is 2, which is already the smallest number in the sorted array. No operations are needed. For the second test case, the median of [3, 2, 1] is 2, which is already the largest number in the sorted array. No operations are needed.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
3
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
5 4 3 2 1
5
2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
0
```
*Explanation*: In all three test cases, the median is already the middle value in the sorted array, so no operations are needed to increase the median.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
2
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
6
6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
```
*Explanation*: In both test cases, the median is already the middle value in the sorted array, so no operations are needed to increase the median.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
2
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
7
7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
```
*Explanation*: In both test cases, the median is already the middle value in the sorted array, so no operations are needed to increase the median.
