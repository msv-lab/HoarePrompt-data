# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when there are sufficient problems for all rounds.
**Input**:
```
3
10 1
BGECDCBDED
10 2
BGECDCBDED
10 5
BGECDCBDED
```
**Output**:
```
0
0
0
```
**Explanation**: In all three cases, the bank already has enough problems of all required difficulty levels, so no additional problems need to be created.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when there are insufficient problems for all rounds but can be made sufficient by creating just enough new problems.
**Input**:
```

```
**Output**:
```
1
2
3
```
**Explanation**: In the first case, one 'A' problem needs to be created. In the second case, two 'A' and 'F' problems need to be created. In the third case, three 'A', 'F', and 'G' problems need to be created.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the minimum number of problems in the bank.
**Input**:
```
3
1 1
A
1 2
A
1 5
A
```
**Output**:
```
0
1
4
```
**Explanation**: In the first case, one 'A' problem is available, which is sufficient. In the second case, one 'A' problem is needed. In the third case, four 'A' problems are needed.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the maximum number of problems in the bank.
**Input**:
```

```
**Output**:
```
0
0
0
```
**Explanation**: In all three cases, the bank has 50 problems, which is more than enough to cover all required difficulty levels for the specified number of rounds.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of rounds is less than or equal to the number of unique difficulty levels.
**Input**:
```

```
**Output**:
```
0
0
0
```
**Explanation**: In all three cases, the bank has at least one problem of each difficulty level, so no additional problems need to be created.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of rounds is greater than the number of unique difficulty levels.
**Input**:
```

```
**Explanation**: In the first case, one additional problem is needed. In the second case, two additional problems are needed. In the third case, three additional problems are needed.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of rounds is exactly the same as the number of unique difficulty levels.
**Input**:
```

```
**Explanation**: In all three cases, the bank has at least one problem of each difficulty level, so no additional problems need to be created.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of problems in the bank is zero.
**Input**:
```

```
**Output**:
```
1

```
**Explanation**: In all three cases, one, two, and five additional problems are needed, respectively, to cover the required difficulty levels for the specified number of rounds.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of problems in the bank is one and the number of rounds is one.
**Input**:
```

```
**Explanation**: In all three cases, one problem of the required difficulty level is available, so no additional problems need to be created.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of problems in the bank is one and the number of rounds is greater than one.
**Input**:
```
