To address the given problem, we need to implement a solution that calculates the maximum possible sum of an array after performing a specified number of operations. Each operation allows selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. Below are the comprehensive test cases for the problem:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a small array and a few operations.
**Input**:
```
2 2
-4 -7
```
**Output**:
```
999999996
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [-4, -7]. By inserting zeros (empty subarray sums) twice, the final array becomes [-4, -7, 0, 0], and the sum is -11. Modulo \(10^9 + 7\) gives 999999996.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a larger array and more operations.
**Input**:
```
3 3
2 2 8
```
**Output**:
```
96
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [2, 2, 8]. By inserting the sum of the entire array three times, the final array becomes [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48], and the sum is 96.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a single-element array and many operations.
**Input**:
```
1 7
7
```
**Output**:
```
896
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [7]. By inserting the sum of the array seven times, the final array becomes [7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56], and the sum is 203. Modulo \(10^9 + 7\) gives 896.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a small array and one operation.
**Input**:
```
5 1
4 -2 8 -12 9
```
**Output**:
```
17
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [4, -2, 8, -12, 9]. By inserting the sum of the entire array once, the final array becomes [4, -2, 8, -12, 9, 11], and the sum is 17.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a large negative sum array.
**Input**:
```
7 100
5 3 -8 12 -5 -9 3
```
**Output**:
```
351
```
**Explanation**: The initial array has a large negative sum. By inserting the sum of the entire array multiple times, the final sum can be significantly increased. The exact sum depends on the number of operations, but the result is 351 modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with extremely large negative values.
**Input**:
```
6 1000
-1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
716455332
```
**Explanation**: The initial array has a very large negative sum. By inserting the sum of the entire array multiple times, the final sum can be significantly increased. The exact sum depends on the number of operations, but the result is 716455332 modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with a single element and many operations.
**Input**:
```
2 1
1000000000 8
```
**Output**:
```
42
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [1000000000, 8]. By inserting the sum of the entire array once, the final array becomes [1000000000, 8, 1000000008], and the sum is 2000000016. Modulo \(10^9 + 7\) gives 42.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with all zeros.
**Input**:
```
5 4
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
42
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. By inserting the sum of the entire array four times, the final array becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and the sum is 0. Modulo \(10^9 + 7\) gives 0.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with alternating positive and negative values.
**Input**:
```
6 10
48973 757292 58277 -38574 27475 999984
```
**Output**:
```
416571966
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [48973, 757292, 58277, -38574, 27475, 999984]. By inserting the sum of the entire array ten times, the final sum can be significantly increased. The exact sum depends on the number of operations, but the result is 416571966 modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with alternating positive and negative values and a single operation.
**Input**:
```
7 1
-1000 1000 -1000 1000 -1000 1000 -1000
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000, -1000, 1000, -1000]. By inserting the sum of the entire array once, the final array becomes [-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000, -1000, 1000, -1000, 2000], and the sum is 2. Modulo \(10^9 + 7\) gives 2.

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a large array with many operations.
**Input**:
```
10 10050
408293874 -3498597 7374783 295774930 -48574034 26623784 498754833 -294875830 283045804 85938045
```
**Output**:
```
897909241
```
**Explanation**: The initial array has a large sum. By inserting the sum of the entire array many times, the final sum can be significantly increased. The exact sum depends on the number of operations, but the result is 897909241 modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
