# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands will be reachable.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: You can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2. Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: In this case, even with one bridge destroyed, Everule can still find a path to all islands. For instance, if the bridge between islands 1 and 2 is destroyed, Everule can travel via 1 -> 3 -> 2.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Here, \( k = \frac{5 \cdot (5 - 1)}{2} = 10 \), so all bridges can be destroyed. Therefore, Everule can only visit island 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: With 3 bridges destroyed, it is possible to disconnect all islands from island 1. For example, destroying bridges between 1 and 2, 1 and 3, and 1 and 4 ensures Everule cannot visit any other island.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Destroying 4 bridges out of 6 will ensure that island 1 is disconnected from all other islands.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
3 0
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
2
```
*Explanation*: 
- For the first case, no bridges can be destroyed, so all islands are reachable.
- For the second case, you can destroy 2 bridges to isolate one island from island 1, leaving 2 islands reachable.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
6 5
6 15
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
*Explanation*: 
- For the first case, you can destroy 5 bridges out of 15 to isolate all islands from island 1, leaving only island 1 reachable.
- For the second case, you can destroy all 15 bridges, ensuring that island 1 is the only reachable island.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
3
1 0
2 1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
3
```
*Explanation*: 
- For the first case, with only one island, no bridges can be destroyed, so the answer is 1.
- For the second case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2, leaving only island 1 reachable.
- For the third case, you can destroy all bridges, ensuring that island 1 is the only reachable island.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
3
4 3
5 6
6 10
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1
1
```
*Explanation*: 
- For the first case, you can destroy 3 bridges out of 6 to isolate one island from island 1, leaving 2 islands reachable.
- For the second case, you can destroy 6 bridges out of 10 to isolate all islands from island 1, leaving only island 1 reachable.
- For the third case, you can destroy 10 bridges out of 15 to isolate all islands from island 1, leaving only island 1 reachable.
