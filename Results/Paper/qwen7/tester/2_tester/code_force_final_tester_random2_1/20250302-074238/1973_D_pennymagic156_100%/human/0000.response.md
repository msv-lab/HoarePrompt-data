Given the problem description and the interaction format, here are the comprehensive test cases for the Cat's task. Each test case will cover basic and edge scenarios to ensure the robustness, reliability, and scalability of the solution.

### Test Case 1: Basic Case with k = 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when splitting into 1 subarray.
**Input**:
```
3 1
```
**Output**:
```
! 6
```
Explanation: The function should return the maximum value of the entire array since \( k = 1 \).

### Test Case 2: Basic Case with k = 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when splitting into 2 subarrays.
**Input**:
```
4 2
```
**Output**:
```
? 1 12
? 1 6
? 2 6
? 3 6
? 4 6
! 6
```
Explanation: The function should check if there is a way to split the array into 2 subarrays where each subarray's product of length and maximum value is 6. Since the array could be [6, 1, 1, 1], the function should return 6.

### Test Case 3: Basic Case with k = 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when splitting into 3 subarrays.
**Input**:
```
5 3
```
**Output**:
```
? 1 12
? 1 4
? 2 4
? 3 4
? 4 4
? 5 4
! 4
```
Explanation: The function should check if there is a way to split the array into 3 subarrays where each subarray's product of length and maximum value is 4. Since the array could be [4, 1, 1, 1, 1], the function should return 4.

### Test Case 4: Edge Case with k > n
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where \( k > n \).
**Input**:
```
5 6
```
**Output**:
```
! -1
```
Explanation: Since \( k > n \), it is impossible to split the array into more subarrays than its length. Therefore, the function should return -1.

### Test Case 5: Edge Case with k = 1 and large values
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the array has large values but only one subarray is needed.
**Input**:
```
10 1
```
**Output**:
```
! 100
```
Explanation: The function should return the maximum value of the array since \( k = 1 \). If the array is [100, 1, 1, ..., 1], the function should return 100.

### Test Case 6: Edge Case with k = n and all elements equal
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where all elements are equal and \( k = n \).
**Input**:
```
5 5
```
**Output**:
```
! 5
```
Explanation: Since all elements are equal and \( k = n \), the function should return the maximum value of the array divided by the length of the array. If the array is [5, 5, 5, 5, 5], the function should return 5.

### Test Case 7: Edge Case with k = n and all elements different
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where all elements are different and \( k = n \).
**Input**:
```
5 5
```
**Output**:
```
? 1 5
? 2 4
? 3 3
? 4 2
? 5 1
! 5
```
Explanation: Since all elements are different and \( k = n \), the function should return the maximum value of the array. If the array is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], the function should return 5.

### Test Case 8: Edge Case with k = 1 and all elements equal
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where all elements are equal and \( k = 1 \).
**Input**:
```
5 1
```
**Output**:
```
! 5
```
Explanation: Since all elements are equal and \( k = 1 \), the function should return the maximum value of the array. If the array is [5, 5, 5, 5, 5], the function should return 5.

### Test Case 9: Edge Case with k = 1 and some elements zero
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where some elements are zero and \( k = 1 \).
**Input**:
```
5 1
```
**Output**:
```
? 1 5
? 2 0
? 3 0
? 4 0
? 5 0
! 5
```
Explanation: Since some elements are zero and \( k = 1 \), the function should return the maximum value of the non-zero elements. If the array is [5, 0, 0, 0, 0], the function should return 5.

### Test Case 10: Edge Case with k = 1 and all elements zero
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where all elements are zero and \( k = 1 \).
**Input**:
```
5 1
```
**Output**:
```
! -1
```
Explanation: Since all elements are zero and \( k = 1 \), the function should return -1 because no valid subarray exists.

### Test Case 11: Edge Case with k = n and some elements zero
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where some elements are zero and \( k = n \).
**Input**:
```
5 5
```
**Output**:
```
? 1 5
? 2 0
? 3 0
? 4 0
? 5 0
! 5
```
Explanation: Since some elements are zero and \( k = n \), the function should return the maximum value of the non-zero elements. If the array is [5, 0, 0, 0, 0], the function should return 5.

### Test Case 12: Edge Case with k = n and all elements one
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where all elements are one and \( k = n \).
**Input**:
```
5 5
```
**Output**:
```
! 1
```
Explanation: Since all elements are one and \( k = n \), the function should return 1 because the product of the length and maximum value is always 1. If the array is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], the function should return 1.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
