# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [2, 2, 8] is 2. After one operation on the first element, the array becomes [3, 2, 8], and the median is 3. This is the minimum number of operations needed.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
7 3 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [7, 3, 3, 1] is 3. After two operations, one on the third element and one on the fourth, the array becomes [7, 3, 4, 2], and the median is 3.5. This is the minimum number of operations needed.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1000000000] is 1000000000. After one operation on the only element, the array remains [1000000000], and the median is still 1000000000. No operations are needed since the median is already maximized.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5. After three operations, one on the fourth element, and two on the first elements, the array becomes [7, 5, 5, 5, 5], and the median is 5. This is the minimum number of operations needed.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
2 1 2 3 1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2. After two operations, one on the second element and one on the fourth, the array becomes [2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 4], and the median is 2.5. This is the minimum number of operations needed.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1, 2] is 1.5. After one operation on the first element, the array becomes [2, 2], and the median is 2. This is the minimum number of operations needed.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1, 1] is 1. After two operations, one on each element, the array becomes [2, 2], and the median is 2. This is the minimum number of operations needed.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 5] is 5. Since all elements are already equal to the median, no operations are needed.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
3
3
1 2 3
4
1 2 3 4
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
0
```
*Explanation*: In each case, the array is already sorted, and the median is the middle element. No operations are needed to increase the median.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
3
3
3 2 1
4
4 3 2 1
5
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
4
5
```
*Explanation*: In each case, the array is sorted in descending order. The minimum number of operations needed to make the median the largest element is the number of elements minus one.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
3
3
1 1 1
4
1 1 1 1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
1
```
*Explanation*: In each case, all elements are the same. One operation on any element will make it the new median.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
3
3
1 2 2
4
1 2 2 3
5
1 2 2 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
1
```
*Explanation*: In each case, the array has duplicate elements. One operation on any element will make it the new median.
