# Test 15
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality of the game when the tree is a single node.

**Input**: 
```
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree has only one node, and the stone starts at that node. Since there are no valid moves, Ron cannot make a move and loses the round. However, since there is only one round, Ron wins by default.

# Test 16
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality of the game when the tree is a complete binary tree and the starting node is one of the non-leaf nodes.
