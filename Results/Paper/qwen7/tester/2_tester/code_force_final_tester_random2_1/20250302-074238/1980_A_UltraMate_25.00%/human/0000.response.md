# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when there are enough problems in the bank to cover all required difficulties for a single round.
**Input**: 
```
3
10 1
BGECDCBDED
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The bank already contains all necessary difficulties ('A' to 'G') for one round, so no additional problems are needed.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the bank does not have enough problems but can still cover the required difficulties with minimal additions.
**Input**: 
```
3
10 1
BBCDEFFGG
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The bank lacks 'A' and 'C', so Vlad needs to add at least two problems to cover both 'A' and 'C'.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when there are enough problems in the bank to cover all required difficulties for multiple rounds.
**Input**: 
```

10 2
BGECDCBDED
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The bank lacks 'A', 'C', 'E', and 'F', so Vlad needs to add at least four problems to cover these difficulties for two rounds.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the bank does not have enough problems to cover the required difficulties for multiple rounds and requires significant additions.
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: The bank lacks 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G', so Vlad needs to add at least seven problems to cover all difficulties for two rounds.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario with the minimum number of problems in the bank.
**Input**: 
```

1 1
A
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: The bank only has one problem of difficulty 'A'. Vlad needs to add six more problems to cover 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the number of rounds is less than the number of problem difficulties.
**Input**: 
```

ABCDEF
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The bank already contains all necessary difficulties for five rounds, so no additional problems are needed.

```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The bank already contains all necessary difficulties for two rounds, so no additional problems are needed.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the bank has exactly the right number of problems to cover the required difficulties for multiple rounds, but with different distributions.
**Input**: 
```

**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The bank already contains all necessary difficulties for two rounds, so no additional problems are needed.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the bank has exactly the right number of problems to cover the required difficulties for a single round, but with a very small number of problems.
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The bank only has two problems of difficulties 'A' and 'F'. Vlad needs to add five more problems to cover 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', and 'G'.

# Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the bank has exactly the right number of problems to cover the required difficulties for multiple rounds, but with a very small number of problems.
**Input**: 
```

```
4
```
**Explanation**: The bank only has three problems of difficulties 'A', 'B', and 'C'. Vlad needs to add four more problems to cover 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G' for two rounds.

# Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the bank has exactly the right number of problems to cover the required difficulties for a single round, but with a very small number of problems, and the number of rounds is greater than the number of problem difficulties.
