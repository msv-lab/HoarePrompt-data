# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when `n` and `k` are at their minimum values.
**Input**: 
```
2
2 2
6 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
5
2 3 4 5 6
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the first test case, `n = 2` and `k = 2`. The smallest possible sequence that satisfies the conditions is `[1]`.
- For the second test case, `n = 6` and `k = 1`. The sequence `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` ensures no subsequence sums to 1, and every number from 2 to 6 has a subsequence that sums to it.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the maximum value of `n` within the constraints.
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1000000
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the test case, `n = 1000000` and `k = 1000000`. The smallest possible sequence that satisfies the conditions is `[1000000]`.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where `n` is slightly larger than `k`.
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4
```
**Output**: 
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the test case, `n = 5` and `k = 4`. The sequence `[1, 2, 3]` ensures no subsequence sums to 4, and subsequences summing to 1, 2, 3 exist.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where `n` is exactly one more than `k`.
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the test case, `n = 3` and `k = 2`. The sequence `[1, 2]` ensures no subsequence sums to 2, and subsequences summing to 1 and 3 exist.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where `n` is much larger than `k`.
**Input**: 
```
1
100 10
```
**Output**: 
```
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the test case, `n = 100` and `k = 10`. The sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` ensures no subsequence sums to 10, and subsequences summing to 1 through 9 and 11 through 100 exist.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where `n` is a power of 2.
**Input**: 
```
1
8 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
1 2 4 8
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the test case, `n = 8` and `k = 4`. The sequence `[1, 2, 4, 8]` ensures no subsequence sums to 4, and subsequences summing to 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 exist.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where `n` is odd and close to a power of 2.
**Input**: 
```
1
9 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
1 2 4 7
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the test case, `n = 9` and `k = 4`. The sequence `[1, 2, 4, 7]` ensures no subsequence sums to 4, and subsequences summing to 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 exist.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where `n` is a large prime number.
**Input**: 
```
1
101 50
```
**Output**: 
```
50
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the test case, `n = 101` and `k = 50`. The sequence `[1, 2, 3, ..., 50]` ensures no subsequence sums to 50, and subsequences summing to 1 through 49 and 51 through 101 exist.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where `n` is a large composite number.
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 500
```
**Output**: 
```
500
1 2 3 4 ... 500
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the test case, `n = 1000` and `k = 500`. The sequence `[1, 2, 3, ..., 500]` ensures no subsequence sums to 500, and subsequences summing to 1 through 499 and 501 through 1000 exist.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where `n` is a large even number.
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 500000
```
**Output**: 
```
500000
1 2 3 4 ... 500000
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the test case, `n = 1000000` and `k = 500000`. The sequence `[1, 2, 3, ..., 500000]` ensures no subsequence sums to 500000, and subsequences summing to 1 through 499999 and 500001 through 1000000 exist.
