**Explanation**: For `n = 47` and `k = 92`, the only subsequence that needs to be avoided is one that sums to `92`. A sequence `[1, 91, 1]` ensures that no subsequence sums to `92` while still allowing all other sums from `1` to `47` to be formed.

# Test 55
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with `n` equal to `k + 46`.
**Input**: 
```
