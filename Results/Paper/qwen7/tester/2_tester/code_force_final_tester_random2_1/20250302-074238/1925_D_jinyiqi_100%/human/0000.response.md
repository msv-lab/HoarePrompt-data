# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
100 0 24
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: There are no pairs of friends, so the friendship value for all excursions is 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
*Explanation*: There is only one pair (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1. Each excursion increases the friendship value by 1, resulting in the sum \(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 10 = 55\).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
36
```
*Explanation*: There is only one pair (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1. The friendship value increases by 1 for each of the two excursions, resulting in the sum \(1 + 2 = 3\). Since there are two excursions, the total sum is \(3 \times 12 = 36\).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 4
1 2 25
3 2 24
```
**Output**: 
```
40000020
```
*Explanation*: The pairs (1, 2) and (3, 2) have initial friendship values of 25 and 24, respectively. The friendship values increase by 1 for each excursion. The total sum is calculated as follows: \(25 + 26 + 27 + 28 + 24 + 25 + 26 + 27 = 208\). Since there are four excursions, the total sum is \(208 \times 100000 = 40000020\).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
*Explanation*: There is only one pair (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1000000000. The friendship value increases by 1 for each excursion, resulting in the sum \(1000000000\).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4 3 3
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
36
```
*Explanation*: The pairs (1, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 4) have initial friendship values of 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The friendship values increase by 1 for each of the three excursions. The total sum is calculated as follows: \(1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 36\).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 1
1 2 1
2 3 2
1 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
*Explanation*: The pairs (1, 2), (2, 3), and (1, 3) have initial friendship values of 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The friendship value increases by 1 for each of the single excursion. The total sum is calculated as follows: \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: There are no pairs of friends, so the friendship value for all excursions is 0.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 9 1
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
4 5 1
5 6 1
6 7 1
7 8 1
8 9 1
9 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: There are 10 pairs, each with an initial friendship value of 1. The friendship value increases by 1 for each of the single excursion. The total sum is calculated as follows: \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55 / 5 = 10\).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```

9 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
110
```
*Explanation*: There are 10 pairs, each with an initial friendship value of 1. The friendship value increases by 1 for each of the two excursions. The total sum is calculated as follows: \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 110\).
