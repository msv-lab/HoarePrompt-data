# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when there are enough problems in the bank to cover all required rounds.
**Input**:
```
3
10 1
BGECDCBDED
10 2
BGECDCBDED
9 1
BBCDEFFGG
```
**Output**:
```
0
2
1
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the first test case, there are 10 problems and only 1 round needed, so no additional problems are needed.
- For the second test case, there are 10 problems but 2 rounds needed. We need 2 more problems ('A' and 'F') to cover both rounds.
- For the third test case, there are 9 problems and only 1 round needed, but we need at least one 'A' which is missing, so we need to add 1 problem.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the number of required rounds is greater than the number of available problems.
**Input**:
```
1
5 6
ABCDEF
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: 
- There are 5 problems but 6 rounds are needed. We need 6 different difficulty levels, but we are missing one, so we need to add 4 more problems.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the number of problems in the bank is less than the number of required rounds.
**Input**:
```
1
2 5
AB
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: 
- There are only 2 problems but 5 rounds are needed. We need 5 different difficulty levels, but we are missing 5 - 2 = 3 levels, so we need to add 3 more problems.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the bank contains only one type of problem.
**Input**:
```
1
7 1
AAAAAAA
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- There are 7 problems all of the same difficulty level 'A'. Since only 1 round is needed, no additional problems are needed.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the bank contains only a few types of problems.
**Input**:
```
1
3 2
ABC
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: 
- There are 3 problems of different difficulty levels 'A', 'B', and 'C'. But since 2 rounds are needed, we need an additional problem of any difficulty level to cover the last round.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the bank contains a mix of problems but still requires additional problems.
**Input**:
```
1
8 3
ABCDEFAB
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- There are 8 problems with difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', and 'F'. But since 3 rounds are needed, we need 2 more problems ('G' and one of the missing levels).

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the bank contains exactly the right mix of problems.
**Input**:
```
1
7 2
ABCDEFB
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- There are 7 problems with difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'B'. Since 2 rounds are needed and the bank already has all necessary levels, no additional problems are needed.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the bank contains a mix of problems but one level is missing.
**Input**:
```
1
6 2
ABCDEF
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: 
- There are 6 problems with difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', and 'F'. But since 2 rounds are needed, we need an additional problem of any difficulty level to cover the last round.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the bank contains a mix of problems but multiple levels are missing.
**Input**:
```
1
4 3
ABCD
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: 
- There are 4 problems with difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'. But since 3 rounds are needed, we need 3 more problems ('E', 'F', and 'G') to cover the last round.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the bank contains a mix of problems but some levels are repeated.
**Input**:
```
1
10 2
ABCDDCBA
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: 
- There are 10 problems with difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D' (with some repetitions). But since 2 rounds are needed, we need an additional problem of any missing difficulty level to cover the last round.

# Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the bank contains a mix of problems but one level is missing and the number of rounds is large.
**Input**:
```
1
10 5
ABCDEFABC
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- There are 10 problems with difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', and 'F'. But since 5 rounds are needed, we need 2 more problems ('G' and one of the missing levels) to cover the last rounds.

# Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the bank contains a mix of problems but all levels are present and the number of rounds is small.
**Input**:
```
1
7 1
ABCDEFB
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- There are 7 problems with difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'B'. Since only 1 round is needed, no additional problems are needed.
