# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes the only element, making the sum 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1 1
3 1 2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Alice does not remove any elements. Bob multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in the sum being 3 + 1 + 2 - 4 = 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6 3
1 4 3 2 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements. Bob then multiplies 1, 4, and 3 by -1, resulting in the sum being 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6 1
3 7 3 3 32 15
```
**Output**: 
```
-9
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements except one. Bob multiplies 32 by -1, resulting in the sum being 3 + 7 + 3 + 3 + 15 - 32 = -9.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
8 5 3
5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
-9
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 5, 5, 3, 3, and 9. Bob multiplies 5, 3, and 3 by -1, resulting in the sum being 3 + 2 - 5 - 5 - 3 - 3 - 9 = -23, but since we only consider the remaining elements, the sum is 3 + 2 - 5 - 5 - 3 - 3 = -9.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10 6 4
1 8 2 9 3 3 4 5 3 200
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 200, 9, 8, 5, 4, and 3. Bob multiplies 1, 2, 3, and 3 by -1, resulting in the sum being 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 1
4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 4. Bob multiplies 3 by -1, resulting in the sum being 4 + 3 - 3 = 4, but since we consider the remaining elements, the sum is 4 - 3 = 1, but due to the nature of the problem, the closest achievable sum is -1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-2
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 1. Bob multiplies 3 by -1, resulting in the sum being 1 + 3 - 3 = 1, but since we consider the remaining elements, the sum is 1 - 3 = -2.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
8 5 3
5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
-9
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 5, 5, 3, 3, and 9. Bob multiplies 5, 3, and 3 by -1, resulting in the sum being 3 + 2 - 5 - 5 - 3 - 3 - 9 = -23, but considering the remaining elements, the sum is 3 + 2 - 5 - 5 - 3 - 3 = -9.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 6 4
1 8 2 9 3 3 4 5 3 200
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 200, 9, 8, 5, 4, and 3. Bob multiplies 1, 2, 3, and 3 by -1, resulting in the sum being 0.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 1000. The sum becomes 0.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 1. Bob multiplies 1 by -1, resulting in the sum being 1 + 1 - 1 = 1, but since we consider the remaining elements, the sum is 1 - 1 = 0.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements. Bob does nothing, so the sum is 0.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 1000. The sum becomes 0.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes both elements. Bob does nothing, so the sum is 0.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements. Bob does nothing, so the sum is 0.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes -1. The sum becomes 0.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
-1000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes -1000. The sum becomes 0.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
-1 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes -1. Bob multiplies -1 by -1, resulting in the sum being -1 + -1 + 1 = -1, but since we consider the remaining elements, the sum is -1 + 1 = 0.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2
-1 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes both elements. Bob does nothing, so the sum is 0.
