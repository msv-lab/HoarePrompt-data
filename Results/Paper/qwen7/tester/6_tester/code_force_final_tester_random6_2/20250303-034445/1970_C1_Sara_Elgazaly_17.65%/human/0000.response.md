# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a simple tree structure and a single round.

**Input**: 
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path with nodes 1, 2, and 3. Ron starts with the stone on node 3. Since node 3 has only one inactive neighbor (node 2), Ron moves the stone to node 2, making it active. Hermione then has no valid move, so she loses. Hence, Ron wins.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a more complex tree structure and a single round.

**Input**: 
```
5 1
1 2
2 3

4 5
5
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a path with nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Hermione starts with the stone on node 5. She can move the stone to node 4, making it active. Ron then moves the stone to node 3, making it active. Hermione then moves the stone to node 2, making it active. Ron finally moves the stone to node 1, making it active. Hermione then has no valid move, so she loses. Hence, Ron wins, but since Hermione started, she loses.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a tree where Ron starts at a leaf node.

**Input**: 
```
4 1

4
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a path with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Ron starts with the stone on node 4. He can move the stone to node 3, making it active. Hermione then has no valid move, so she loses. Hence, Ron wins.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a tree where Hermione starts at a leaf node.

**Input**: 
```

**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a path with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Hermione starts with the stone on node 3. She can move the stone to node 2, making it active. Ron then moves the stone to node 1, making it active. Hermione then has no valid move, so she loses. Hence, Ron wins, but since Hermione started, she loses.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a tree where Ron starts at a non-leaf node.

**Input**: 
```
4 1
1 2
2 3

```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a path with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Ron starts with the stone on node 2. He can move the stone to node 1, making it active. Hermione then has no valid move, so she loses. Hence, Ron wins.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a tree where Hermione starts at a non-leaf node.

```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a path with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Hermione starts with the stone on node 1. She can move the stone to node 2, making it active. Ron then moves the stone to node 3, making it active. Hermione then moves the stone to node 4, making it active. Ron then has no valid move, so he loses. Hence, Hermione wins.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a tree where Ron starts at the root node.

**Input**: 
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a path with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Ron starts with the stone on node 1. He can move the stone to node 2, making it active. Hermione then moves the stone to node 3, making it active. Ron then moves the stone to node 4, making it active. Hermione then has no valid move, so she loses. Hence, Ron wins, but since Hermione started, she loses.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a tree where Hermione starts at the root node.

**Input**:

3 4
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a path with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Hermione starts with the stone on node 2. She can move the stone to node 1, making it active. Ron then has no valid move, so he loses. Hence, Hermione wins.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a tree where Ron starts at one of the leaves and the tree has a different structure.

**Input**: 
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a path with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Ron starts with the stone on node 4. He can move the stone to node 3, making it active. Hermione then has no valid move, so she loses. Hence, Ron wins.

# Test 10

```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a path with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Hermione starts with the stone on node 3. She can move the stone to node 2, making it active. Ron then moves the stone to node 1, making it active. Hermione then has no valid move, so she loses. Hence, Ron wins, but since Hermione started, she loses.
