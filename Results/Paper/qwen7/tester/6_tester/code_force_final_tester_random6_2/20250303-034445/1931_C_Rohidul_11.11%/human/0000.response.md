# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: We can change the subarray from index 2 to 4 to value 8, resulting in the array [1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1]. Then, we can change the subarray from index 5 to 6 to value 8, resulting in the array [1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]. The total cost is (4 - 2 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 4.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: All elements are already the same, so no operations are needed.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
8
8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: We can change the subarray from index 3 to 3 to value 8, and then change the subarray from index 4 to 5 to value 8, resulting in the array [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]. The total cost is (3 - 3 + 1) + (5 - 4 + 1) = 2.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: There is only one element, which is already the same, so no operations are needed.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: We can change the subarray from index 2 to 2 to value 1, resulting in the array [1, 1]. The total cost is (2 - 2 + 1) = 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: We can change the subarray from index 1 to 1 to value 2, then from index 2 to 2 to value 3, and finally from index 3 to 3 to value 2, resulting in the array [2, 3, 2]. The total cost is (1 - 1 + 1) + (2 - 2 + 1) + (3 - 3 + 1) = 3.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
7
4 3 2 7 1 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
*Explanation*: We can change the subarray from index 1 to 3 to value 2, then from index 4 to 4 to value 1, and finally from index 5 to 7 to value 3, resulting in the array [2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3]. The total cost is (3 - 1 + 1) + (4 - 4 + 1) + (7 - 5 + 1) = 6.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
9
9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
*Explanation*: We can change the subarray from index 3 to 3 to value 9, then from index 4 to 4 to value 9, and finally from index 8 to 9 to value 5, resulting in the array [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5]. The total cost is (3 - 3 + 1) + (4 - 4 + 1) + (9 - 8 + 1) = 7.

These test cases cover basic scenarios where the array has varying initial values and lengths, as well as edge cases where the array might be uniform or very small.
