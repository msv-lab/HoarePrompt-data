**Output**: 
```
10

*Explanation*: We can buy up to 10 cards of any type. Since there is only one type of card initially, we can buy 10 cards of type 1, resulting in a final array of `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. This array has 10 subarrays consisting of a permutation of `[1]`.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 4
8 4
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
*Explanation*: We can buy up to 4 additional cards. One optimal solution is to buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`. This array has 8 subarrays equal to `[1, 2]` and 7 subarrays equal to `[2, 1]`, totaling 15 subarrays which are permutations of `[1, 2]`.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4
6 1 8
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
*Explanation*: We can buy up to 4 additional cards. One optimal solution is to buy 1 card of type 1 and 3 cards of type 2, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`. This array has 8 subarrays equal to `[1, 2]` and 7 subarrays equal to `[2, 1]`, totaling 15 subarrays which are permutations of `[1, 2]`.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```

3 9
7 6 2
```
**Output**: 
```
28
```
*Explanation*: We can buy up to 9 additional cards. One optimal solution is to buy 2 cards of type 1 and 7 cards of type 2, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`. This array has 8 subarrays equal to `[1, 2]` and 7 subarrays equal to `[2, 1]`, totaling 15 subarrays which are permutations of `[1, 2]`. Additionally, we can add more cards to maximize the permutations, leading to a total of 28 subarrays.

*Explanation*: We can buy up to 3 additional cards. One optimal solution is to buy 1 card of type 1, 1 card of type 2, and 1 card of type 3, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 4, 6]`. This array can be rearranged to have 12 subarrays equal to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, 10 subarrays equal to `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, and 2 subarrays equal to `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, totaling 22 subarrays which are permutations of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

*Explanation*: We can buy up to 7 additional cards. One optimal solution is to buy 2 cards of type 1, 2 cards of type 2, and 3 cards of type 3, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. This array can be rearranged to have 7 subarrays equal to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, 7 subarrays equal to `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1]`, 7 subarrays equal to `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2]`, 7 subarrays equal to `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3]`, and 2 subarrays equal to `[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, totaling 32 subarrays which are permutations of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.

*Explanation*: We can buy up to 8 additional cards. One optimal solution is to buy 2 cards of type 1, 2 cards of type 2, 2 cards of type 3, and 2 cards of type 4, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. This array can be rearranged to have 9 subarrays equal to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, 8 subarrays equal to `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1]`, 7 subarrays equal to `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2]`, 6 subarrays equal to `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3]`, 5 subarrays equal to `[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, 4 subarrays equal to `[6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, 3 subarrays equal to `[7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, 2 subarrays equal to `[8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, and 1 subarray equal to `[9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, totaling 36 subarrays which are permutations of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.
