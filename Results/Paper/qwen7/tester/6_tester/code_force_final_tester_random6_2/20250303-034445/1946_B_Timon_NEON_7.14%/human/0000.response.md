To address the given problem, we need to implement a solution that maximizes the sum of the array after performing up to `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. Here are the comprehensive test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a small array and a small number of operations.
**Input**:
```
2 2
-4 -7
```
**Output**:
```
999999996
```
**Explanation**: By inserting zeros, the sum becomes -11, which modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is 999999996.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a larger array and a small number of operations.
**Input**:
```
3 3
2 2 8
```
**Output**:
```
96
```
**Explanation**: Inserting the sum of the entire array three times results in the array `[2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48]`, and the sum is 96.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a single element array and a large number of operations.
**Input**:
```
1 7
7
```
**Output**:
```
896
```
**Explanation**: Inserting the sum of the entire array seven times results in the array `[7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56]`, and the sum is 280, which modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is 896.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a larger array and a single operation.
**Input**:
```
5 1
4 -2 8 -12 9
```
**Output**:
```
17
```
**Explanation**: Taking the subarray `[4, -2, 8]` and inserting its sum (10) results in the array `[4, -2, 8, 10, -12, 9]`, and the sum is 17.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the array has negative elements and a large number of operations.
**Input**:
```
7 100
5 3 -8 12 -5 -9 3
```
**Output**:
```
351
```
**Explanation**: Inserting the sum of the entire array 100 times results in a large positive sum, which modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is 351.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the array contains extremely large negative numbers.
**Input**:
```
6 1000
-1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
716455332
```
**Explanation**: Inserting the sum of the entire array 1000 times results in a large positive sum, which modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is 716455332.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the array contains a single large positive number and a single operation.
**Input**:
```
2 1
1000000000 8
```
**Output**:
```
42
```
**Explanation**: Inserting the sum of the entire array once results in the array `[1000000000, 8, 1000000008]`, and the sum is 2000000016, which modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is 42.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the array contains multiple zeros and a single operation.
**Input**:
```
5 4
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
42
```
**Explanation**: Inserting the sum of the entire array four times results in the array `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, and the sum is 0, which modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is 0.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the array contains a mix of positive and negative numbers and a single operation.
**Input**:
```
6 10
48973 757292 58277 -38574 27475 999984
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Inserting the sum of the entire array once results in the array `[48973, 757292, 58277, -38574, 27475, 999984, 1880223]`, and the sum is 2880223, which modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is 2.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the array contains a mix of positive and negative numbers and a large number of operations.
**Input**:
```
7 1
-1000 1000 -1000 1000 -1000 1000 -1000
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Inserting the sum of the entire array once results in the array `[-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000, -1000, 1000, -1000, 0]`, and the sum is 0.

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the array is very large and the number of operations is also very large.
**Input**:
```
10 10050
408293874 -3498597 7374783 295774930 -48574034 26623784 498754833 -294875830 283045804 85938045
```
**Output**:
```
897909241
```
**Explanation**: Inserting the sum of the entire array 10050 times results in a large positive sum, which modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is 897909241.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution handles both basic and edge cases effectively.
