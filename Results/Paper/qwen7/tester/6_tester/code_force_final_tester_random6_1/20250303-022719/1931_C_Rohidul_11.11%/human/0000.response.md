To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the simplest case where all elements are already the same.
**Input**:
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has only one element.
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has two different elements, and the operation can make them equal in one step.
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has multiple segments of the same element.
**Input**:
```
1
8
8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array is already homogeneous but has a mix of elements.
**Input**:
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
**Output**:
```
4
```

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the case where all elements are the same but the length of the array is very large.
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 1 1 ... 1 (200000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has a single segment of the same element.
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has a single segment of different elements.
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
4
```

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has a single segment of the same element followed by a segment of different elements.
**Input**:
```
1
7
1 1 1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
5
```

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has multiple segments of the same element.
**Input**:
```
1
9
1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
6
```

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has alternating segments of the same element.
**Input**:
```
1
9
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
8
```

#### Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has a mix of elements with a large gap between segments.
**Input**:
```
1
9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**:
```
8
```

#### Test 13
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has a mix of elements with a large gap between segments and some segments of the same element.
**Input**:
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 5 5 5 5 10
```
**Output**:
```
6
```

#### Test 14
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has a mix of elements with a large gap between segments and some segments of the same element, and the operation can be applied multiple times.
**Input**:
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
9
```

#### Test 15
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has a mix of elements with a large gap between segments and some segments of the same element, and the operation can be applied multiple times, ensuring the minimum cost.
**Input**:
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 5 5 5 5 10
```
**Output**:
```
6
```

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, from simple to complex, ensuring the solution handles various edge cases and typical use cases effectively.
