# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 7
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
Sasha can achieve this by placing 1 coin each time he wins and 2 coins each time he loses, ensuring he doesn't lose more than once in a row.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
Sasha starts with 1 coin and cannot place any bet since the minimum bet is 1 coin. Thus, he cannot win any more coins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3 15
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
Sasha can achieve this by strategically betting 1 coin after a win and 2 coins after a loss, ensuring he doesn't lose more than 3 times in a row.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 6
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
With a multiplier of 3, Sasha needs to win at least twice to double his coins. However, he can only afford to lose up to 3 times in a row, which limits his ability to accumulate coins significantly.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
With a multiplier of 4, Sasha needs to win at least twice to increase his coins. Losing 4 times in a row would leave him with no coins, making it impossible to achieve any number of coins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4 7
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
Sasha can achieve this by betting 1 coin after a win and 5 coins after a loss, ensuring he doesn't lose more than 4 times in a row.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4 88 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
With a large initial amount of coins and a high multiplier, Sasha can always find a strategy to win more coins without exceeding the limit of 88 consecutive losses.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
25 69 231
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
With a very high multiplier and a large limit of consecutive losses, Sasha's initial amount of coins is insufficient to cover the potential losses, making it impossible to guarantee winning any number of coins.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
13 97 18806
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
With a high multiplier and a large limit of consecutive losses, Sasha's initial amount of coins is still insufficient to cover the potential losses, making it impossible to guarantee winning any number of coins.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
2
2 1 1000000000
10 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the first case, Sasha can use a strategy similar to the one in Test 7 to ensure he can win any number of coins.
- For the second case, Sasha cannot place any bet initially, so he cannot win any more coins.
