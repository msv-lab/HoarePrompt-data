To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a simple 3x3 grid and k=1, d=2.

**Input**:
```
3 3 1 2
0 1 0
0 1 0
0 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The optimal solution is to place supports in the middle column of the second row, costing 1+1=2.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a larger grid and k=1, d=3.

**Input**:
```
4 5 1 3
0 1 2 3 0
0 2 1 2 0
0 3 2 1 0
0 1 2 3 0
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The optimal solution is to place supports in the middle column of the second row, costing 2+1+2=5.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works with multiple bridges (k=2).

**Input**:
```
4 5 2 2
0 1 2 3 0
0 2 1 2 0
0 3 2 1 0
0 1 2 3 0
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: The optimal solution is to place supports in the middle columns of the second and third rows, costing (2+1)+(2+1)=6.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a grid where k=n.

**Input**:
```
3 3 3 1
0 1 0
0 1 0
0 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Since k=n, we need to place supports in every row. The optimal solution is to place supports in the middle column of each row, costing 1+1+1=3.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a grid where d=1.

**Input**:
```
3 3 1 1
0 1 0
0 1 0
0 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Since d=1, supports must be placed next to each other. The optimal solution is to place supports in the middle column of the second row, costing 1+1+1=3.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a grid where d=m.

**Input**:
```
3 3 1 3
0 1 0
0 1 0
0 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Since d=m, supports can be placed at any position in the same row. The optimal solution is to place supports in the middle column of the second row, costing 1+1+1=3.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a grid with all zeros except for the middle column.

**Input**:
```
3 3 1 2
0 1 0
0 1 0
0 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The optimal solution is to place supports in the middle column of the second row, costing 1+1=2.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a grid with all zeros except for the middle row.

**Input**:
```
3 3 1 2
0 0 0
1 1 1
0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The optimal solution is to place supports in the middle column of the second row, costing 1+1+1=3.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a grid with all zeros except for the first and last rows.

**Input**:
```
3 3 1 2
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The optimal solution is to place supports on the river banks, costing 0.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a grid with all zeros except for the middle column of the middle row.

**Input**:
```
3 3 1 2
0 0 0
1 1 1
0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The optimal solution is to place supports in the middle column of the second row, costing 1+1+1=3.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
