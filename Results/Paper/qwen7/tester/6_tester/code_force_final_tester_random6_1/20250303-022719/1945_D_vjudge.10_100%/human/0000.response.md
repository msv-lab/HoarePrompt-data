# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```
**Explanation**: Kirill starts at position 4 and wants to move to one of the first 2 positions. The optimal strategy involves moving to position 3 and then to position 2, costing 3 + 11 = 14 coins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
6 9 7 1 8 3
5 8 8 1 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
22
```
**Explanation**: Kirill starts at position 6 and wants to move to one of the first 2 positions. The optimal strategy involves moving to position 5, then to position 4, then to position 3, and finally to position 2, costing 8 + 1 + 7 + 6 = 22 coins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
7 7
7 2 9 2 6 5 9
10 1 10 7 1 4 9
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: Kirill starts at position 7 and wants to move to position 7. No moves are needed, so the cost is 0. However, since he must be in the first 7 positions, the minimum cost is still 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
2 3
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Kirill starts at position 2 and wants to move to position 1. The optimal strategy involves moving to position 1, costing 1 coin.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1
1
1
3 3
1 2 3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
3
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the first test case, Kirill is already in the first position, so no moves are needed.
- For the second test case, Kirill starts at position 3 and wants to move to one of the first 3 positions. The optimal strategy involves moving to position 2 and then to position 1, costing 1 + 1 = 2 coins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2
10 5 2 8 3
3 7 1 5 2
```
**Output**: 
```
12
```
**Explanation**: Kirill starts at position 5 and wants to move to one of the first 2 positions. The optimal strategy involves moving to position 4, then to position 3, and finally to position 2, costing 5 + 1 + 6 = 12 coins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
8 4
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
30
```
**Explanation**: Kirill starts at position 8 and wants to move to one of the first 4 positions. The optimal strategy involves moving to position 7, then to position 6, then to position 5, and finally to position 4, costing 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 22 coins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
10 10 10
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Kirill starts at position 3 and wants to move to one of the first 3 positions. The optimal strategy involves moving to position 2, then to position 1, costing 1 + 1 = 2 coins. However, since he can move to any of the first 3 positions, the minimum cost is 1 coin if he moves directly to position 1.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4
4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: Kirill starts at position 4 and wants to move to position 1. The optimal strategy involves moving to position 3, then to position 2, and finally to position 1, costing 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 coins.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Kirill starts at position 5 and wants to move to position 5. No moves are needed, so the cost is 0.
