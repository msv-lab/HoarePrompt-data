# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: Vasya's position is 10 and the number he received is 2. According to the problem, the possible values of k are 2, 3, 5, and 6.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Vasya's position is 3 and the number he received is 1. The only possible value of k is 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
76 4
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
*Explanation*: Vasya's position is 76 and the number he received is 4. The possible values of k range from 4 to 13 (inclusive), giving us 10 - 1 = 9 possibilities.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
100 99
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Vasya's position is 100 and the number he received is 99. Since the maximum value of k is 98 (as k must be less than n), there are no valid k values that satisfy the condition.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 500000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Vasya's position is 1,000,000,000 and the number he received is 500,000,000. The only possible value of k is 1,000,000,000 because the settling pattern repeats every 2k-2 positions, and the number 500,000,000 can only be achieved when k = 1,000,000,000.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2
10 1
10 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2
```
*Explanation*: For the first case, Vasya's position is 10 and the number he received is 1. The only possible value of k is 2. For the second case, Vasya's position is 10 and the number he received is 3. The possible values of k are 3 and 5.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Vasya's position is 2 and the number he received is 1. The only possible value of k is 2.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Vasya's position is 2 and the number he received is 2. There are no valid values of k since the settling pattern would require k to be greater than 1, but the number 2 cannot be assigned to the second position in any valid k.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Vasya's position is 3 and the number he received is 3. The only possible value of k is 3.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Vasya's position is 4 and the number he received is 2. The possible values of k are 2 and 4.

These test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the solution is robust and reliable.
