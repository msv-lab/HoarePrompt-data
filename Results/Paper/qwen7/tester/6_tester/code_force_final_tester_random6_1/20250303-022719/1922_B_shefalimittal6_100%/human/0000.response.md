# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
**Explanation**: There are 7 sticks, and any combination of 3 sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle since all sticks have the same length. The number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 7 is given by the combination formula \( C(7, 3) = \frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = 35 \).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: There are 4 sticks with lengths \(2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^3\). The valid combinations to form a non-degenerate triangle are (3, 2, 1) and (3, 3, 1), but since the order does not matter, we only count (1, 2, 3) and (1, 3, 3) once, which gives us 2 valid combinations.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are 3 sticks with lengths \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3\). No combination of these sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle because the sum of the lengths of any two sticks is not greater than the length of the third stick.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one stick, so it is impossible to form a triangle with exactly 3 sticks.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
20
0
```
**Explanation**: For the first test case, there are 6 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5\). The valid combinations are those where the sum of the two smaller lengths is greater than the largest length. This results in 20 valid combinations. For the second test case, the sticks have lengths \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3\), and no combination can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: There are 5 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^0, 2^1, 2^1, 2^1\). The valid combinations are (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1), and (1, 1, 1), resulting in 6 valid combinations.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All sticks have the same length \(2^0\), and no combination of 3 sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: There are 4 sticks with lengths \(2^1, 2^1, 2^1, 2^2\). The valid combinations are (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (1, 1, 2), and (1, 2, 2), resulting in 4 valid combinations.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are 2 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^1\). No combination of 3 sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
8
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**: 
```
56
```
**Explanation**: There are 8 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7\). The valid combinations are those where the sum of the two smaller lengths is greater than the largest length. This results in 56 valid combinations.
