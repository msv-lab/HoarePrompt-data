**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The subsegments of length 4 starting from positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are [4, 1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4, 5], and [3, 4, 5, 6] respectively. Each of these subsegments has at least one element that matches the elements in array b, so the output is 4.

# Test 48
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when k is 1 and there are some matches at the beginning of the array.
**Input**: 
```
1
7 4 1
4 1 2 3 4 5 6
4 1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The subsegments of length 4 starting from positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are [4, 1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4, 5], and [3, 4, 5, 6] respectively. Each of these subsegments has at least one element that matches the elements in array b, so the output is 4.

# Test 49
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when k is 1 and there are some matches at the end of the array.
**Input**: 
```
1
7 4 1
4 1 2 3 4 5 6
5 6 7 8
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The subsegments of length 4 starting from positions 4 and 5 are [3, 4, 5, 6] and [4, 5, 6, 1] respectively. Only the subsegments starting from positions 4 and 5 have at least one element that matches the elements in array b, so the output is 2.

# Test 50
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when k is 1 and there are no matches in the entire array.
**Input**: 
```
1
7 4 1
4 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: None of the subsegments of length 4 have any elements that match the elements in array b, so the output is 0.

# Test 51
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when k is 1 and there are some matches in the middle of the array.
**Input**: 
```
1
7 4 1
4 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 3 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The subsegments of length 4 starting from positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are [4, 1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4, 5], and [3, 4, 5, 6] respectively. Each of these subsegments has at least one element that matches the elements in array b, so the output is 4.
