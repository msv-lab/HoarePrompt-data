# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
**Output**: 
```
27 41 12 
```
*Explanation*: This is the provided example where we need to distribute the coins such that the total bet is less than the winnings for each outcome.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 
```
*Explanation*: This is another provided example where the smallest possible bet is used for both outcomes.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: Here, the multipliers are the same for all outcomes, making it impossible to find a distribution of bets that satisfies the condition.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
```
**Output**: 
```
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
```
*Explanation*: This is another provided example where the bets are calculated to ensure the total bet is less than the winnings for each outcome.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
6 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: Here, the multipliers are such that no matter how the bets are distributed, the total bet cannot be made smaller than the winnings for each outcome.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
9 4 6 8 3
```
**Output**: 
```
8 18 12 9 24 
```
*Explanation*: This is another provided example where the bets are calculated to ensure the total bet is less than the winnings for each outcome.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
1
2
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 
3 
```
*Explanation*: For a single outcome, the entire bet is placed on that outcome. For three outcomes, the smallest possible bets are used.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
50
20 20 20 ... 20 (50 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: When all outcomes have the same multiplier, it is impossible to satisfy the condition.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
1 
```
*Explanation*: With only one outcome, the entire bet is placed on that outcome.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1
100
```
**Output**: 
```
1 
```
*Explanation*: Similar to the previous case, but with a higher multiplier.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 
```
*Explanation*: With only one outcome and a multiplier of 2, the entire bet is placed on that outcome.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 
```
*Explanation*: With two outcomes and the same multiplier, the smallest possible bets are used.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
3
3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 
```
*Explanation*: With three outcomes and different multipliers, the smallest possible bets are used.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
3
11 12 13
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 
```
*Explanation*: With three outcomes and different multipliers, the smallest possible bets are used.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
3
11 12 13
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 
```
*Explanation*: This is a duplicate of the previous test case, ensuring consistency in results.
