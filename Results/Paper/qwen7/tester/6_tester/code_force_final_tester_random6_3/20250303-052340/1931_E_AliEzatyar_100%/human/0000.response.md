# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: 
- Anna can only reverse the integer 2, making it 2. Then, Sasha can concatenate 2 and 14 to form 214, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Anna has no other possible moves, so Sasha wins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: 
- Anna can reverse 9 to get 9, 56 to get 65, and 1 to get 1. No matter what Sasha concatenates, the resulting number will be less than \(10^5\), so Anna wins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 10
1 2007 800 1580
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: 
- Anna can reverse 1 to get 1, 2007 to get 7002, 800 to get 800, and 1580 to get 8510. Sasha can concatenate 2007 and 1580 to form 20071580, which is greater than \(10^{10}\). Anna has no other possible moves, so Sasha wins.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
5000 123 30 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: 
- Anna can reverse 5000 to get 5000, 123 to get 321, 30 to get 30, and 4 to get 4. No matter what Sasha concatenates, the resulting number will be less than \(10^5\), so Anna wins.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
6 4 6 2 3 1 10 9 10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: 
- Anna can reverse each number. Sasha can concatenate numbers to form a number greater than \(10^{10}\). Anna has no other possible moves, so Sasha wins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: 
- There is only one number, and Anna cannot make a move. Sasha wins immediately.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10
10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: 
- Anna can reverse 10 to get 10. Sasha can concatenate 10 with itself to form 1010, which is greater than \(10^{10}\). Anna has no other possible moves, so Sasha wins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
8 5
1 2 9 10 10 2 10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: 
- Anna can reverse each number. Sasha can concatenate numbers to form a number less than \(10^5\). Anna wins.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: 
- Anna can reverse each number. Sasha can concatenate 10 and 10 to form 1010, which is greater than \(10^5\). Anna has no other possible moves, so Sasha wins.
