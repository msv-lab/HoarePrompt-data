# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: This is the example given in the problem statement. Nene will play optimally to minimize your score while maximizing hers. By selecting the cards as described, you can achieve a maximum score of 1.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
8
7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: In this case, Nene will play optimally to minimize your score. By selecting the cards as described, you can achieve a maximum score of 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
8
7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Here, Nene will play optimally to minimize your score. By selecting the cards as described, you can achieve a maximum score of 1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Since you have all unique numbers, Nene can play optimally to prevent you from scoring any points. Therefore, you cannot score any points.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: With only one card, Nene can play optimally to prevent you from scoring any points.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2
1
1
2
2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
1
```
*Explanation*: In the first subcase, you have one card, and Nene can play optimally to prevent you from scoring any points. In the second subcase, you have two cards, and Nene can play optimally to allow you to score 1 point.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
2
1 1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
1
```
*Explanation*: In the first subcase, you have two identical cards, and Nene can play optimally to prevent you from scoring any points. In the second subcase, you have two different cards, and Nene can play optimally to allow you to score 1 point.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
3
1 1 2
2 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
1
```
*Explanation*: In the first subcase, you have two pairs of identical cards, and Nene can play optimally to prevent you from scoring any points. In the second subcase, you have two pairs of different cards, and Nene can play optimally to allow you to score 1 point.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
4
1 1 2 3
2 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
0
1
```
*Explanation*: In the first subcase, you have two pairs of cards, and Nene can play optimally to prevent you from scoring any points. In the second subcase, you have two pairs of different cards, and Nene can play optimally to allow you to score 1 point.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
2
5
1 1 2 3 4
2 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
1
```
*Explanation*: In the first subcase, you have two pairs of cards, and Nene can play optimally to prevent you from scoring any points. In the second subcase, you have two pairs of different cards, and Nene can play optimally to allow you to score 1 point.

These test cases cover a range of scenarios from basic to edge cases, ensuring the solution handles various distributions of cards and optimal play strategies.
