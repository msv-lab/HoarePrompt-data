```
*Explanation*: Alice can put books 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the first pile, and books 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 in the second pile. She will read the book with the highest number 5 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 10 from the second pile, totaling 5 + 10 = 15 pages. However, the optimal solution is to put books 1, 2, 3, 4, and 10 in the first pile, and books 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 in the second pile, totaling 10 + 9 = 19 pages. Further optimization shows that the best split is to put books 1, 2, 3, 9, and 10 in the first pile, and books 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 in the second pile, totaling 10 + 9 = 19 pages.

However, the optimal solution is to put the first book in the second pile and the other two books in the first pile, totaling 1 + 1000000000 = 1000000001 pages. The correct answer is 1000000002: 1000000000 + 2 = 1000000002.
