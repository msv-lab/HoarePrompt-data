To address the given problem, we need to implement a function that determines the winner of the game based on the initial configuration of stone piles. Below are the comprehensive test cases, including basic and edge scenarios, to ensure the solution's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can win by choosing \( k = 3 \) on her first turn, which will empty all piles.

#### Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 7
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice must choose \( k = 1 \) on her first turn, leaving Bob to choose \( k = 6 \) on his turn, thus winning the game.

#### Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
7
1 3 9 7 4 2 100
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \( k = 1 \) on her first turn, reducing the piles to \( [0, 2, 8, 6, 3, 1, 99] \), and then Bob will be forced into a losing position.

#### Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \( k = 1 \) on her first turn, reducing the piles to \( [0, 1, 2] \), and then Bob will be forced into a losing position.

#### Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
6
2 1 3 4 2 4
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \( k = 1 \) on her first turn, reducing the piles to \( [1, 0, 2, 3, 1, 3] \), and then Bob will be forced into a losing position.

#### Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
8
5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice must choose \( k = 2 \) on her first turn, leaving Bob to choose \( k = 3 \) on his turn, thus winning the game.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \( k = 1000000000 \) on her first turn, emptying the pile and winning the game.

#### Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \( k = 1 \) on her first turn, emptying the pile and winning the game.

#### Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \( k = 1 \) on her first turn, emptying both piles and winning the game.

#### Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \( k = 1 \) on her first turn, emptying all piles and winning the game.

#### Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \( k = 1 \) on her first turn, reducing all piles to zero and winning the game.

#### Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
2
1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \( k = 1 \) on her first turn, reducing the piles to \( [999999999, 0] \), and then Bob will be forced into a losing position.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring that the solution handles both typical and edge cases effectively.
