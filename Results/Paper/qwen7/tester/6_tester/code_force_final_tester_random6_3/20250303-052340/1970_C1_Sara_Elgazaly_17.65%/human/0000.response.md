# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the tree has exactly two leaves and the stone is placed on one of them.
**Input**: 
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path with nodes 1, 2, and 3. Node 3 is a leaf. Ron places the stone on node 3. Since node 2 is the only neighbor of node 3 and it is inactive, Ron moves the stone to node 2. Hermione then has no valid move and loses. Therefore, Ron wins.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the tree has exactly two leaves and the stone is placed on the other leaf.
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path with nodes 1, 2, and 3. Node 1 is a leaf. Ron places the stone on node 1. Since node 2 is the only neighbor of node 1 and it is inactive, Ron moves the stone to node 2. Hermione then has no valid move and loses. Therefore, Ron wins. However, since the stone is on node 2 now, Hermione will win the next turn as she can move the stone back to node 1 and Ron will have no valid move left.
