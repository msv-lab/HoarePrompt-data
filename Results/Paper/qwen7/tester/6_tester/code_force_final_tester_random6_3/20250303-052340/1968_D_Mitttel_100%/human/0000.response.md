To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with simple inputs.
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```
**Output**:
```
Bodya
```
**Explanation**: Bodya starts at position 3 and Sasha starts at position 2. After two turns, Bodya ends up with a higher score than Sasha.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with different starting positions.
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 1 3
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Bodya starts at position 1 and Sasha starts at position 3. After two turns, Sasha ends up with a higher score than Bodya.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with equal scores.
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 2 3
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Bodya starts at position 2 and Sasha starts at position 3. After two turns, both end up with the same score.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the permutation and array lengths are minimal.
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 1 2
2 1 2
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
Bodya
```
**Explanation**: Both players start at their respective positions and move to the other position in one turn. Bodya ends up with a higher score.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the game duration is minimal.
**Input**:
```
1
4 1 1 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```
**Output**:
```
Bodya
```
**Explanation**: Both players start at their respective positions and do not move. Bodya ends up with a higher score.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the game duration is maximal.
**Input**:
```
1
4 1000000000 1 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```
**Output**:
```
Bodya
```
**Explanation**: Both players start at their respective positions and move optimally over a large number of turns. Bodya ends up with a higher score.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the permutation and array are identical.
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 1 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Both players start at their respective positions and move optimally. They end up with the same score.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the permutation and array are reversed.
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 4 3
4 3 2 1
6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Both players start at their respective positions and move optimally. Sasha ends up with a higher score.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the permutation and array are completely different.
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 1 3
4 3 2 1
6 5 4 3
```
**Output**:
```
Bodya
```
**Explanation**: Both players start at their respective positions and move optimally. Bodya ends up with a higher score.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the permutation and array are partially similar.
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 1 2
4 2 1 3
6 5 4 3
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Both players start at their respective positions and move optimally. They end up with the same score.
