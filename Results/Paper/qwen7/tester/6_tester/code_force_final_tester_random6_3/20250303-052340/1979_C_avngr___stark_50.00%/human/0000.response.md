# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
**Output**: 
```
27 41 12 
```
*Explanation*: This is the provided example where the solution is already given.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 
```
*Explanation*: Another provided example where the solution is given.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: Here, all multipliers are the same, making it impossible to find a distribution that satisfies the condition.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
```
**Output**: 
```
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
```
*Explanation*: This is another provided example where the solution is given.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
6 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: Here, the multipliers are too small compared to the required sum, making it impossible to find a valid distribution.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
9 4 6 8 3
```
**Output**: 
```
8 18 12 9 24 
```
*Explanation*: This is another provided example where the solution is given.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
1
10
2
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
1 1 
```
*Explanation*: In the first subcase, only one outcome exists, and it is impossible to distribute coins as required. In the second subcase, the multipliers are the same, but since there are only two outcomes, betting one coin on each is sufficient.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: All multipliers are the same, making it impossible to find a valid distribution.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4
11 12 13 14
```
**Output**: 
```
1001 1008 1013 1014 
```
*Explanation*: This is a case where the multipliers are different and large enough to satisfy the condition.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 
```
*Explanation*: Only one outcome exists, and betting one coin is sufficient.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1
20
```
**Output**: 
```
1 
```
*Explanation*: Only one outcome exists, and betting one coin is sufficient.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: All multipliers are the same, making it impossible to find a valid distribution.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
```
**Output**: 
```
1001 1008 1013 1014 1015 1016 1017 1018 1019 1020 
```
*Explanation*: Multipliers are different and large enough to satisfy the condition.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
```
**Output**: 
```
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 
```
*Explanation*: Multipliers are consecutive integers, and the smallest multiplier is 2, which allows a simple linear distribution.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10
20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: All multipliers are the same, making it impossible to find a valid distribution.

These test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the solution.
