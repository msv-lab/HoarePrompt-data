# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 3 1 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The phone starts with 3 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 3 would consume 3 units of charge, depleting the battery completely. Turning off and on the phone consumes 5 units of energy, which is more than the available charge. Hence, it is not possible to send the message.
