To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to consider both basic and edge scenarios. Hereâ€™s how we can structure the test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the input rectangle is a square.
**Input**:
```
2
1 1
2 2
```
**Output**:
```
No
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 1x1 rectangle cannot be divided further, so the answer is "No". A 2x2 rectangle can be divided into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 2x2 rectangle, but since we are considering unique rectangles up to rotation, the answer is "Yes".

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the input rectangle is a simple non-square.
**Input**:
```
2
2 1
3 2
```
**Output**:
```
No
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 2x1 rectangle cannot be divided further, so the answer is "No". A 3x2 rectangle can be divided into two 3x1 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, so the answer is "Yes".

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the input rectangle is a larger non-square.
**Input**:
```
2
2 6
3 4
```
**Output**:
```
Yes
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 2x6 rectangle can be divided into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle. A 3x4 rectangle can be divided into two 3x2 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 6x2 rectangle, so the answer is "Yes".

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the smallest possible input.
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
No
```
**Explanation**: A 1x1 rectangle cannot be divided further, so the answer is "No".

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the largest possible input within the constraints.
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 1000000000x1000000000 rectangle can be divided into two 1000000000x500000000 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 500000000x1000000000 rectangle, so the answer is "Yes".

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a degenerate case where one side is 1.
**Input**:
```
1
1 10
```
**Output**:
```
No
```
**Explanation**: A 1x10 rectangle cannot be divided further, so the answer is "No".

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a case where the rectangle can be divided into smaller identical rectangles.
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**:
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 2x2 rectangle can be divided into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 2x2 rectangle, so the answer is "Yes".

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a case where the rectangle can be divided into smaller rectangles that can form a new rectangle.
**Input**:
```
1
3 2
```
**Output**:
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 3x2 rectangle can be divided into two 3x1 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, so the answer is "Yes".

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a case where the rectangle cannot be divided further.
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
No
```
**Explanation**: A 2x1 rectangle cannot be divided further, so the answer is "No".
