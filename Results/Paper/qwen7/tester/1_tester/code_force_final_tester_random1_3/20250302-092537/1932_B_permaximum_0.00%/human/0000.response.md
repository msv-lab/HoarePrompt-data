# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Comment**: This tests a scenario where one periodicity is a multiple of another. The expected result is the larger periodicity, ensuring the function handles such cases correctly.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Comment**: This tests a scenario where the periodicities form a sequence that is not strictly increasing but still requires calculating the LCM. Ensures the function can handle non-sequential but related periodicities.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 3 5 7
```
**Output**: 
```
105
```
**Comment**: This tests a scenario where the periodicities are prime numbers. The expected result is the product of these primes, ensuring the function can handle prime periodicities.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4
10 20 30 40
```
**Output**: 
```
120
```
**Comment**: This tests a scenario where the periodicities are multiples of a smaller number. The expected result is the largest periodicity multiplied by the number of elements, ensuring the function can handle such cases.

**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000 500 250
```
**Output**: 
```
1000
```
**Comment**: This tests a scenario where the periodicities share common factors. The expected result is the largest periodicity, ensuring the function can handle cases with shared factors.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000 1000 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000
```
**Comment**: This tests a scenario where all periodicities are identical. The expected result is the same periodicity, ensuring the function can handle identical values.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
**Comment**: This tests the maximum possible input for a single periodicity. Ensures the function can handle the upper limit of the input range.

# Test 13
