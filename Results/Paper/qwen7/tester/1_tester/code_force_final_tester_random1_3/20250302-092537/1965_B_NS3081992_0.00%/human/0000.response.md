```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 500001
```
**Explanation**: For n = 1000000 and k = 500000, the subsequence [1, 500001] ensures that there is no subsequence summing to 500000, but all other sums from 1 to 1000000 are possible.

```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: For n = 1000000 and k = 1000000, the only subsequence that can sum to 1000000 is the entire sequence itself, which is not allowed. Thus, a sequence of size 1 with a single element 1 is sufficient.
