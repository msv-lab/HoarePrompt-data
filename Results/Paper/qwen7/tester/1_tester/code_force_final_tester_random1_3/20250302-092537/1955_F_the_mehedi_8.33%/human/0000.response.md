To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here's how we can structure these test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1: Simple Case with Equal Distribution
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with a balanced distribution of numbers.

**Input**:
```
1 1 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There is one '1', one '2', and one '3'. If Eve removes one '1', the remaining sequence will have a non-zero XOR, allowing Alice to win. If Eve removes '2' or '3', the remaining sequence will still have a non-zero XOR. Therefore, Bob can only win once if Eve removes optimally.

#### Test 2: Simple Case with Fewer Numbers
**Input**:
```
1 0 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There is one '1', one '3', and two '4's. If Eve removes one '1' or '3', the remaining sequence will have a non-zero XOR, allowing Alice to win. If Eve removes one '4', the remaining sequence will still have a non-zero XOR. Therefore, Bob can only win once if Eve removes optimally.

#### Test 3: Simple Case with More Numbers
**Input**:
```
2 2 2 0
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: There are two '1's, two '2's, and two '3's. Eve can remove one '1', one '2', and one '3' to make the XOR zero, allowing Bob to win. Therefore, Bob can win up to three times.

#### Test 4: Simple Case with All Ones
**Input**:
```
3 3 2 0
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: There are three '1's, three '2's, and two '3's. Eve can remove one '1', one '2', and one '3' to make the XOR zero, allowing Bob to win. Therefore, Bob can win up to three times.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 5: All Zeros
**Input**:
```
0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are no numbers in the sequence, so Alice cannot win. Bob wins by default.

#### Test 6: Single Number
**Input**:
```
1 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one '1', and removing it leaves no numbers, so Bob wins by default.

#### Test 7: Maximum Possible Numbers
**Input**:
```
200 200 200 200
```
**Output**:
```
200
```
**Explanation**: There are 200 of each type of number. Eve can remove 200 numbers to make the XOR zero, allowing Bob to win 200 times.

#### Test 8: All Fours
**Input**:
```
0 0 0 200
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are 200 '4's. Removing any number does not change the XOR, which remains zero. Therefore, Bob wins by default.

#### Test 9: Large Input with Balanced Distribution
**Input**:
```
100 100 100 100
```
**Output**:
```
100
```
**Explanation**: There are 100 of each type of number. Eve can remove 100 numbers to make the XOR zero, allowing Bob to win 100 times.
