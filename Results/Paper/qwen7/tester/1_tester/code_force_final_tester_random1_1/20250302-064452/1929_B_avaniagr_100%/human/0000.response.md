# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- The input is a single test case with a grid size of 3x3 and a requirement of 4 diagonals having at least one colored cell.
- The minimum number of cells needed to be colored to satisfy the condition is 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- The input is a single test case with a grid size of 3x3 and a requirement of 3 diagonals having at least one colored cell.
- The minimum number of cells needed to be colored to satisfy the condition is 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 10
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: 
- The input is a single test case with a grid size of 3x3 and a requirement of 10 diagonals having at least one colored cell.
- Since there are only 8 diagonals in a 3x3 grid, we need to color all 6 cells to meet the requirement.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: 
- The input is a single test case with a grid size of 3x3 and a requirement of 9 diagonals having at least one colored cell.
- We need to color 5 cells to meet the requirement since coloring 6 cells would exceed the requirement.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: 
- The input is a single test case with a grid size of 4x4 and a requirement of 7 diagonals having at least one colored cell.
- By coloring the cells in a strategic manner, we can achieve the requirement with 4 cells.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7 11
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: 
- The input is a single test case with a grid size of 7x7 and a requirement of 11 diagonals having at least one colored cell.
- By coloring the cells in a strategic manner, we can achieve the requirement with 6 cells.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- The input is a single test case with a grid size of 2x2 and a requirement of 3 diagonals having at least one colored cell.
- By coloring the cells in a strategic manner, we can achieve the requirement with 2 cells.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
3 4
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- Two separate test cases with the same inputs as Test 1 and Test 2 respectively.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
3 10
3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
6
5
```
**Explanation**: 
- Two separate test cases with the same inputs as Test 3 and Test 4 respectively.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
2
4 7
7 11
```
**Output**: 
```
4
6
```
**Explanation**: 
- Two separate test cases with the same inputs as Test 5 and Test 6 respectively.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
2
2 3
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- Two separate test cases with the same inputs as Test 7 and a smaller requirement as in Test 2 respectively.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 400000000
```
**Output**: 
```
400000000
```
**Explanation**: 
- A large test case where the requirement is close to the maximum number of diagonals (4n - 2).

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 400000001
```
**Output**: 
```
100000000
```
**Explanation**: 
- A large test case where the requirement exceeds the maximum number of diagonals (4n - 2). In this case, all cells must be colored.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: 
- A large test case where the requirement is the minimum (1 diagonal). Coloring just one cell will suffice.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- A small test case where the requirement is exactly 2 diagonals. Coloring 2 cells will suffice.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: 
- A small test case where the requirement is the minimum (1 diagonal). Coloring 1 cell will suffice.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- A small test case where the requirement is more than the number of diagonals (4). Coloring 2 cells will suffice.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- A small test case where the requirement is 3 diagonals. Coloring 2 cells will suffice.
