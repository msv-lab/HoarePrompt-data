# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
This is a basic test case where \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \). The goal is to color the minimum number of cells such that 4 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The solution provided colors 2 cells to achieve this.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
Here, \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \). Coloring 2 cells ensures that 3 diagonals have at least one colored cell. This is another basic test case.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 10
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: 
For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \), we need to color all 6 cells since there are only 10 diagonals in total and all must have at least one colored cell.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: 
For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 9 \), we need to color 5 out of the 6 cells to ensure that 9 out of the 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: 
For \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 7 \), we can color 4 cells to ensure that 7 diagonals have at least one colored cell. This is a more complex case than previous ones.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7 11
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: 
For \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 11 \), we need to color 6 cells to ensure that 11 out of the 26 diagonals have at least one colored cell.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \), we need to color 2 cells to ensure that 3 out of the 6 diagonals have at least one colored cell.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
2 3
3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
```
**Explanation**: 
This test checks if the function handles multiple test cases correctly. Both sub-cases are identical to Test 7 and Test 1 respectively.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 400000000
```
**Output**: 
```
400000000
```
**Explanation**: 
For very large \( n \) and \( k \), the minimum number of cells to color is \( k \) because there are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals, and we need to color at least \( k \) of them. Here, \( k \) is exactly half of the total number of diagonals, ensuring all diagonals are covered.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 400000001
```
**Output**: 
```
400000002
```
**Explanation**: 
Here, \( k \) is slightly more than half of the total number of diagonals. We need to color \( k \) cells to cover all diagonals, plus one additional cell to meet the requirement.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
For \( n = 100000000 \) and \( k = 1 \), we need to color just 2 cells to ensure at least one diagonal has a colored cell. This is the minimum required to satisfy the condition.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 400000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
400000000000000000
```
**Explanation**: 
Here, \( k \) is extremely large, but still less than the total number of diagonals. The function should return \( k \) as the answer.

These test cases cover a range of scenarios from small inputs to very large ones, including edge cases where \( k \) is close to or exceeds the total number of diagonals.
