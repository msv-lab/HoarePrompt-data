# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: There are no valid pairs (a, b) where \(1 \le a \le 1\) and \(1 \le b \le 1\) such that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The only valid pair is (2, 3) because \(3 \cdot \gcd(2, 3) = 3 \cdot 1 = 3\) which is a multiple of \(2 + 3 = 5\). However, 3 is not a multiple of 5, so there are no valid pairs. The correct pair is (2, 2) since \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4\) which is a multiple of \(2 + 2 = 4\).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The only valid pair is (3, 3) because \(3 \cdot \gcd(3, 3) = 3 \cdot 3 = 9\) which is a multiple of \(3 + 3 = 6\). However, 9 is not a multiple of 6, so there are no valid pairs. The correct pair is (3, 3) since \(3 \cdot \gcd(3, 3) = 3 \cdot 3 = 9\) which is a multiple of \(3 + 3 = 6\).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
10 8
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
*Explanation*: The valid pairs are (2, 2), (3, 6), (4, 4), (6, 3), (6, 6), and (8, 8) because:
- For (2, 2): \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4\) which is a multiple of \(2 + 2 = 4\).
- For (3, 6): \(6 \cdot \gcd(3, 6) = 6 \cdot 3 = 18\) which is a multiple of \(3 + 6 = 9\).
- For (4, 4): \(4 \cdot \gcd(4, 4) = 4 \cdot 4 = 16\) which is a multiple of \(4 + 4 = 8\).
- For (6, 3): \(3 \cdot \gcd(6, 3) = 3 \cdot 3 = 9\) which is a multiple of \(6 + 3 = 9\).
- For (6, 6): \(6 \cdot \gcd(6, 6) = 6 \cdot 6 = 36\) which is a multiple of \(6 + 6 = 12\).
- For (8, 8): \(8 \cdot \gcd(8, 8) = 8 \cdot 8 = 64\) which is a multiple of \(8 + 8 = 16\).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
100 1233
```
**Output**: 
```
423
```
*Explanation*: This requires calculating the number of valid pairs (a, b) for larger values of n and m. The exact calculation involves iterating through possible values and checking the condition.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1145141
```
**Output**: 
```
5933961
```
*Explanation*: This tests the function's performance and correctness with very large inputs. The exact calculation involves iterating through possible values and checking the condition.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
1 2000000
2000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
```
*Explanation*: For \(n = 1\) and any \(m\), the only possible pair (1, 1) does not satisfy the condition. For \(m = 1\) and any \(n\), the only possible pair (1, 1) does not satisfy the condition.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1000000
1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
```
*Explanation*: Similar to Test 7, but with a different range. No valid pairs exist in these cases.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1000000
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
*Explanation*: For \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1000000\), the only possible pair (1, 1) does not satisfy the condition. For \(n = 1000000\) and \(m = 1000000\), the only possible pair (1000000, 1000000) satisfies the condition.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
2
1000000 1000000
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
1000000
```
*Explanation*: Both inputs are the same, and the only valid pair is (1000000, 1000000).

These test cases cover basic and edge scenarios to ensure the solution's robustness and reliability.
