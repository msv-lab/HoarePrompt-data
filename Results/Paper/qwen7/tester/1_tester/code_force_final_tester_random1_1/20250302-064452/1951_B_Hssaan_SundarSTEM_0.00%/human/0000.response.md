To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the cow's initial position allows it to win as many matches as possible without any swaps.

**Input**:
```
3
6 1
12 10 14 11 8 3
6 5
7 2 727 10 12 13
2 2
1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
2
0
```

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the cow's initial position is near the end, but a swap can improve its performance.

**Input**:
```
3
6 6
3 8 12 10 14 11
6 1
7 2 727 10 12 13
2 1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
2
0
```

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the cow's initial position is in the middle, and swapping can significantly improve its performance.

**Input**:
```
3
6 3
10 12 8 11 14 3
6 1
7 2 727 10 12 13
2 1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
2
0
```

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the cow's initial position is at the very beginning, and no swap can improve its performance.

**Input**:
```
3
6 1
7 2 727 10 12 13
6 6
3 8 12 10 14 11
2 1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
1
0
```

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the cow's initial position is at the very end, and no swap can improve its performance.

**Input**:
```
3
6 6
7 2 727 10 12 13
6 1
3 8 12 10 14 11
2 2
1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
1
0
```

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the cow's initial position is in the middle, and swapping with a cow with a higher rating can improve its performance.

**Input**:
```
3
6 3
7 2 10 12 14 11
6 1
3 8 12 10 14 11
2 1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
2
0
```

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the cow's initial position is in the middle, and swapping with a cow with a lower rating cannot improve its performance.

**Input**:
```
3
6 3
10 12 14 11 8 3
6 1
7 2 727 10 12 13
2 1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
2
0
```

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the cow's initial position is in the middle, and swapping with a cow with a similar rating can improve its performance.

**Input**:
```
3
6 3
10 12 14 11 8 3
6 1
7 2 727 10 12 13
2 1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
2
0
```

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the cow's initial position is in the middle, and swapping with a cow with a much lower rating can improve its performance.

**Input**:
```
3
6 3
10 12 14 11 8 3
6 1
7 2 727 10 12 13
2 1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
2
0
```

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the cow's initial position is in the middle, and swapping with a cow with a much higher rating can improve its performance.

**Input**:
```
3
6 3
10 12 14 11 8 3
6 1
7 2 727 10 12 13
2 1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
2
0
```

These test cases cover various scenarios to ensure the solution is robust and reliable.
