# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with a simple, balanced subarray where the sum of elements is even and can be split into two equal parts.

**Input**:
```
1
6 2
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 6
3 6
```
**Output**:
```
YES
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the full array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], we can find a valid b such that the sum of a and b are equal and no element is the same. One possible b is [2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5].
- For the subarray [3, 4, 5, 6], it is impossible to find a valid b because the sum is 18, which cannot be evenly split into two different arrays of positive integers without repeating elements.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Check the function with a subarray that has only one element, which is impossible to satisfy the condition since there is no other element to form a different array.

**Input**:
```
1
1 1
5
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- The subarray [5] cannot be transformed into another array b of the same length with all elements being positive and distinct from the original array.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Test the function with a subarray that has a very large sum but still can be split into two equal parts.

**Input**:
```
1
10 2
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 10
1 5
```
**Output**:
```
YES
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the full array [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], we can find a valid b such that the sum of a and b are equal and no element is the same. One possible b is [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
- For the subarray [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], we can find a valid b such that the sum of a and b are equal and no element is the same. One possible b is [2, 1, 1, 1, 1].

# Test 4
**Objective**: Test the function with a subarray that has a very small sum and cannot be split into two equal parts.

**Input**:
```
1
3 1
1 1 1
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- The subarray [1, 1, 1] cannot be transformed into another array b of the same length with all elements being positive and distinct from the original array.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Test the function with a subarray that has a sum that is odd and cannot be split into two equal parts.

**Input**:
```
1
3 1
1 2 3
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- The subarray [1, 2, 3] has a sum of 6, which is even, but it cannot be split into two equal parts with distinct elements. Therefore, it is impossible to find a valid b.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Test the function with a subarray that has a sum that is even but cannot be split into two equal parts due to the nature of the elements.

**Input**:
```
1
4 1
2 2 2 2
1 4
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- The subarray [2, 2, 2, 2] has a sum of 8, which is even, but it cannot be split into two equal parts with distinct elements. Therefore, it is impossible to find a valid b.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Test the function with a subarray that has a sum that is even and can be split into two equal parts but has repeated elements.

**Input**:
```
1
4 1
1 2 1 2
1 4
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- The subarray [1, 2, 1, 2] has a sum of 6, which is even, but it cannot be split into two equal parts with distinct elements. Therefore, it is impossible to find a valid b.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Test the function with a subarray that has a sum that is even and can be split into two equal parts but has repeated elements in a way that makes it impossible to form a valid b.

**Input**:
```
1
4 1
1 1 1 1
1 4
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- The subarray [1, 1, 1, 1] has a sum of 4, which is even, but it cannot be split into two equal parts with distinct elements. Therefore, it is impossible to find a valid b.
