# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: In this basic test case, there is one '1', one '2', and one '3' in the sequence. Since the bitwise XOR of all numbers is non-zero (1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 001 ^ 010 ^ 011 = 000), Alice wins initially. Eve can remove any one of these numbers to make the XOR zero, ensuring Bob wins. Therefore, Bob can win once.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Here, there is one '1', one '3', and two '4's. The initial XOR of the sequence is 1 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 4 = 1 ^ 3 ^ 0 ^ 0 = 001 ^ 011 = 010. Eve can remove one '1' or one '3' to make the XOR zero, ensuring Bob wins. Therefore, Bob can win once.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: With two '1's, two '2's, and two '3's, the initial XOR is 1 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 3 = 0. Eve can strategically remove pairs of identical numbers to keep the XOR zero, allowing Bob to win every time. Therefore, Bob can win three times.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: With three '1's, three '2's, and two '3's, the initial XOR is 1 ^ 1 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 3 = 0. Similar to the previous case, Eve can remove pairs of identical numbers to maintain a zero XOR, allowing Bob to win every time. Therefore, Bob can win three times.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
0 9 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
12
```
**Explanation**: With nine '2's, nine '3's, and no '1's or '4's, the initial XOR is 2 ^ 2 ^ ... ^ 2 (9 times) ^ 3 ^ 3 ^ ... ^ 3 (9 times) = 0. Eve can remove pairs of identical numbers to keep the XOR zero, allowing Bob to win every time. Therefore, Bob can win twelve times.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With one '1', one '2', one '3', and one '4', the initial XOR is 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 = 001 ^ 010 ^ 011 ^ 100 = 000. Eve can remove any one of these numbers to make the XOR zero, ensuring Bob wins. Therefore, Bob can win once.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: With one '4' and no other numbers, the initial XOR is 4 = 100. Since the XOR is already non-zero, Alice wins immediately. Eve cannot change this outcome by removing the '4'. Therefore, Bob can win zero times.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
200 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
200
```
**Explanation**: With 200 '1's and no other numbers, the initial XOR is 1 ^ 1 ^ ... ^ 1 (200 times) = 0. Eve can remove pairs of identical numbers to keep the XOR zero, allowing Bob to win every time. Therefore, Bob can win 200 times.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With one '2', one '3', and one '4', the initial XOR is 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 = 010 ^ 011 ^ 100 = 001. Eve can remove any one of these numbers to make the XOR zero, ensuring Bob wins. Therefore, Bob can win once.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1 200
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With one '1', one '2', one '3', and 200 '4's, the initial XOR is 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 4 ^ ... ^ 4 (200 times) = 001 ^ 010 ^ 011 ^ 100 ^ 100 ^ ... ^ 100 (200 times) = 000. Eve can remove the '1' or '2' to make the XOR zero, ensuring Bob wins. Therefore, Bob can win once.
