```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Node 4 is the starting point. Hermione can move the stone from node 4 to node 3, and then Ron has no valid move. Thus, Hermione wins.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a more complex tree structure and single round.
**Input**: 
```

**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path with nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Node 5 is the starting point. Hermione can move the stone from node 5 to node 4, and then Ron has no valid move. Thus, Hermione wins.

# Test 4

```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path with nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Node 6 is the starting point. Hermione can move the stone from node 6 to node 5, and then Ron has no valid move. Thus, Hermione wins.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a tree having a loop and single round.
**Input**: 
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree forms a cycle with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 1. Node 1 is the starting point. Ron can move the stone from node 1 to node 2, and then Hermione can move the stone from node 2 to node 3, and then Ron can move the stone from node 3 to node 1 again. Since the tree is cyclic and both players play optimally, Ron will always have a move when Hermione does, so Ron wins.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a tree having a loop and single round, but starting at a different node.
**Input**: 
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree forms a cycle with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 1. Node 3 is the starting point. Hermione can move the stone from node 3 to node 1, and then Ron can move the stone from node 1 to node 2, and then Hermione can move the stone from node 2 to node 3 again. Since the tree is cyclic and both players play optimally, Hermione will always have a move when Ron does, so Hermione wins.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a tree having multiple paths and single round, but with a larger tree.
**Input**: 
```
8 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5

7 8
8
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path with nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Node 8 is the starting point. Hermione can move the stone from node 8 to node 7, and then Ron has no valid move. Thus, Hermione wins.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a tree having a large number of nodes and single round.
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path with nodes 1 through 10. Node 10 is the starting point. Hermione can move the stone from node 10 to node 9, and then Ron has no valid move. Thus, Hermione wins.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a tree having a large number of nodes and a different starting node.
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path with nodes 1 through 10. Node 1 is the starting point. Ron can move the stone from node 1 to node 2, and then Hermione can move the stone from node 2 to node 3, and then Ron can move the stone from node 3 to node 4, and so on, until Hermione has no valid move. Thus, Ron wins.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a tree having a large number of nodes and a different starting node, but with a different tree structure.
**Input**: 
```

Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple path with nodes 1 through 10. Node 5 is the starting point. Hermione can move the stone from node 5 to node 4, and then Ron can move the stone from node 4 to node 3, and then Hermione can move the stone from node 3 to node 2, and then Ron can move the stone from node 2 to node 1, and then Hermione can move the stone from node 1 to node 2 again. Since the tree is cyclic and both players play optimally, Hermione will always have a move when Ron does, so Hermione wins.

# Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a tree having a large number of nodes and a different starting node, but with a different tree structure, and a loop.
