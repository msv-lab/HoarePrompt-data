# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function with the smallest valid input values for n, k, and m.
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
a
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The only string of length 1 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet ('a') is 'a', and it occurs as a subsequence of 'a'.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function with the largest valid input value for n and m.
**Input**: 
```
1
26 26 1000
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' contains all 26 lowercase English alphabets, so all possible strings of length 26 can be found as subsequences.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function with n = k.
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 4
abba
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ('a', 'b') are 'aa', 'ab', 'ba', 'bb', and they all occur as subsequences of 'abba'.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function with n > k.
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2 4
abba
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
aa
```
**Explanation**: The string 'abba' cannot form all possible strings of length 3 using only the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ('a', 'b'). For example, 'aaa' does not occur as a subsequence.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function with n < k.
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3 4
abc
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets ('a', 'b', 'c') are 'aa', 'ab', 'ac', 'ba', 'bb', 'bc', 'ca', 'cb', 'cc', and they all occur as subsequences of 'abc'.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function with a string s that has fewer unique characters than k.
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4 4
aaab
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
bbb
```
**Explanation**: The string 'aaab' cannot form all possible strings of length 3 using the first 4 lowercase English alphabets ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd'). For example, 'bbb' does not occur as a subsequence.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function with a string s that has more unique characters than k.
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2 6
abcd
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
ccc
```
**Explanation**: The string 'abcd' cannot form all possible strings of length 3 using only the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ('a', 'b'). For example, 'ccc' does not occur as a subsequence.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function with a string s that is shorter than the required length n.
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2 2
ab
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
bb
```
**Explanation**: The string 'ab' cannot form all possible strings of length 3 using only the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ('a', 'b'). For example, 'bb' does not occur as a subsequence.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function with a string s that has no repeated characters but is still insufficient to form all possible strings of length n.
**Input**: 
```
1
4 3 4
abc
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
ccc
```
**Explanation**: The string 'abc' cannot form all possible strings of length 4 using only the first 3 lowercase English alphabets ('a', 'b', 'c'). For example, 'ccc' does not occur as a subsequence.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function with a string s that is exactly the same as the required string of length n.
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 4
abcd
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The string 'abcd' contains all 4 lowercase English alphabets, so all possible strings of length 4 can be found as subsequences.

# Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the function with a string s that is a permutation of the required string of length n.
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 4
dcba
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The string 'dcba' is a permutation of 'abcd', so all possible strings of length 4 can be found as subsequences.

# Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the function with a string s that is a very long string with many repetitions of the same character.
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 1000
aaaa
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
bb
```
**Explanation**: The string 'aaaa' cannot form all possible strings of length 2 using only the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ('a', 'b'). For example, 'bb' does not occur as a subsequence.

# Test 13
**Objective**: Verify the function with a string s that is a very long string with a mix of characters.
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 1000
abcabcabcabc
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The string 'abcabcabcabc' contains all 3 lowercase English alphabets, so all possible strings of length 3 can be found as subsequences.
