```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 10x20 rectangle can be cut into two 10x10 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 20x10 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
20 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 20x10 rectangle can be cut into two 10x10 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 20x10 rectangle, which is the same as the original but considering the problem statement, it still counts as forming a different rectangle.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 10x10 rectangle can be cut into two 10x5 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 5x20 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 10x5 rectangle can be cut into two 10x2.5 rectangles, but since the sides must be integers, it can be cut into two 10x2 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 20x2.5 rectangle, which is different from the original.
