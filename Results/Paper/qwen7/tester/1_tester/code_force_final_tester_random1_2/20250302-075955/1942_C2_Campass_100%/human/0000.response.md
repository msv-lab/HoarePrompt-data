To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test Case 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a small polygon and a few chosen vertices.

**Input**:
```
1
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: With 8 sides, 4 chosen vertices, and 2 additional vertices available, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is 6.

#### Test Case 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a medium-sized polygon and a moderate number of chosen vertices.

**Input**:
```
1
7 3 1
6 4 3
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Explanation**: With 7 sides, 3 chosen vertices, and 1 additional vertex available, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is 5.

#### Test Case 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a large polygon and a small number of chosen vertices.

**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 2 0
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: With 1,000,000,000 sides, 2 chosen vertices, and 0 additional vertices available, no triangles can be formed.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test Case 4
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the minimum number of sides.

**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides, 2 chosen vertices, and 0 additional vertices available, only 1 triangle can be formed.

#### Test Case 5
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the maximum number of chosen vertices.

**Input**:
```
1
10 9 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 10 sides, 9 chosen vertices, and 0 additional vertices available, only 1 triangle can be formed.

#### Test Case 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the maximum number of sides.

**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 2 1000000000
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1000000000 - 3
```
**Explanation**: With 1,000,000,000 sides, 2 chosen vertices, and up to 1,000,000,000 additional vertices available, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is \(1,000,000,000 - 3 = 999,999,997\).

#### Test Case 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the maximum number of additional vertices.

**Input**:
```
1
10 2 8
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
8
```
**Explanation**: With 10 sides, 2 chosen vertices, and 8 additional vertices available, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is 8.

#### Test Case 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where no additional vertices are needed.

**Input**:
```
1
6 3 0
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 6 sides, 3 chosen vertices, and 0 additional vertices available, only 1 triangle can be formed.

#### Test Case 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of additional vertices is zero.

**Input**:
```
1
5 2 0
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: With 5 sides, 2 chosen vertices, and 0 additional vertices available, no triangles can be formed.

#### Test Case 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of sides is equal to the number of chosen vertices plus one.

**Input**:
```
1
5 4 0
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 5 sides, 4 chosen vertices, and 0 additional vertices available, only 1 triangle can be formed.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
