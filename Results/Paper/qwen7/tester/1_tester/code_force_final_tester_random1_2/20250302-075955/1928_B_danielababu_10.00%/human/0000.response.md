# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Vasya can use the permutation [2, 1] to transform the array into [3, 3], making the number 3 appear twice.*

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
7 1 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Using the permutation [2, 3, 1, 4] transforms the array into [9, 4, 5, 5], making the number 5 appear twice.*

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
103 102 104
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: No permutation can make any number appear more than once, so the original array itself is the best, and the number 103 appears three times.*

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 101 1 100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Using the permutation [2, 1, 4, 3, 5] transforms the array into [2, 101, 2, 100, 2], making the number 2 appear twice.*

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 10 100 1000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: No permutation can make any number appear more than once, so the original array itself is the best, and the number 1 appears five times.*

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Using the permutation [2, 1] transforms the array into [4, 2], making the number 2 appear only once.*

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000000000 999999997 999999999
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Using the permutation [2, 3, 1] transforms the array into [1000000000, 999999999, 1000000001], making the number 1000000000 and 999999999 appear twice.*

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
1
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
3
```
*Explanation*: For the first test case, no permutation can change anything, so the number 1 appears once. For the second test case, the array is already in a form where each number appears once, so the number 1, 2, and 3 each appear once.*

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: Using the permutation [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] transforms the array into [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], making the number 2 appear five times.*

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The array is already in a form where each number appears once, so the number 1000000000 appears once.*

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: The array is already in a form where each number appears five times, so no permutation is needed, and the number 1 appears five times.*

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: The array is already in a form where each number appears twice, so no permutation is needed, and the numbers 1 and 2 each appear twice.*

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The array is already in a form where each number appears once, so the number 1000000000 appears once.*

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The array is already in a form where each number appears once, so no permutation is needed, and the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 each appear once.*

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Using the permutation [2, 1, 3] transforms the array into [2, 1, 2], making the number 2 appear twice.*
