To address the given problem, we need to create test cases that cover both basic and edge scenarios. Below are the comprehensive test cases for the described problem.

### Test 1: Single Node Tree
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the tree has only one node.

**Input**:
```
1
1
```

**Output**:
```
1
1 0
```

### Test 2: Two Node Tree
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the tree has two nodes connected by an edge.

**Input**:
```
1
2
1 2
```

**Output**:
```
2
1 1
2 1
```

### Test 3: Four Node Tree
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the tree forms a star structure (one central node connected to three other nodes).

**Input**:
```
1
4
1 2
1 3
1 4
```

**Output**:
```
3
1 1
2 1
3 1
4 1
```

### Test 4: Four Node Tree with Different Structure
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the tree is structured differently (e.g., a path of four nodes).

**Input**:
```
1
4
1 2
2 3
3 4
```

**Output**:
```
4
1 1
2 2
3 1
4 1
```

### Test 5: Seven Node Tree with Multiple Paths
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the tree has multiple paths and branches.

**Input**:
```
1
7
2 7
3 2
6 4
5 7
1 6
6 7
```

**Output**:
```
3
6 1
7 1
2 1
```

### Test 6: Large Tree with Multiple Branches
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with a larger tree having multiple branches.

**Input**:
```
1
8
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 7
7 8
```

**Output**:
```
4
1 1
2 2
3 1
4 1
```

### Test 7: Tree with All Nodes at Maximum Distance
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when all nodes are at the maximum possible distance from the root.

**Input**:
```
1
5
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
```

**Output**:
```
5
1 1
2 2
3 1
4 1
5 1
```

### Test 8: Tree with a Single Path and One Node at Maximum Distance
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the tree has a single path but one node is at the maximum distance.

**Input**:
```
1
5
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
```

**Output**:
```
5
1 1
2 2
3 1
4 1
5 1
```

### Test 9: Tree with Multiple Paths and One Node at Maximum Distance
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the tree has multiple paths and one node is at the maximum distance.

**Input**:
```
1
7
2 7
3 2
6 4
5 7
1 6
6 7
```

**Output**:
```
3
6 1
7 1
2 1
```

### Test 10: Tree with a Single Path and All Nodes at Maximum Distance
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the tree has a single path and all nodes are at the maximum distance.

**Input**:
```
1
5
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
```

**Output**:
```
5
1 1
2 2
3 1
4 1
5 1
```

These test cases cover various scenarios, including single-node trees, small trees with different structures, and larger trees with multiple branches. They help ensure that the solution is robust and handles all edge cases appropriately.
