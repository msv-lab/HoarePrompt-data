# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 2
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 2 \), the optimal arrangement is to place the points at (1,1) and (1,2). This maximizes the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) to \(\{0, 1\}\).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 3 \), the optimal arrangement is to place the points at (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1). This maximizes the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) to \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```

4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 3
4 3
4 4
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 4 \), the optimal arrangement is to place the points at (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), and (4,4). This maximizes the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) to \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```

5
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1

1 4
2 1
5 5
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 5 \), the optimal arrangement is to place the points at (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), and (5,5). This maximizes the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) to \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\).

# Test 5

```
**Output**: 
```
1 4

6 1
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 6 \), the optimal arrangement is to place the points at (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (5,2), (5,5), and (6,1). This maximizes the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) to \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
1 1

2 1
2 3
3 1
```
*Explanation*: This test checks the function for multiple test cases. It verifies that the function correctly handles two different values of \( n \) (2 and 3) and outputs the correct arrangements for each.

# Test 7

1 4
1 5
1 6
5 2
5 5
6 1
```
*Explanation*: This test checks the function for five different values of \( n \) (2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) to ensure it consistently produces the correct arrangements for each value.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1000
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1000
1000 1
1000 1000
```
*Explanation*: This test checks the function for the maximum value of \( n \) (1000). The optimal arrangement for large \( n \) is to place the points at (1,1), (1,n), (n,1), and (n,n). This maximizes the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) to include all values from 0 to \( n-1 \).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 2
```
*Explanation*: This test is a duplicate of Test 1 but included to ensure the function handles repeated inputs consistently.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
*Explanation*: This test is a duplicate of Test 2 but included to ensure the function handles repeated inputs consistently.
