# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
**Explanation**: There are 7 sticks, and any combination of 3 sticks can form a triangle since all sticks have the same length.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The possible combinations are (3, 2, 1) and (3, 3, 1), but only (3, 2, 1) and (3, 3, 1) can form triangles.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The possible combinations are (1, 2, 3), which cannot form a triangle.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Only one stick is available, so no combination of 3 sticks can be formed.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
3
0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
20
0
```
**Explanation**: For the first test case, the valid combinations are those where the sum of the smallest two sides is greater than the largest side. For the second test case, there are no valid combinations.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```

8
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
56
```
**Explanation**: All sticks have the same length, and any combination of 3 sticks can form a triangle.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The longest stick is 32, and no combination of 3 sticks can satisfy the triangle inequality.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
84
```
**Explanation**: The valid combinations are those where the sum of the two smaller sides is greater than the largest side.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
120
```
**Explanation**: The valid combinations are those where the sum of the two smaller sides is greater than the largest side.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: All sticks have the same length, and any combination of 3 sticks can form a triangle.
