1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
```
**Output**: 
```

```
**Explanation**: 
- The initial arrays are `a = [1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200, 2700]` and `b = [800, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2200, 3000]`.
- After proposing a problem with difficulty `w = 800`, `a` becomes `[800, 1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200]`.
- After proposing a problem with difficulty `w = 1800`, `a` becomes `[800, 1000, 1400, 1800, 2000, 2000]`.
- It is proven that it is impossible to achieve the goal with fewer new problems.

**Explanation**: 
- The initial arrays are `a = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and `b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- After proposing a problem with difficulty `w = 1`, `a` becomes `[1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.
- After proposing a problem with difficulty `w = 2`, `a` becomes `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
- After proposing a problem with difficulty `w = 3`, `a` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- It is proven that it is impossible to achieve the goal with fewer new problems.

# Test 3

1000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- The initial arrays are `a = [1000]` and `b = [1000]`.
- Since `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i`, no new problems are needed.
