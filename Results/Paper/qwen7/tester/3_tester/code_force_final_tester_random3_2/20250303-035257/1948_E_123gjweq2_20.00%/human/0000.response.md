# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with the smallest possible input values.
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: With \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = 2 \). The condition \( |1 - 2| + |1 - 2| \le 3 \) holds true, so the graph is fully connected. Thus, only one clique is needed.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a slightly larger input.
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4
```
**Output**: 
```
3 1 5 2 4
2
1 1 2 1 2
```
**Explanation**: With \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 4 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 3 \), \( a_3 = 5 \), \( a_4 = 2 \), and \( a_5 = 4 \). The pairs \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), \((2, 3)\), \((4, 5)\), and \((3, 4)\) satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 4 \). Therefore, we can partition the graph into two cliques: \(\{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(\{4, 5\}\).

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a larger but still manageable input.
**Input**: 
```
1
8 16
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: With \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 16 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 2 \), \( a_3 = 3 \), \( a_4 = 4 \), \( a_5 = 5 \), \( a_6 = 6 \), \( a_7 = 7 \), and \( a_8 = 8 \). Since \( k = 16 \) is very large, all pairs will satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 16 \). Hence, the entire graph forms a single clique.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when \( n \) is at its maximum value.
**Input**: 
```
1
40 40
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 ... 39 40
1
1 1 1 ... 1 1
```
**Explanation**: With \( n = 40 \) and \( k = 40 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 2 \), ..., \( a_{40} = 40 \). Since \( k = 40 \) is the maximum possible value, all pairs will satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 40 \). Hence, the entire graph forms a single clique.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when \( k \) is at its minimum value.
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4
2
1 1 2 2
```
**Explanation**: With \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 1 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 2 \), \( a_3 = 3 \), and \( a_4 = 4 \). The pairs \((1, 2)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 4)\) do not satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 1 \), but the pairs \((1, 3)\) and \((2, 4)\) do. Therefore, we can partition the graph into two cliques: \(\{1, 3\}\) and \(\{2, 4\}\).

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a combination of small \( n \) and large \( k \).
**Input**: 
```
1
3 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3
1
1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: With \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 2 \), and \( a_3 = 3 \). Since \( k = 10 \) is large, all pairs will satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 10 \). Hence, the entire graph forms a single clique.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a combination of large \( n \) and small \( k \).
**Input**: 
```
1
20 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 ... 19 20
2
1 1 2 2 ... 19 19 20 20
```
**Explanation**: With \( n = 20 \) and \( k = 2 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 2 \), ..., \( a_{20} = 20 \). The pairs \((1, 2)\), \((2, 3)\), ..., \((19, 20)\) do not satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 2 \), but the pairs \((1, 3)\), \((2, 4)\), ..., \((18, 20)\) do. Therefore, we can partition the graph into two cliques: \(\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19\}\) and \(\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20\}\).

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a combination of medium \( n \) and medium \( k \).
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 ... 9 10
2
1 1 2 2 ... 9 9 10 10
```
**Explanation**: With \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 10 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 2 \), ..., \( a_{10} = 10 \). The pairs \((1, 2)\), \((2, 3)\), ..., \((9, 10)\) do not satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 10 \), but the pairs \((1, 3)\), \((2, 4)\), ..., \((8, 10)\) do. Therefore, we can partition the graph into two cliques: \(\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}\) and \(\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}\).

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a combination of large \( n \) and large \( k \).
**Input**: 
```
1
20 20
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 ... 19 20
1
1 1 1 ... 1 1
```
**Explanation**: With \( n = 20 \) and \( k = 20 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 2 \), ..., \( a_{20} = 20 \). Since \( k = 20 \) is the maximum possible value, all pairs will satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 20 \). Hence, the entire graph forms a single clique.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a combination of small \( n \) and small \( k \).
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3
3
1 2 3
```
**Explanation**: With \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 1 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 2 \), and \( a_3 = 3 \). The pairs \((1, 2)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((1, 3)\) do not satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 1 \). Therefore, we need to partition the graph into three cliques: \(\{1\}\), \(\{2\}\), and \(\{3\}\).
