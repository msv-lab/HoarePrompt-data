# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a simple case where no additional problem is needed.
**Input**:
```

5 1 1
5 10 15 20 26
11
4
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The original array is already sorted, and the difference between consecutive elements is 5. Adding any model with function will increase the complexity, but the minimum difference remains 5.

5 10 15 20 26
1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
