1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The optimal split is \( s = [2, 4, 5] \) and \( t = [1, 3] \). The penalty is \( p(s) + p(t) = 2 + 1 = 3 \).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
8
8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The optimal split is \( s = [8, 3, 1] \) and \( t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3] \). The penalty is \( p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 1 = 1 \).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The optimal split is \( s = [] \) and \( t = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3] \). The penalty is \( p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0 \).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The array has only one element, so the penalty is 0.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The optimal split is \( s = [2] \) and \( t = [1] \). The penalty is \( p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0 \).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2
4
1 2 3 4
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
0
```
*Explanation*: For the first test case, the optimal split is \( s = [2, 4] \) and \( t = [1, 3] \). The penalty is \( p(s) + p(t) = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
For the second test case, the optimal split is \( s = [2] \) and \( t = [1, 3] \). The penalty is \( p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0 \).

```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
*Explanation*: The optimal split is \( s = [2, 4, 6, 8] \) and \( t = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] \). The penalty is \( p(s) + p(t) = 3 + 3 = 6 \).

```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
*Explanation*: The optimal split is \( s = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] \) and \( t = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] \). The penalty is \( p(s) + p(t) = 4 + 5 = 9 \).

10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
*Explanation*: The optimal split is \( s = [10, 8, 6, 4, 2] \) and \( t = [9, 7, 5, 3, 1] \). The penalty is \( p(s) + p(t) = 4 + 5 = 9 \).

```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```

10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: The optimal split is \( s = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] \) and \( t = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11] \). The penalty is \( p(s) + p(t) = 4 + 6 = 10 \).
