To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when all counts are zero.
**Input**:
```
0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: If there are no ones, twos, threes, or fours, the sequence is empty initially, and Bob cannot win.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when only ones are present.
**Input**:
```
1 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With only one '1', the XOR of the sequence is non-zero, so Alice wins initially. Bob cannot win.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when only twos are present.
**Input**:
```
0 1 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With only one '2', the XOR of the sequence is non-zero, so Alice wins initially. Bob cannot win.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when only threes are present.
**Input**:
```
0 0 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With only one '3', the XOR of the sequence is non-zero, so Alice wins initially. Bob cannot win.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when only fours are present.
**Input**:
```
0 0 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With only one '4', the XOR of the sequence is non-zero, so Alice wins initially. Bob cannot win.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when all types of numbers are present in equal quantities.
**Input**:
```
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With one '1', one '2', one '3', and one '4', the XOR of the sequence is non-zero, so Alice wins initially. Bob cannot win.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the number of elements is very large but still results in Alice winning.
**Input**:
```
200 200 200 200
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Even with a large number of elements, the XOR of the sequence is non-zero if there is at least one '1', '2', '3', or '4'. Bob cannot win.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the number of elements is very large and results in Bob winning.
**Input**:
```
200 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
200
```
**Explanation**: If there are only '2's, removing them one by one will eventually result in Bob winning 200 times.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the number of elements is very large and includes a mix of numbers.
**Input**:
```
100 100 100 100
```
**Output**:
```
100
```
**Explanation**: If there are 100 of each type of number, removing them optimally will result in Bob winning 100 times.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the number of elements is very small but still results in Bob winning.
**Input**:
```
0 0 0 200
```
**Output**:
```
200
```
**Explanation**: If there are only '4's, removing them one by one will result in Bob winning 200 times.

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the number of elements is very small and results in Alice winning.
**Input**:
```
200 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: If there are only '2's, removing them one by one will result in Bob winning once.
