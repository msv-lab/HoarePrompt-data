# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality for \( n = 1 \).
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: For \( n = 1 \), the matrix is a single element. Setting \( a_{1,1} = 1 \) gives the maximum possible sum of 1, which can be achieved with a single operation of type 1.
