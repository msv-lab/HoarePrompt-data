# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There is 1 application with a 1x1 icon and 1 application with a 2x2 icon. The 2x2 icon will occupy one entire screen, and the 1x1 icon will fit in the remaining space of that same screen.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
7 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There are 7 applications with 1x1 icons and 2 applications with 2x2 icons. The 2x2 icons will occupy 2 screens, but the 1x1 icons can fill the remaining space on those screens without needing an additional screen.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
12 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: There are 12 applications with 1x1 icons and 4 applications with 2x2 icons. Since 4 * 4 = 16 cells are needed for the 2x2 icons, they will occupy 2 screens. The 12 1x1 icons can fill the remaining space on these 2 screens without needing an additional screen.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
0 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: There are no 1x1 icons and 3 applications with 2x2 icons. Since 3 * 4 = 12 cells are needed for the 2x2 icons, they will occupy 3 screens, but we only need 2 screens as each screen can have 4 icons.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There is 1 application with a 1x1 icon and no applications with 2x2 icons. The 1x1 icon will fit in one screen.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
15 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
8 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: There are 8 applications with 1x1 icons and 2 applications with 2x2 icons. The 2x2 icons will occupy 2 screens, and the 1x1 icons can fill the remaining space on those 2 screens without needing an additional screen.
