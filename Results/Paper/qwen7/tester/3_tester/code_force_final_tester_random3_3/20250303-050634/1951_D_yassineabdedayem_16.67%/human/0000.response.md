# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when Alice has enough coins to buy the required number of jewels without any stalls.
**Input**: 
```
1
100 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
10
```
**Explanation**: Alice has 100 coins and needs to buy 10 jewels. If Bob sets the price of each jewel to 10 coins, Alice can buy exactly 10 jewels and have no coins left.

# Test 2
