```
2
```

**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
10 15 5 20 25
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Cow 3 starts in position 3 with a rating of 5. By swapping with the cow in position 2 (15), it can win all matches.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the cow is the last cow and can potentially win all matches.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: Cow 5 starts in position 5 with the highest rating (5). It can win all four matches.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the cow is the first cow and can potentially win all matches.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: Cow 1 starts in position 1 with the highest rating (1). It can win all four matches.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the cow is the second cow and can potentially win all matches after a swap.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: Cow 2 starts in position 2 with the second-highest rating (2). By swapping with the cow in position 1 (1), it can win all four matches.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the cow is the second-to-last cow and can potentially win all matches after a swap.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 4
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: Cow 4 starts in position 4 with the fourth-highest rating (4). By swapping with the cow in position 5 (5), it can win all four matches.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the cow is the second-to-last cow and can win some matches without a swap.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 4
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Cow 4 starts in position 4 with the fourth-highest rating (4). It can win against the cow in position 5 (1) but lose against the cow in position 3 (3).

# Test 10
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the cow is the second cow and can win some matches without a swap.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 2
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Cow 2 starts in position 2 with the second-highest rating (4). It can win against the cow in position 1 (5) but lose against the cow in position 3 (3).

# Test 11
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the cow is the last cow and cannot win any matches even with a swap.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Cow 5 starts in position 5 with the highest rating (1). It cannot win any matches because all other cows have higher ratings.

# Test 12
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the cow is the first cow and cannot win any matches even with a swap.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Cow 1 starts in position 1 with the highest rating (5). It cannot win any matches because all other cows have lower ratings.

# Test 13
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the cow is in the middle and cannot win any matches even with a swap.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Cow 3 starts in position 3 with the third-highest rating (3). It cannot win any matches because all other cows have higher ratings.

# Test 14
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when there are duplicate ratings (though the problem guarantees distinct ratings, this is a good edge case to consider).

**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
1 2 3 3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Cow 3 starts in position 3 with a rating of 3. It can win against the cow in position 4 (3) but lose against the cow in position 2 (2).

# Test 15
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the cow is in the middle and can win some matches after a swap with a duplicate rating.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
2 3 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Cow 3 starts in position 3 with a rating of 3. By swapping with the cow in position 2 (2), it can win all matches.
