# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [2, 2, 8] is 2. By increasing the first element to 3, the array becomes [3, 2, 8], and the median becomes 3. This requires 1 operation.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
7 3 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [7, 3, 3, 1] is 3. By increasing the last two elements to 2, the array becomes [7, 3, 3, 2], and the median becomes 3. This requires 2 operations.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The array has only one element, so no operations are needed to change the median since there is no other element to compare with.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5. By increasing the last element to 6, the array becomes [5, 5, 5, 4, 6], and the median remains 5. However, we need to increase the third element to 6 to make sure the median increases to 6. This requires 3 operations.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
2 1 2 3 1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2. By increasing the first and third elements to 3, the array becomes [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4], and the median becomes 3. This requires 2 operations.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1, 2] is 1. By increasing the first element to 2, the array becomes [2, 2], and the median becomes 2. This requires 1 operation.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1, 1] is 1. By increasing the first and second elements to 2, the array becomes [2, 2], and the median becomes 2. This requires 2 operations.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The array has all elements equal, so no operations are needed to change the median since it is already the maximum possible value.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
3
3
1 2 3
4
1 2 3 4
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
0
```
*Explanation*: In each case, the array is already sorted, and the median is already the middle value, so no operations are needed.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
3
3
3 2 1
4
4 3 2 1
5
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
1
```
*Explanation*: In each case, the array is sorted in descending order, and the median is the smallest value. By increasing the smallest value, the median will increase. This requires 1 operation.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
3
3
2 2 1
4
3 3 2 1
5
4 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
1
```
*Explanation*: In each case, the array has duplicate elements, but the median is still the smallest value. By increasing the smallest value, the median will increase. This requires 1 operation.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
3
3
1 1 1
4
1 1 1 1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
4
5
```
*Explanation*: In each case, all elements are the same, and the median is the smallest value. By increasing each element, the median will increase. This requires the number of operations equal to the number of elements in the array.
