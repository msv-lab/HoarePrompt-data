2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 2
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 2 \), the optimal arrangement is to place cells at positions (1,1) and (1,2). This maximizes the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\).

3
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 3 \), the optimal arrangement is to place cells at positions (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1). This maximizes the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

# Test 3

**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 3
4 3
4 4
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 4 \), the optimal arrangement is to place cells at positions (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), and (4,4). This maximizes the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\).

# Test 4
**Input**:

2 1
5 5
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 5 \), the optimal arrangement is to place cells at positions (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), and (5,5). This maximizes the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\).

# Test 5

6 1
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 6 \), the optimal arrangement is to place cells at positions (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (5,2), (5,5), and (6,1). This maximizes the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 2

2 1
2 3
3 1
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the function's ability to handle multiple test cases. The first test case is for \( n = 2 \) and the second for \( n = 3 \), both of which are already covered in previous test cases.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 2
...
1 1000
1000 1
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 1000 \), the optimal arrangement is to place cells along the main diagonal and anti-diagonal. This maximizes the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, 1998\}\).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
2 2
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks if the function handles the case when the input is invalid or non-optimal. For \( n = 2 \), the correct output should be placing cells at (1,1) and (1,2), not (1,1) and (2,2).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
2 3
3 2
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks if the function handles the case when the input is invalid or non-optimal. For \( n = 3 \), the correct output should be placing cells at (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1), not (2,1), (2,3), and (3,2).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 3
4 3
5 4
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks if the function handles the case when the input is invalid or non-optimal. For \( n = 4 \), the correct output should be placing cells at (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), and (4,4), not (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), and (5,4).

These test cases cover basic and edge scenarios to ensure the robustness, reliability, and scalability of the solution.
