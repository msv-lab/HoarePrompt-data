**Output**: 
```

```
*Explanation*: If the road is laid after the first house, there will be one resident on the left side who wants to live on the right side. This does not satisfy the condition. If the road is laid after the second house, both residents on the left side and the resident on the right side are satisfied, making it the optimal solution.

# Test 2

```
*Explanation*: Laying the road after the third house ensures that at least half of the residents on both sides are satisfied. On the left side (houses 1, 2, 3), there are 2 residents (0, 1, 0), and on the right side (houses 4, 5, 6), there are 3 residents (1, 1, 1). Both sides have at least half of their residents satisfied.
