# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
**Explanation**: All combinations of three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle since all sticks have the same length.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The only valid combinations are (1st stick, 2nd stick, 4th stick) and (1st stick, 3rd stick, 4th stick).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No combination of three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle because the sum of the lengths of any two sticks is not greater than the length of the third stick.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Only one stick is given, so no combination of three sticks can be formed.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
3
0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
20
0
```
**Explanation**: For the first test case, the valid combinations are those where the sum of the two smaller lengths is greater than the largest length. For the second test case, no valid combination exists.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All sticks have zero length, so no combination can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5
2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: Any three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle since all sticks have the same length.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Only two sticks are given, so no combination of three sticks can be formed.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
8
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**: 
```
56
```
**Explanation**: The valid combinations are those where the sum of the two smaller lengths is greater than the largest length.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
120
```
**Explanation**: The valid combinations are those where the sum of the two smaller lengths is greater than the largest length.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Only one stick is given, so no combination of three sticks can be formed.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The only non-zero length is 1, but no combination of three sticks can be formed.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 1 1 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
**Explanation**: The valid combinations involve at least one stick of length 1 and two sticks of length 2.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The combination (1, 1, 2) cannot form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The only valid combination is (2, 2, 2).

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The valid combinations are (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 5), (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 5), (1, 4, 5), (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 5), (2, 4, 5), (3, 4, 5).
