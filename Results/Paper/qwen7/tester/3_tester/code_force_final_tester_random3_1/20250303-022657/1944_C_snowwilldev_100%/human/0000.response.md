# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the scenario where the array has only one element, and Alice can pick it, resulting in a MEX of 0.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: This test case verifies the scenario where the array has two elements, and Alice can pick either, leading to a MEX of 1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the scenario where the array has three distinct elements, and Alice can pick any, leading to a MEX of 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: This test case ensures that when the array contains consecutive numbers from 0 to n-1, Alice can always pick an element to achieve a MEX of 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Similar to Test 5, this test case checks the scenario with consecutive numbers, but with an additional element, ensuring the MEX remains 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the scenario where all elements in the array are the same, allowing Alice to pick any element, resulting in a MEX of 0.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: This test case is a duplicate of Test 2 but serves to ensure consistency in the implementation.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the scenario where there are duplicate elements, ensuring the MEX is correctly calculated.

**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the scenario where there are repeated elements, ensuring the MEX is correctly calculated despite duplicates.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the scenario with repeated elements at the end, ensuring the MEX is correctly calculated.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 1 2 3 4 4
```

**Input**: 
```
1
7
0 1 2 3 4 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the scenario with repeated elements at the end, ensuring the MEX is correctly calculated.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
8
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 6
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the scenario with repeated elements at the end, ensuring the MEX is correctly calculated.

**Input**: 
```
1
9
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
