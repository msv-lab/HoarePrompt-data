# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 3
1 2 3
```

**Explanation**: This is a basic test case where the graph forms a triangle with all edges having the same weight. The smallest edge weight is 1, and the cycle includes all three vertices.

4 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 3
1 2 3
```

**Explanation**: This test case checks if the algorithm can handle a graph where the smallest edge is part of multiple cycles but still selects the correct cycle.
