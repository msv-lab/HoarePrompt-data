To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic case where all participants have clear preferences and can be accommodated.
**Input**:
```
1
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: 1 introvert needs 1 tent, 2 extroverts need 1 tent (with 1 universal), and 2 universals need 1 tent (shared).

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the case where there are more extroverts than universals, making it impossible to satisfy all preferences.
**Input**:
```
1
1 4 1
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: 1 introvert needs 1 tent, 4 extroverts need 2 tents (2 extroverts per tent), but there is only 1 universal available, which is insufficient.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the case where there are enough universals to accommodate all extroverts.
**Input**:
```
1
1 4 2
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: 1 introvert needs 1 tent, 4 extroverts need 2 tents (2 extroverts per tent), and 2 universals can share the remaining tent.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the case where there is only 1 introvert and no extroverts or universals.
**Input**:
```
1
1 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: 1 introvert needs 1 tent.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the case where there is only 1 extrovert and no introverts or universals.
**Input**:
```
1
0 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: 1 extrovert cannot find 2 others to share a tent.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the case where there is only 1 universal and no introverts or extroverts.
**Input**:
```
1
0 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No tents are needed since there are no participants.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the case where there are large numbers of participants.
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
1666666667
```
**Explanation**: 1 billion introverts need 1 billion tents, 1 billion extroverts need 3333333334 tents (since 1 billion / 3 = 3333333333.3333, rounding up gives 3333333334), and 1 billion universals can share the remaining tents. Total: 1666666667 tents.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the case where there are zero participants.
**Input**:
```
1
0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No tents are needed since there are no participants.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the case where there are only introverts and universals.
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 0 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
1000000000
```
**Explanation**: 1 billion introverts need 1 billion tents, and 1 billion universals can share the remaining tents. Total: 1 billion tents.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the case where there are only extroverts and universals.
**Input**:
```
1
0 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
500000000
```
**Explanation**: 1 billion extroverts need 3333333334 tents, and 1 billion universals can share the remaining tents. Total: 500000000 tents.

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the case where there are only introverts and extroverts.
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1000000000 0
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: 1 billion introverts need 1 billion tents, and 1 billion extroverts need 3333333334 tents, but there are no universals to share the remaining tents.

#### Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the case where there are only introverts and universals with a small number of extroverts.
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 1 introvert needs 1 tent, 1 extrovert needs 1 tent (with 1 universal), and 1 universal can share the remaining tent.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios from basic to edge cases, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
