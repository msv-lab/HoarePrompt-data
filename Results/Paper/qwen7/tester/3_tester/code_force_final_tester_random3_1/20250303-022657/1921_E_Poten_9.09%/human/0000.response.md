To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

1. **Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start near each other but far enough to avoid immediate capture.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     6 5 2 2 5 3
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Alice
     ```

2. **Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Bob starts directly below Alice, and Alice can win on her next move.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     4 1 2 1 4 1
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Alice
     ```

3. **Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start in the same column but different rows, and Alice can win on her next move.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     1 4 1 3 1 1
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Alice
     ```

4. **Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start in the same row but different columns, and Alice can win on her next move.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     5 5 1 4 5 2
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Alice
     ```

5. **Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start in such a way that neither can win immediately, and the game ends in a draw.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     4 4 1 1 4 4
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Draw
     ```

### Edge Test Cases

1. **Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice is in the last row and cannot move further.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     10 10 10 5 1 5
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Draw
     ```

2. **Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Bob is in the first row and cannot move further.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     10 10 5 5 1 5
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Draw
     ```

3. **Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start in the same column but different rows, and Bob can win on his next move.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     10 10 9 1 8 1
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Bob
     ```

4. **Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start in the same row but different columns, and Bob can win on his next move.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     10 10 8 1 10 2
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Bob
     ```

5. **Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start very close to each other, and Alice can win on her next move.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     10 10 1 1 2 1
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Alice
     ```

6. **Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start very close to each other, and Bob can win on his next move.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     10 10 1 3 4 1
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Bob
     ```

7. **Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start very close to each other, and the game ends in a draw.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     10 10 3 1 1 1
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Draw
     ```
