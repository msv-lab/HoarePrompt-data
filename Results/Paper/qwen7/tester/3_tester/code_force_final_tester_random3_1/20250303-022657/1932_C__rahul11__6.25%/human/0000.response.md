```
1
5 1
1 1 1 1 1
LLLLL
```
**Output**: 
```
0 0 0 0 0 
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the modulo value is 1, which always results in 0 after any multiplication.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
6 8
1 2 3 4 5 6
RLLLRR
```
**Output**: 
```
0 0 0 4 4 4 
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the removal of elements from both ends and the correct handling of the product calculation.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10000
10000
R
```
**Output**: 
```
0 
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario with the smallest possible array size (n=1) and the smallest possible modulo value (m=10000), ensuring the function handles single-element arrays correctly.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1
1
R
3 10
1 2 3
RRR
```
**Output**: 
```
0 
0 0 0 
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function with multiple test cases in a single input, ensuring the function can handle multiple independent cases without interference.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
1 2
LR
```
**Output**: 
```
0 0 
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the product modulo operation results in 0 early on, and subsequent operations still produce 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
LLLLLLLLLL
```
**Output**: 
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when the array size is large but the modulo value is also large, ensuring no overflow issues.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10000
10000
L
```
**Output**: 
```
0 
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the only element in the array is equal to the modulo value, resulting in a product of 0 immediately.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10000
10000
R
```
**Output**: 
```
0 
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the only element in the array is equal to the modulo value, resulting in a product of 0 immediately, but with the removal operation.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10000
10000
R
```
**Output**: 
```
0 
```
**Explanation**: This test case is a duplicate of Test 9 but included to ensure the function handles repeated identical inputs gracefully.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10000
10000
L
```
**Output**: 
```
0 
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the only element in the array is equal to the modulo value, resulting in a product of 0 immediately, but with the removal operation from the left.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
1 1
RR
```
**Output**: 
```
0 0 
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the product modulo operation results in 0 early on, and subsequent operations still produce 0, with both elements being 1.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
1 2
RL
```
**Output**: 
```
0 0 
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the product modulo operation results in 0 early on, and subsequent operations still produce 0, with one element being 1 and the other being 2.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
1 2 3
RRL
```
**Output**: 
```
0 0 0 
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the product modulo operation results in 0 early on, and subsequent operations still produce 0, with the array size being 3.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 2
RL
```
**Output**: 
```
0 0 
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the modulo value is 1, ensuring the function handles this edge case correctly.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, from basic to edge cases, ensuring the function's robustness and reliability.
