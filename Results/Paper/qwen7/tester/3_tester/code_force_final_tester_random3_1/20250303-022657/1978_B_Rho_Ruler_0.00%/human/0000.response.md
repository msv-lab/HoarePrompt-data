```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000000
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 1000000000 \). Then he will sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of \( 1000000000 + 999999999 + \ldots + 1 = 1000000000000000000 \) coins.

# Test 6

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 1 \). Then he will sell one bun for 2 coins, and the other at the usual price for 1 coin. The total profit is \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) coins, but since \( k \) cannot exceed the number of buns, the maximum profit is \( 1 \) coin.

# Test 10
**Input**:

```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 1 \). Then he will sell one bun for 1 coin, and the other at the usual price for 2 coins. The total profit is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \) coins, but since \( k \) cannot exceed the number of buns, the maximum profit is \( 2 \) coins.

# Test 11
