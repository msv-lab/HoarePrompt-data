Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `j` is `j_prev + 2`, `k` is `j`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code, the only effect is that the execution will exit the current context (implied by the presence of `break`). The values of `b`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
