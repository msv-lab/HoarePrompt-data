Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0; `k` is equal to `j`; `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`**

The value of `k` is now set to the value of `j`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, `b` must still be greater than 0, and `d[j]` should still not be found within the slice `e[k:]` (which is now `e[j:]`).
