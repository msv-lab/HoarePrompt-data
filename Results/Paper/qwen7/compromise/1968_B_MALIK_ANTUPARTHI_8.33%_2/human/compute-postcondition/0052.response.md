Postcondition: `i` is 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `e` is an input string, and `k` is either `j + 1` or `j`, depending on whether the character at index `j` of `d` is found in the substring starting from index `k` of `e`. If the character is found or if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
