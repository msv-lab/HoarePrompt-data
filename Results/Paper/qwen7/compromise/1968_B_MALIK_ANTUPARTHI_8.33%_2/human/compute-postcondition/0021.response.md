Output State: **`k` is `j` + 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is the second integer input from the user, `j` is 0, `c` is the third integer input from the user, `d` is the third integer input from the user, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no loop or conditional statement is specified, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. All other variables retain their initial states.
