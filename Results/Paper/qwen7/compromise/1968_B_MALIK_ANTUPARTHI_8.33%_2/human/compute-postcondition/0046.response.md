Output State: **`i` is 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `e` is an input string, `k` is `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, or `k`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
