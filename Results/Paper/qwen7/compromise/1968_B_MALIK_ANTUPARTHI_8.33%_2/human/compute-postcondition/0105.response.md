Postcondition: `b` must be greater than 0, `j` is `j_prev + 1`. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is `j + 2`, and either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, causing the most internal loop or if statement to break. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is `j`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
