Postcondition: **`k` is `e.index(d[j]) + 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is the first integer input from the user, `j` is 0, `c` is the second integer input from the user, `d` is the third integer input from the user, `e` is an input from the user, and either `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`. The current value of `d[j]` is in the slice of `e` starting from index `k`.**
