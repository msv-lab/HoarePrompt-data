Reasoning:
The provided program only checks if the second-to-last character of the second row's string is not '<'. This logic is insufficient to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) because it does not consider the entire path the robot takes through the grid.

For the robot to reach (2, n), it must follow a series of moves that ultimately lead it to that position. The program's current logic fails to account for the sequence of moves required to traverse the grid correctly. It only checks one specific condition, which is not enough to guarantee that the robot can reach the target cell.

Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **False**
