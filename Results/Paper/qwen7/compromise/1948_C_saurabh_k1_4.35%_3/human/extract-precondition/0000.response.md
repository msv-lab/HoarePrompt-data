Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; the first line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the second line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**
