Output State: **`i` is `x`, `s` is 1, `x` is `x + 1`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers from input**

Explanation: The line `s = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `s`. The values of `i`, `x`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. The initial value of `s` was \(2^x - 1\), but it is now overwritten by the value 1. The value of `x` is updated to `x + 1` due to the initial state, but this update is not reflected in the current line of code.
