Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be greater than 1, `s` is 2 * `s // (k - 1) + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated by adding its value divided by `(k - 1)` plus 1 to itself. Given the initial state where `s` is `s // (k - 1) + 1`, the new value of `s` becomes `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`. Since `s` was initially `s // (k - 1) + 1`, the updated value of `s` is `2 * (s // (k - 1) + 1)`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.
