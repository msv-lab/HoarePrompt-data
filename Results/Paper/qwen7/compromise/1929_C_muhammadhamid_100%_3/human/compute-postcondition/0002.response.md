Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `k` is set to the first integer input, `x` is set to the second integer input, `a` is set to the third integer input, `s` is 1.**

The code `s = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `s`. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
