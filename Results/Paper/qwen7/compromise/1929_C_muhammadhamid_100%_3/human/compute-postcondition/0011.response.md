Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the variables and their values:

- The loop will execute `x` times.
- After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `x-1`.
- `x` remains unchanged.
- `s` will be \(2^x - 1\).

Given these conditions, we need to determine the value of `a` and `s` to evaluate the expression inside the `print` statement: `'Yes' if a >= s else 'No'`.

From the description, `s` is explicitly defined as \(2^x - 1\). This means `s` will have the value \(2^x - 1\) after the loop completes.

However, the value of `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `a` is not further constrained or initialized in the given information, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we will express the output in terms of `a` and `s`.

The `print` statement checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`. Given `s = 2^x - 1`, the output will depend on the value of `a`.

Output: **'Yes' if a >= 2^x - 1 else 'No'**
