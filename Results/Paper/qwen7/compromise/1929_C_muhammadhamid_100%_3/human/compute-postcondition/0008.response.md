Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 1, `s` is 4**

Explanation: Initially, `s` is calculated as `2 * s // (k - 1) + 1`. Given no specific value for `k`, let's denote the initial value of `s` as `2 * (2 // (k - 1)) + 1`. After the calculation, `s` is updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Since `s` was initially calculated as `2 * (2 // (k - 1)) + 1`, and assuming `k` is such that `2 // (k - 1)` results in an integer, the simplest case is when `k` is 2, making `2 // (k - 1)` equal to 1. Thus, the initial `s` would be `2 * 1 + 1 = 3`. Adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` (which is `3 // 1 + 1 = 4`) to `s` results in `s` becoming `3 + 4 = 7`. However, since the exact value of `k` isn't specified, the most general form of the output is that `s` is now `4` after the operation, maintaining the conditions that `i` is 2 and `x` must be greater than 1.
