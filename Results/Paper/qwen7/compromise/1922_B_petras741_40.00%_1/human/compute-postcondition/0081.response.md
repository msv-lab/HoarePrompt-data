Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is equal to `n-1`, and each element in the list `q` at index `w[j]` for `j` ranging from `0` to `n-1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in the list `w`.

This means that `q` will contain the count of how many times each integer from the list `w` appears, up to the length of `w`.
