Output State: **`res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * 2 + q[eta[j]]`, `j` is increased by 1 and is now `j + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `rho += q[eta[j]]` adds the value of `q[eta[j]]` to the current value of `rho`. Given the initial state, `rho` was already increased by `q[eta[j]] * 2` before this line of code. Therefore, the new value of `rho` is the sum of its previous value (`q[eta[j]] * 2`) and the current value of `q[eta[j]]`, which simplifies to `q[eta[j]] * 2 + q[eta[j]]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
