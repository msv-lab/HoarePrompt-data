Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j` and `n`**:
   - The initial state given is that `eta` is an empty list.
   - It is also mentioned that `j` will be `n-1` at the start of the loop.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j < n + 1`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `n` must be at least 1 (since `j` will go up to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0, so the loop can start.
   - We also need to set `j` to `n-1` as specified.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `j`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`eta` is an empty list, `j` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
