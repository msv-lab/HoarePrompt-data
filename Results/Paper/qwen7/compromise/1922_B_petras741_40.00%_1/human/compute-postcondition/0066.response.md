Postcondition: **`rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `t` must be at least 1, `n` is equal to the initial value after the loop, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `q` is a list containing `n + 1` zeros except for the index `w[0]` which is now `n`, `j` is equal to `eta_ln` (which is 1), `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` where `q[j]` was greater than 0 during the loop's iterations, and either the length of `eta` is 1 and `rho` is set to `q[eta[0]]`, or the loop has completed all iterations (or stopped due to `j > 1000`) with `res` being the sum of all increments, `rho` being the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` values, and `j` being equal to `eta_ln`.**
