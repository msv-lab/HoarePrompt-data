State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `q` is a list containing `n + 1` zeros, `j` is 0**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine Initial Values for Loop Variables**:
   - `j` is the loop variable, and it starts at 0 (as per the `range(n)` function).
   - `n` is already given as an input integer with a value of at least 3.
3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 3, as specified.
   - `j` must start at 0 to begin the loop.

The other variables (`t`, `w`, and `q`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start. They remain as they are given in the initial state.
