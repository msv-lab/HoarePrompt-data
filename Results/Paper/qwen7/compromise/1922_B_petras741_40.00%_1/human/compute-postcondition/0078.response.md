Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `w[j]` is incremented by 1 in the list `q`.**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. Given that `j` is 1, it means `w[j]` refers to the first element in the list `w`. Since `w[j]` is incremented by 1 in the dictionary `q`, the output state reflects this change. The conditions for `n` and the value of `j` remain unchanged.
