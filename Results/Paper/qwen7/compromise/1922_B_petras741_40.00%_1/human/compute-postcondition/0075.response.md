Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts (this is the default behavior of `range(n)`).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop runs from `j = 0` to `j < n`.
   - `j` starts at 0 and will increment in each iteration, but its initial value is not directly relevant to the loop condition.

4. **Consider the given state before the loop**:
   - `t` is at least 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `w` is a list of integers converted from the input string.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `q` is a list of `n+1` zeros.

5. **Adjust the states to ensure the loop can execute**:
   - Since the loop depends on `n`, `n` must be at least 1.
   - The values of `t`, `w`, `i`, and `q` do not affect the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n` being at least 1, and `j` starting at 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be at least 1, `j` is 0**
