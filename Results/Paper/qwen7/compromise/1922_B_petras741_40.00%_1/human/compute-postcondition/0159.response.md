Output State: **`eta` is a list containing `n`, `j` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` (which is `n`) to the list `eta`. Since `eta` was initially an empty list, after appending `j`, `eta` now contains the single element `n`. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
