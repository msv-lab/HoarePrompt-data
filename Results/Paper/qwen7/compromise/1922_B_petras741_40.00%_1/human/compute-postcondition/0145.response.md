Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1.
   - `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `q[w[j]]` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration (where `j` is 2).

Given these points, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`j` is 2, `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1**
