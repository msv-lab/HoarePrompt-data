Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `t` must be at least 1, `n` is equal to the initial value after the loop, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `q` is a list containing `n + 1` zeros except for the index `w[0]` which is now `n`, `j` is equal to -1, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` where `q[j]` was greater than 0 during the loop's iterations, and `eta_ln` is not equal to 1; `res` is equal to `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, eta_ln):
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
    rho += q[eta[j]]
    if j > 1000:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and then further increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, and `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`, and the current value of `j` is greater than 1000.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * 2`, and `j` is increased by 1. If `j` is greater than 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * 2 + q[eta[j]]`, `j` is increased by 1 and is now `j + 1`. If `j` is greater than 1000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
