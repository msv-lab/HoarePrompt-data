Output State: **`j` is 2; `n` is defined and greater than 1; `eta` is a list containing 1 and 2.**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` (which is 2) to the list `eta`. Initially, `eta` contains the value 1. After appending 2, `eta` will contain both 1 and 2. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged.
