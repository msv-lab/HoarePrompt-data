Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is `n-1`, `n` is defined and positive, and `eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in ascending order.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The list `eta` will contain all integers from 0 to `n-1` in ascending order, with each integer appearing exactly once. This is because for each iteration of the loop, if `q[j]` is greater than 0, the integer `j` is appended to the list `eta`. Since `q[j]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in the list `w`, and given the conditions provided, each integer from 0 to `n-1` will be appended to `eta` exactly once.
