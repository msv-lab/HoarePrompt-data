Output State: **`res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * 2`, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` must be less than `eta_ln`.**

Explanation: The code `rho += q[eta[j]]` increments the value of `rho` by `q[eta[j]]`. Since `rho` was already increased by `q[eta[j]]` before this line, the total increase in `rho` is now `q[eta[j]] * 2`. The other variables (`res`, `j`, and `eta_ln`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
