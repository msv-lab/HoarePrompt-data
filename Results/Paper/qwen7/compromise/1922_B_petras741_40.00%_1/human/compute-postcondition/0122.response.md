Output State: **`j` is 4, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1, `res` is increased by `q[eta[4]] * (q[eta[4]] - 1) * (q[eta[4]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[4]] * (q[eta[4]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `2 * q[eta[2]] + 2 * q[eta[3]]`, `rho` is further increased by `q[eta[4]]`**

Explanation:
- Initially, `j` is 4.
- `eta_ln` must be greater than 1.
- `res` is increased by `q[eta[4]] * (q[eta[4]] - 1) * (q[eta[4]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[4]] * (q[eta[4]] - 1) // 2 * rho`.
- `rho` is increased by `q[eta[2]] + q[eta[3]] + q[eta[3]]`, which simplifies to `2 * q[eta[2]] + 2 * q[eta[3]]`.

The code then increments `rho` by `q[eta[j]]`, which is `q[eta[4]]`. So, `rho` is further increased by `q[eta[4]]`.
