Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the condition `range(n)`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `w[j]` is incremented by 1 in the list `q`.

3. **Determine the Next Values**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must be at least 1. Since no information suggests `n` changes within the loop, `n` remains at least 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `n` remains at least 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`n` must be at least 1, `j` is 2**
