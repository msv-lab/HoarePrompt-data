Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(t)` will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
3. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and that `i` starts from 1 (since `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to t-1).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `buffer` is an empty list.

Since the loop depends on `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1. The value of `buffer` does not affect the loop execution, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be at least 1**
