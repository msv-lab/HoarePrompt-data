Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The main issue lies in the logic used to count valid combinations of sticks. Specifically, the program does not check if the chosen sticks satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
1 2 2 3
```

The program will output `12`, but the correct output should be `4` because the valid combinations are:
- (1, 2, 2)
- (1, 2, 3)
- (2, 2, 3)

However, the program counts all possible combinations of three sticks without checking the triangle inequality, leading to incorrect results.
