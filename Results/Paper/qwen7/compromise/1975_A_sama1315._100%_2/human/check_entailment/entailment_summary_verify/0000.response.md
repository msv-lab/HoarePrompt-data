### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. This means we need to check if there exists an index `i` such that:
1. The subarray `a[0:i]` is non-decreasing.
2. The subarray `a[i:n]` is non-decreasing.
3. The last element of the first part (`a[i-1]`) is less than or equal to the first element of the second part (`a[i]`).

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
   - This function checks if the array `a` can be made non-decreasing by finding a subarray in the concatenated array `a + a` that matches the sorted version of `a`.
   - This approach is fundamentally flawed because it does not check the conditions mentioned above. It simply checks if the sorted array is a subarray of the concatenated array, which is not relevant to the problem.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1(a)` for each test case.
   - The function collects results and prints them.

#### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve iterating through the array and checking the conditions mentioned in the problem statement. Here's a possible implementation:

```python
def can_be_non_decreasing(a):
    n = len(a)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i-1] > a[i]:
            return False
    return True

def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i-1] <= a[i]:
            continue
        else:
            # Check if the array can be split at index i
            if can_be_non_decreasing(a[:i]) and can_be_non_decreasing(a[i:]):
                return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        result = func_1(a)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))
```
