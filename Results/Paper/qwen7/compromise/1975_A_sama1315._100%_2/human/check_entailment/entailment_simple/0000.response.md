### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - The given solution uses a different approach by checking if the array can be split and rearranged to match a sorted version of itself within a concatenated version of the array.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the array `a` can be rearranged to be non-decreasing by comparing subsequences of the concatenated array with the sorted version of `a`.
   - The logic is flawed because:
     - It concatenates the array with itself, which is unnecessary and does not help in determining if a split and swap can make the array non-decreasing.
     - It checks for a subsequence in the concatenated array that matches the sorted version of `a`. However, this does not guarantee that a valid split exists.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The logic here is also flawed because:
     - It reads input and processes it correctly, but the processing logic in `func_1` is incorrect.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - A correct approach would involve checking if there exists a point in the array where the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing.
   - One possible correct method is to find the longest non-decreasing subarray starting from the beginning and check if the remaining part can be appended to form a non-decreasing sequence.

### Conclusion:

Given the flawed logic in both functions, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Response:

Correctness: **False**
