The function accepts a list of positive integers `a` and checks if, when concatenating the list with itself, any subsequence matches the sorted version of the original list. If such a subsequence is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'. After executing all iterations of the loop, if no matching subsequence is found, the function returns 'No'.
