Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each set of input data, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and for each edge described by `v` and `u`, 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n. The function returns information based on this input data.**

This means the function `func_1` does not take any parameters itself but works with predefined input data constraints. It processes data sets where `t` represents the number of test cases, each test case includes `n` (number of nodes) and `k` (some specific condition related to `n`), and involves edges defined by pairs of nodes `v` and `u`. The function then returns some form of output based on this processed data.
