Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):`. The key variables here are the one used in the loop, which is `_`, and the expression inside `range()`, which is `int(sys.stdin.readline())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as the value of `int(sys.stdin.readline())` is greater than 0. This means that the loop will execute if the user inputs a positive integer.

3. **Determine the initial state**: The initial state given is that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` is already within the valid range for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**: Since the loop condition depends on the value read from `sys.stdin`, we need to ensure that the input read from `sys.stdin` is a positive integer. Given that `t` is within the valid range, we can assume that the first input read from `sys.stdin` will be a positive integer, ensuring the loop executes.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is the value read from `sys.stdin` to ensure the loop executes.

**State:**
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- The value read from `sys.stdin` must be a positive integer (which is guaranteed by the given range of `t`).

However, since the state before the loop starts is already within the valid range, no additional adjustments are necessary.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
