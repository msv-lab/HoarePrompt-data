Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array \(a\) derived from the string \(s\).
2. The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of '-' characters in the string \(s\) and using the formula \(n - 2 \times \text{neg}\), where \(n\) is the length of the string and \(\text{neg}\) is the count of '-' characters.
3. The logic behind the formula \(n - 2 \times \text{neg}\) is to minimize the penalty. By grouping all '-' characters together and all '+' characters together, the penalty is minimized because the penalty of a sequence of '+' characters is zero, and the penalty of a sequence of '-' characters is minimized when they are grouped together.
4. The condition `if n != neg` ensures that if the number of '-' characters is equal to the length of the string, the penalty is simply the length of the string, which is correct because splitting the string into individual '-' characters would result in a penalty of 1 for each character.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
