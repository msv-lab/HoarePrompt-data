Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty for splitting an array derived from a string `s` into non-empty subarrays.
2. The provided program only handles one test case at a time, which is correct since the `while t:` loop iterates through each test case.
3. The function `func_1()` correctly counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.
4. The formula `n - 2 * neg` is used to calculate the result, where `n` is the length of the string and `neg` is the count of '-' characters.
5. The logic checks if `n` equals `neg`. If true, it returns `n`; otherwise, it returns `n - 2 * neg`.

Given the execution summary, the program processes a single test case correctly by counting the '-' characters and applying the formula. However, the provided code does not actually split the array into subarrays or calculate the penalties as described in the problem statement. Instead, it uses a simplified approach to directly compute a value based on the count of '-' characters.

Since the problem's requirements involve splitting the array and calculating penalties, the provided solution does not fully meet the problem's criteria. However, based on the given execution summary and the simplified approach taken, the provided code does handle the simplified part correctly for the given test cases.

Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully implement the problem's requirements but handles a simplified version of the problem correctly for the given test cases.
