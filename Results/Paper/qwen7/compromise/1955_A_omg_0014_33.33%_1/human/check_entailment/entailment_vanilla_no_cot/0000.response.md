Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the promotion. The logic in the program incorrectly compares `a * b` (the cost without promotion) with `a * d` (which is `c / 2`), which is not meaningful in this context. Instead, the program should consider how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price and how many individual yogurts need to be bought at the regular price.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of pairs that can be bought at the promotion price
        pairs = n // 2
        # Calculate the remaining individual yogurts
        singles = n % 2
        # Calculate the total cost
        total_cost = pairs * b + singles * a
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

This corrected program will properly calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given promotion conditions.
