You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates either \( a \times b \) or \( a \times \frac{c}{2} \) (where \( c \) is another integer read from input), and prints the result. The function does not return any value but prints the calculated values for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the price of one yogurt, the price of two yogurts, and the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, respectively.

2. **Calculating the Cost:**
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is the price of one yogurt under the promotion.
   - It then compares `a * b` (the cost without promotion) with `a * d` (the cost with promotion).
   - If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, it prints `a * b`. Otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `d`:**
   - The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which is not correct. The correct calculation should be `d = b / 2` because `b` is the price for two yogurts.

2. **Comparison Logic:**
   - The logic to decide whether to use the promotion or not is flawed. The comparison should be between the total cost of buying all yogurts individually (`a * n`) and the total cost using the promotion (`b * ceil(n / 2)`).

3. **Rounding Issue:**
   - The use of `round(a * d)` might not always give the minimum cost. For example, if `n` is odd, the correct approach would be to buy `n // 2` pairs at the promotion price and the remaining one at the individual price.

### Corrected Program:

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (n_yogurts, price_per_yogurt, price_for_two) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying all yogurts individually
        cost_individual = n_yogurts * price_per_yogurt
        # Calculate the cost of buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price
        pairs = n_yogurts // 2
        remaining = n_yogurts % 2
        cost_promotion = pairs * (price_for_two) + remaining * price_per_yogurt
        # Print the minimum cost
        print(min(cost_individual, cost_promotion))

# Example usage:
func()
```

Given the issues in the original program, the provided solution is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is:
