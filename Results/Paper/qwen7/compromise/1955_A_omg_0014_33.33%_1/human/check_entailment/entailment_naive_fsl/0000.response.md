Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts. Specifically, the program calculates `d` as `c / 2` and then compares `a * b` with `a * d`, which is incorrect. The correct approach would be to compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`) with the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (`b * (n // 2)`) and the remaining single yogurts at the regular price (`a * (n % 2)`).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the minimum cost
        pairs = c if c < 2 * a else 2 * a
        total_cost = (c if c < 2 * a else 2 * a) * (c // 2) + a * (n % 2)
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

This corrected function ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly by considering both the regular and promotional prices.
