Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `day` is initialized to `'AM'`.
   - `n` is read from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, the program reads a time in the format `hh:mm` and splits it into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
   
3. **Convert 24-Hour Time to 12-Hour Time**:
   - If `h` is 0, it is set to 12 and `day` remains `'AM'`. This handles the case where the hour is midnight.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to `'PM'`. This correctly converts the hour to the 12-hour format for afternoon and evening times.
   - Otherwise, `day` is set to `'AM'`. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to `'PM'`. This handles the transition from 12 AM to 12 PM correctly.
   
4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the time in the 12-hour format followed by the appropriate AM/PM indicator.

### Issues Identified

1. **Handling Midnight and Noon**:
   - The logic for handling midnight (00:00) and noon (12:00) is slightly off. Specifically, when `h` is 0, it should be treated as 12 AM, but the program incorrectly sets `day` to `'AM'` without considering the minute part.
   - When `h` is 12, it should be treated as 12 PM, but the program incorrectly sets `day` to `'PM'` without considering the minute part.

2. **Minute Handling**:
   - The minutes are not being printed correctly. The program should ensure that both hours and minutes are formatted with leading zeros if necessary.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h -= 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        
        # Ensure both hours and minutes have leading zeros
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

### Conclusion

The original program has issues with handling midnight and noon correctly and does not ensure that both hours and minutes are formatted with leading zeros. Therefore, the original program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
