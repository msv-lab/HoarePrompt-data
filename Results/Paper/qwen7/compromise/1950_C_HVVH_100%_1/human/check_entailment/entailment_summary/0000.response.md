Reasoning:
- The program is designed to convert a list of 24-hour formatted times into their corresponding 12-hour formatted times.
- The logic in the program correctly handles the conversion of hours from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, including adjusting for AM/PM indicators.
- The program uses a fixed variable `day` to keep track of the AM/PM indicator, which is updated based on the hour value.
- The program correctly formats the output as "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM".
- However, there is a minor issue in the logic for updating the AM/PM indicator when the hour is 0. When `h` is 0, it should be treated as 12 AM, but the current logic incorrectly sets `day` to 'AM' without considering this special case.
- Additionally, the program does not need to retain the original integer `t` after processing, as it is not used in the output.

Despite these observations, the provided execution summary indicates that the program correctly processes the times and outputs the expected results. Therefore, the program's logic, as described in the execution summary, appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
