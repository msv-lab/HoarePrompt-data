Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the last time conversion in the loop, `n` is the number of times the loop has executed.

After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The `day` variable will reflect the time of the last converted time within the loop, and `n` will be equal to the number of times the loop has run, which is provided as input.
