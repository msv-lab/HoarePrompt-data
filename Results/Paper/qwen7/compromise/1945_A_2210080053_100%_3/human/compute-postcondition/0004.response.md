Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes three non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. For each test case, it updates the number of extroverts by adding the number of universals and then calculates and prints the number of valid seating arrangements based on the adjusted number of extroverts and introverts. After processing all test cases, it outputs the calculated values for each case.**
