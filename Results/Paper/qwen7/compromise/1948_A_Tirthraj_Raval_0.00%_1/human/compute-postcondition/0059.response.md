Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, but these integers are not directly passed to the function. Instead, the function is expected to handle these values internally based on the given constraints. The function returns a value based on the relationship between `t` and `n`.**

However, since the function signature does not include parameters `t` and `n`, and the problem statement suggests these are internal values, the function's actual behavior cannot be fully described without more context. Based on the given format and constraints, the function is expected to process these values and return a result, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified.
