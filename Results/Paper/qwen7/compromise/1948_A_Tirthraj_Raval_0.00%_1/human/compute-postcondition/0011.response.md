Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n // 2):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `pattern` is a list containing 'AB'.
   - The value of `n` is not explicitly given, but it is required for the loop condition.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i < n // 2`.

4. **Calculate the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2 (the next integer).
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n // 2`.
   - Since `i` is now 2, `n // 2` must be greater than 2, meaning `n` must be greater than 4.

6. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.

7. **Final State:**
   - The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 4**
