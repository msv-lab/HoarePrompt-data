Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n // 2):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 5
   - `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B'
   - `n` must be greater than 8

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n // 2`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is 5.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 6.

5. **Determine the new value of `n`**:
   - Since `i` is now 6, for the loop to continue, `n // 2` must be greater than 6.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 12 (since `12 // 2 = 6`).

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` is now 6.
   - `n` must be greater than 12.
   - The state of `pattern` does not change because it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 6, `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B', `n` must be greater than 12**
