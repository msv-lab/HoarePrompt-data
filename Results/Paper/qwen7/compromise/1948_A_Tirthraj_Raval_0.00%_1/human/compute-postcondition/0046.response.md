Output State: **`i` is 4; `pattern` contains 'AB'[3] which is 'B'**

Explanation: The code updates the `pattern` list by appending the value from the string `'AB'` based on the condition `i % 2 ^ 1`. Given that `i` is 4, `i % 2` is 0, and `0 ^ 1` is 1. So, `'AB'[1]` is 'B', which is already in the `pattern` list. Therefore, the `pattern` remains unchanged, and still contains 'B'.
