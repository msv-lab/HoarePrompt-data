Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and either `n` is an odd number, in which case `t` remains unchanged and `n` is decremented by 1, or `n` is even, in which case `i` equals `n // 2` and `pattern` is a list containing alternating 'A' and 'B' characters with a length of `n // 2`.**
