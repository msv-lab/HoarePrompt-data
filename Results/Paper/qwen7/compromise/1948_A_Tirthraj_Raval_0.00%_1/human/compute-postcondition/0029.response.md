Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n // 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not change).
   - `n` must be at least 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not change).
   - `pattern` is `['A', 'B']` (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not change).
   - `i` is 2.

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n // 2`.
   - Given `i` is currently 2, `n // 2` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.
   - `n` must be at least 5 (since `n // 2` must be greater than 2).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 5, `pattern` is `['A', 'B']`, `i` is 3**
