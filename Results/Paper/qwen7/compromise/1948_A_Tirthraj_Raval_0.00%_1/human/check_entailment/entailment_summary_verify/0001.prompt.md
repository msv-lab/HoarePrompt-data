You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases (up to 50) where for each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) (between 1 and 50). If \( n \) is odd, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and generates a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters of length \( n/2 \), then prints this string. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.

2. **Checking for Validity:**
   - It checks if `n` is odd.
     - If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because an odd number of special characters cannot be achieved with the given rules.
     - If `n` is even, it proceeds to generate a string.

3. **Generating the String:**
   - It initializes an empty list `pattern`.
   - It generates a pattern using 'A' and 'B' such that each pair of adjacent characters is different.
   - Specifically, it alternates between 'A' and 'B' for the first half of the pattern and repeats this for the second half.
   - Finally, it joins the list into a string and prints it.

4. **Special Character Check:**
   - Each character in the generated string will have exactly one neighbor that is different from it.
   - This ensures that every character in the string is special.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1 (`n = 6`):**
  - The program will generate a string like "ABABAB" or "BAABBA".
  - In both cases, each character has exactly one different neighbor, making all characters special.
  - The output will be:
    ```
    YES
    ABABAB
    ```

- **Test Case 2 (`n = 1`):**
  - Since `n` is odd, the program will print 'NO'.
  - Output:
    ```
    NO
    ```

- **Test Case 3 (`n = 2`):**
  - The program will generate a string like "AB" or "BA".
  - Both strings have exactly one special character.
  - The output will be:
    ```
    YES
    AB
    ```

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all cases where `n` is even by generating a suitable string and correctly reports when `n` is odd. The generated strings meet the criteria of having exactly one special character per position.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
