Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:

1. The program initializes `soma` outside of the outer loop and adds values to `soma` using `func_1(i)` inside the loop. However, `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`, which means it does not iterate through all the numbers from 1 to `n`.

2. The function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of the digits of a number `n`, but this function is called incorrectly. It should be used to calculate the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `n`, not for the numbers 0 to `n-1`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)

def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
```

In this corrected version:
- `t` is read first to handle multiple test cases.
- For each test case, `soma` is reset to 0 before starting the inner loop.
- The inner loop iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive), correctly calculating the sum of the digits for each number in this range.
