Reasoning:
1. The given program does not match the problem description. The problem requires processing multiple test cases, but the provided code seems to handle only one test case.
2. The program initializes `soma` to 0 and reads `N`, which should be the number of test cases, but it then processes only one value of `n` without considering the multiple test cases.
3. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a number, which is part of the solution but is not used correctly in the main logic of the program.
4. The program should iterate over the test cases and for each test case, compute the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to `n`.

Given these points, the provided program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
