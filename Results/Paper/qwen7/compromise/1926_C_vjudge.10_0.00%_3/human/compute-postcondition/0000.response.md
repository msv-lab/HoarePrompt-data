Output State: **The program returns the sum of the digits of the integer n.**

Given that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to \(2 \times 10^5\), the code converts `n` into a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string representation of `n`, converts each character back to an integer, and sums these integers. The result of this summation is then returned by the program.
