Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and two positive integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and the sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. It returns an error message if `t` (which is not explicitly defined but implied to be the length of the list `a`) is not within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Otherwise, it processes the list `a` and the integers `n` and `k` according to the problem's requirements.**
