Output State: **`ans` is `ans` modulo `MOD`, `t` is `t % MOD`, `i` is `i_end + 2`, and `k` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code `ans %= MOD` updates `ans` to be its value modulo `MOD`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, or `k`. Therefore, `t` remains `t % MOD`, `i` remains `i_end + 2`, and `k` remains the same as before.
