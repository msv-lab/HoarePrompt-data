Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the first element in the list `a`, `tmp` is equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The code `tmp += x` increments the value of `tmp` by the value of `x`. Since `x` is the first element in the list `a`, `tmp` is now equal to `x`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
