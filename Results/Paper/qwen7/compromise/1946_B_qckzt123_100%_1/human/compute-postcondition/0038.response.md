Output State: **`ans` is `ans` modulo `MOD`, `t` is `t % MOD`, `i` is `i_end + 2`, and `k` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The line `t %= MOD` updates `t` to be `t % MOD`. This means `t` is now the remainder when `t` is divided by `MOD`. All other variables (`ans`, `i`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
