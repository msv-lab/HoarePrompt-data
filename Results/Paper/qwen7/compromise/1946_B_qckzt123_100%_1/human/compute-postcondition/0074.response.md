Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 1, `t` is 2 % MOD, `ans` is `ans` % MOD**

Explanation: The line `ans %= MOD` updates `ans` to be the remainder of `ans` divided by `MOD`. Since the initial state of `ans` is `ans` + 2 % MOD, we can simplify this to `ans` being the remainder of `(ans + 2) % MOD`. However, since the exact value of `MOD` is not specified, we keep it as `ans` % MOD. The other variables remain unchanged.
