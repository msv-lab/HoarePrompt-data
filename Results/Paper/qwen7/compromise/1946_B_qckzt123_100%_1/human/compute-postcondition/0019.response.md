Output State: **`tmp` is 0 + `x`, `t` is `max(0, t)`, `T` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with one less element, `s` is the sum of all remaining elements in list `a`**.

In this output state, `tmp` is updated by adding `x` to its previous value (which was 0), so `tmp` becomes `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
