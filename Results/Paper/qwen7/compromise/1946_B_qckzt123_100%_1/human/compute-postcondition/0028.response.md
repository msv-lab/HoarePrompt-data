Output State: **`t` is the value of `t` modulo `MOD`.**

Explanation: The code `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be the remainder when `t` is divided by `MOD`. Since the initial state only mentions that `t` is twice its original value, the exact original value of `t` is not specified. However, after executing the code, `t` is updated to its value modulo `MOD`.
