Output State: **`i` is 1; `t` is 4 % MOD; `ans` is 4 % MOD**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `t`. Given that `t` is 4 % MOD, and initially `ans` is 2 % MOD, after executing `ans += t`, `ans` becomes (2 + 4) % MOD, which simplifies to 4 % MOD. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged.
