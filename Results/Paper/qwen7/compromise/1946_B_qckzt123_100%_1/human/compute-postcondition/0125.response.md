Output State: **`i` is 1; `t` is 4 % MOD; `ans` is 4 % MOD**

Explanation: The code `ans %= MOD` updates the value of `ans` by taking the modulus with `MOD`. Since the initial value of `ans` is `4 % MOD`, and no specific value for `MOD` is given, `ans` remains `4 % MOD`. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged.
