Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k - 1`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `k - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `t` is 2 % MOD
   - `ans` is 2 % MOD

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `0 + 1 = 1`.
   - The value of `k - 1` remains unchanged.

5. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `k - 1`. Given that `i` is now 1, the loop will continue if `k - 1` is greater than 1.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` is updated to 1.
   - `k - 1` remains unchanged, but since it is not directly mentioned in the state, we focus on the variables that change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 2 % MOD, `ans` is 2 % MOD**
