Output State: **`ans` is `ans` modulo `MOD`, `t` is `t % MOD`, `i` is `i_end + 1`, and `k` is the same as before.**

The code `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be `t % MOD`. This operation does not change the values of `ans`, `i`, or `k`. Therefore, `ans` remains `ans` modulo `MOD`, `t` becomes `t % MOD`, `i` remains `i_end + 1`, and `k` remains the same as before.
