Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves performing operations on an array to maximize its sum. Each operation allows selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations, with the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Components**:
   - The algorithm first calculates the maximum subarray sum (`t`) using Kadane's algorithm, which discards negative sums.
   - It then calculates the sum of the original array (`s`).
   - The result `ans` is derived by adding `s + t` and then adding the sum of powers of 2 up to \(2^{k-1}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - **Maximum Subarray Sum (`t`)**: The code correctly implements Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum, discarding negative sums.
   - **Sum of Original Array (`s`)**: The sum of the array is calculated correctly.
   - **Power of 2 Calculation**: The code correctly calculates the sum of powers of 2 up to \(2^{k-1}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using a loop.
   - **Modulo Operation**: All operations involving modulo \(10^9 + 7\) are handled correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles negative sums correctly by setting `tmp` to 0 when it becomes negative.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result stays within the required bounds.

5. **Output**: The final result is printed correctly for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
