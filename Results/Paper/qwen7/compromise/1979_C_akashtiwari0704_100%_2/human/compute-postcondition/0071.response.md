Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all valid indices `i` from 0 to `bets-1`.
   - `bets` is the initial value it was set to.
   - `i` is equal to `bets`.
   - `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]` for all valid indices `i` from 0 to `bets-1`.
   - `ans` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in the list `a`, separated by spaces.
   - `T` is `T + len(l) - 1`.
   - The condition `sumo >= prod` holds true.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

Given the code snippet, the `print` statement simply outputs `-1`. The values of the other variables (`sumo`, `bets`, `i`, `a`, `ans`, `T`) are not needed to determine what is printed by this specific line of code.

Therefore, the output is straightforward:

Output: **-1**
