Based on the initial state provided:

- `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1`.
- `i` is `len(a) + 3*bets - 3`.
- `bets` must be greater than or equal to `len(a) + 2*bets - 3`.
- `a` is a list of integers where each element is `prod // a[i]`.
- `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all integers in list `a`.
- `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print(-1)
```

This statement will print the integer `-1` directly.

Output: **-1**
