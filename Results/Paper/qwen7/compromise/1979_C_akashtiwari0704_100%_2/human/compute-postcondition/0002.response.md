Output State: **`t` is 0, `g` is 1**

The initial state indicates that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), but the specific value of `t` is given as 0. The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `g`. Since `t` is specifically stated to be 0, this value does not change. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `g` and retains the specific value of `t`.
