Output State: **`bets` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, `t` remains 0, `i` is the length of the list `l` after the function `lcm` executes, and the function `lcm` will compute the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list `l`.**

In this output state, the variable `bets` is updated to the integer value entered by the user through the `input()` function. The variables `t` and `i` retain their previous values, with `t` remaining 0 and `i` being the length of the list `l` after the `lcm` function has executed. The `lcm` function will proceed to calculate the LCM of all elements in the list `l`.
