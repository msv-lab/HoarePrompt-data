Postcondition: **Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `sumo` will be the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1`. The value of `i` will be `len(a) + 3*bets - 3`, `bets` must be greater than or equal to `len(a) + 2*bets - 3`, `a` will be a list of integers where each element is `prod // a[i]`, and `prod` will be the least common multiple (LCM) of all integers in list `a`. Additionally, `sumo` is now greater than or equal to `prod`.**
