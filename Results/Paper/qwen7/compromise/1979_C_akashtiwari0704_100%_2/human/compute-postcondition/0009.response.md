Output State: **`t` is 0, `g` is `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1]) * l[3] // gcd(l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1]) * l[3], l[3])`, `l` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 3**.

Explanation: The variable `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. Given that `i` is 3, `g` is initially `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`, and `l` is a list with at least 2 elements, `g` is now updated to `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1]) * l[3] // gcd(l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1]) * l[3], l[3])`. The other variables remain unchanged.
