Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans` is a string containing `str(a[0])` followed by a space; `bets` is a non-negative integer that satisfies `bets < len(a) + 2*bets - 3`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` increments the index `i` by 1 (so `i` becomes 1), appends the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space to the string `ans`, and does not affect the value of `bets`. Therefore, `i` is updated to 1, `ans` contains the string `str(a[0]) + ' '`, and `bets` remains unchanged with the condition `bets < len(a) + 2*bets - 3` still holding true.
