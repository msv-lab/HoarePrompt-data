Output State: **`bets` is a value entered by the user, `t` remains 0, `i` is the length of the list `a` which is a list of integers entered by the user, and `a` is a list of integers converted from the input.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` by taking a space-separated string of integers as input and converting each element into an integer. The original values of `bets` and `t` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is set to the length of the newly created list `a`. The function `lcm` is mentioned in the initial state but is not called in this code snippet.
