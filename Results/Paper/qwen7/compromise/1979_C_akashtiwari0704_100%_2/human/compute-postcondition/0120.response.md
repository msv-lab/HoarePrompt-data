Output State: **`i` is 5; `ans` is a string containing `str(a[0])` followed by `str(a[1])` and a space, followed by `str(a[5])` and a space; `bets` must be greater than 4.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends `str(a[i])` followed by a space to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 4, so `ans` contains `str(a[0])` followed by `str(a[1])` and a space. After executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1 (becoming 5), and `ans` now contains `str(a[0])` followed by `str(a[1])` and a space, followed by `str(a[5])` and a space. The condition for `bets` remains unchanged.
