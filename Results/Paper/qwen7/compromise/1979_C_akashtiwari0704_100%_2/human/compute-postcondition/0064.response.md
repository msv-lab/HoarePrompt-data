Output State: **`sumo` is `0 + prod // a[i] + int(a[i])`, `bets` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`, `a[i]` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. Given the initial state, `sumo` was initially `0 + prod // a[i]`. After executing the code, `sumo` becomes `0 + prod // a[i] + int(a[i])`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.
