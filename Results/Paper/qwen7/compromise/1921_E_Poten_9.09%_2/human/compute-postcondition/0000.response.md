Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer input from the user within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, and all other variables (`t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`) retain their initial conditions.**

Explanation: The code `test_cases = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `test_cases`. Since the input is guaranteed to be within the specified range (1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4), this is the updated state for `test_cases`. All other variables (`t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions as per the precondition.
