Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Movement Duration:**
   - The logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is flawed. The current implementation uses complex calculations that do not correctly account for the movement and inversion rules.
   - Specifically, the variables `A` and `B` are supposed to store the cumulative distances traveled to the left and right, but they are not being updated correctly to reflect the actual movement of the pinball.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The solution does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the pinball starts at the boundary cells (first or last cell) or when the grid configuration causes the pinball to oscillate between two cells without leaving the grid.

3. **Logic Errors:**
   - The logic for updating the indices and calculating the time taken is overly complicated and does not accurately simulate the pinball's movement.
   - For example, the use of `l` and `r` to track indices and the subsequent calculations are not aligned with the problem requirements.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The output format should list the time taken for each query, but the current implementation does not produce the expected output format.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to simulate the movement of the pinball for each query and calculate the time taken for it to leave the grid. This involves iterating through the grid and updating the position of the pinball based on the direction indicated by the characters in the string. Here is a more straightforward approach to solving the problem:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    result = []

    def simulate_pinball(start):
        position = start
        time = 0
        while 0 <= position < n:
            time += 1
            if s[position] == '<':
                position -= 1
            else:
                position += 1
            s = s[:position] + ('<' if s[position] == '>' else '>') + s[position+1:]
        return time

    for i in range(n):
        result.append(simulate_pinball(i))

    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

This solution simulates the movement of the pinball for each starting position and calculates the time taken for it to leave the grid, ensuring correctness according to the problem statement.
