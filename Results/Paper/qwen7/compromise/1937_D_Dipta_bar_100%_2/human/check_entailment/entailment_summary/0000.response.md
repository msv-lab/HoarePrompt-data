Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. However, upon closer inspection, the logic in the program does not accurately reflect the rules of the problem. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Movement**: The program tries to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using cumulative sums of positions of '<' and '>' characters, but this approach does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball as per the problem statement.
2. **Misinterpretation of Grid Movement**: The program does not properly handle the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball according to the rules provided. For example, it does not correctly account for the direction changes and the stopping condition when the pinball leaves the grid.
3. **Incorrect Output Format**: The program's output format does not match the expected output format. The expected output is a sequence of integers representing the time taken for each pinball to leave the grid, but the program's output seems to be derived from some internal calculations rather than the actual time taken.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
