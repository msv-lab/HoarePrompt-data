Output State: **`c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1]`, and `a, b = map(int, input().split())` has been executed.**

Explanation: The code `s = p[b - 1]` assigns the value of the element at index `b - 1` in the list `p` to the variable `s`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
