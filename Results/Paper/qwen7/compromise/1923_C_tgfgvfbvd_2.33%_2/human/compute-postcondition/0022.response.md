Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is the final cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last element in the list `l` that was processed during the loop, `a` is the first integer from the input split, `b` is the second integer from the input split, `s` is equal to the cumulative sum up to the index `a-2` in the list `p`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is updated to the cumulative sum up to the index `a-2` in the list `p`.
