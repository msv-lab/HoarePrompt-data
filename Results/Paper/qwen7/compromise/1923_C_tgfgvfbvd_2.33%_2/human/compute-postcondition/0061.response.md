Output State: **`c` is the initial value of `c` plus the new value of `x`, `l` must contain at least one fewer element, `p` is a list containing the previous value of `c` and the new value of `c`.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(c)` appends the current value of `c` to the list `p`. Since `p` was previously a list containing the previous value of `c` and the new value of `c`, appending the current value of `c` means `p` now contains the previous value of `c`, the new value of `c`, and the current value of `c`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
