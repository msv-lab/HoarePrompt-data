Postcondition: **`c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` elements in `l` minus the cumulative sum of the first `a-2` elements in `l`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, the value of `s` is adjusted accordingly. If the condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1))` is true, the program executes the if part; otherwise, it executes the else part.**
