Postcondition: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` remains 0, `p` remains an empty list, `m` remains greater than 1, `l` remains a non-empty list, `s` is now equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`, and `m` remains greater than 1.**

Explanation: Since both the if and else parts of the if-else statement result in the same postcondition, the overall postcondition after executing the if-else block remains unchanged from the initial postcondition.
