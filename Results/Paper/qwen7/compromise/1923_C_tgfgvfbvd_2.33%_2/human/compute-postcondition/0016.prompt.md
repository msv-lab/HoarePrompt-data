You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 1:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 2:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is an integer input from the second split, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as there were iterations (in this case, the length of `l` is not specified but must be sufficient for all iterations), `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is the final cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last element in the list `l` that was processed during the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains a positive integer, `n` and `m` remain as they were initially, `l` is the original list of integers, and `p` contains the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`. The variable `c` will hold the total sum of all elements in `l`, and `x` will be the last element of `l` that was processed.
```
for _ in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
