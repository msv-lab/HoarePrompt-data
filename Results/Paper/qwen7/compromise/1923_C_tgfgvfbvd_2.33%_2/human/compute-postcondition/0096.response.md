Output State: `c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are the last input integers provided during the loop's execution, `m` is the final value it took after all iterations, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` with the final adjustments made during each iteration of the loop. The value of `m` will be the total number of iterations the loop executed. After all iterations, if the condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1))` is met, the program will print 'YES' for the last iteration; otherwise, it will print 'NO'.
