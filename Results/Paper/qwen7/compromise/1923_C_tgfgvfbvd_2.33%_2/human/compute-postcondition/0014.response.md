Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is an integer input from the second split, `l` is a list of integers that must contain at least three elements, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in the list `l`, `c` is the value of `c` which is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `x` is the last element in the list `l`.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `p` will contain each cumulative sum of the elements in `l` as it iterates through, and `c` will hold the total sum of all elements in `l`. The variable `x` will be the last element of the list `l` since it gets reassigned in each iteration to the current element being processed.
