You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = []
        
        c = 0
        
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `c` will be the sum of all elements in the list `l`, and `p` will be a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`. The variable `m` will hold the total number of iterations the loop executed. For each query, the variable `s` will be calculated as `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` and checked against the condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1))`. If the condition is met, 'YES' will be printed; otherwise, 'NO'. After processing all queries, the loop will terminate, and the final state of `m` will reflect the total number of queries processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list `c` of n positive integers and handles q queries. For each query, it checks if a given range [l_i, r_i] within the list `c` meets certain conditions and returns the results accordingly.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
