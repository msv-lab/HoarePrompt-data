Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input split, `b` is the second integer from the input split, `m` is -1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is the final cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last element in the list `l` that was processed during the loop, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`**.

Explanation: The code subtracts `p[a - 2]` from `s`. Since `s` was previously equal to `p[b - 1]`, after executing `s -= p[a - 2]`, `s` now equals `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
