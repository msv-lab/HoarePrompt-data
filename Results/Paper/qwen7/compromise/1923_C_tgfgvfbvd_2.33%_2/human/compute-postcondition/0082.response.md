Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `s` is initially set to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
- After executing the if statement, if `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. If `a - 2 < 0`, then `s` remains unchanged.

The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
