Output State: **`c` is the initial value of `c` plus the new value of `x`, `l` must contain at least one fewer element, `p` is a list containing the previous value of `c` and the new value of `c`.**

Explanation: The code `c += x` increments the value of `c` by the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial state of `c` is updated to include the new value of `x`, and `p` is updated to contain both the previous and the new value of `c`.
