Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first integer from the input split, `m` is the second integer from the input split, `l` is updated to a list of integers from the input split, `p` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `x` is the last element in the list `l` that was processed during the loop, `a` and `b` are the integers from the next input split, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    c += x
    p.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `c` is the initial value of `c` plus `x`, `l` contains at least one element, and `p` is a list containing the value of `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `c` is the initial value of `c` plus twice the previous value of `x`, `l` must contain at least one fewer element, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` from the previous iteration and now also contains the current value of `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `c` is the initial value of `c` plus the new value of `x`, `l` must contain at least one fewer element, `p` is a list containing the previous value of `c` and the new value of `c`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
