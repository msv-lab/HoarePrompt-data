Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `c` will be the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum up to that point in the list `l`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `c` will hold the sum of all integers in the list `l`. The list `p` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, meaning each element in `p` represents the sum of all elements in `l` up to that point in the iteration.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    s = p[b - 1]
    if a - 2 >= 0:
        s -= p[a - 2]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `c` is 0, `p` is an empty list, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a non-empty list, `s` is an element at index `a - 2` in list `p` and has been decreased by `p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`, `a` is an input integer with the current value such that `a - 2 < 0` or `s < 2 * (b - a + 1)`, and the condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1))` is either true or false.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` remains 0, `p` remains an empty list, `m` remains greater than 1, `l` remains a non-empty list, `s` is now equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`, and `m` remains greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` remains 0, `p` remains an empty list, `m` is greater than 0, `l` remains a non-empty list, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`, `a` and `b` are updated to the integers inputted by the user.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
