Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is an integer input from the second split.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `m`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was a positive integer in the initial state.
