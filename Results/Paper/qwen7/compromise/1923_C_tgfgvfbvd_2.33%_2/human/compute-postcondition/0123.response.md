Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is 0.
- `p` is an empty list.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `l` is a non-empty list.
- `s` is the element at index `a - 2` in list `p` and has been decreased by `p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`.
- `a` is an input integer with the current value such that `a - 2 >= 0`.
- `b` is an input integer.
- The condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1))` is true.

The print statement is `print('YES')`.

Given that the print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'` without any variables or expressions being evaluated, the output will simply be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
