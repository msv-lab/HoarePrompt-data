Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is iterating over the list `l` using the variable `x`. Therefore, the only variables in the loop head are `x` and `l`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `n` is an integer input from the first split.
   - `m` is an integer input from the second split.
   - `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `p` is a list containing the value of `c` plus the first element in the list `l`.
   - `c` is the value of `c` plus the first element in the list `l`.
   - `x` is the second element in the list `l`.
   - `p` has appended the value of `c`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: For the loop to execute again, `x` must be the third element in the list `l` (since it has already iterated over the first and second elements).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `l` should now contain at least three elements because the loop will execute again if there are at least three elements.
   - `p` should have the value of `c` plus the first element of `l` and then appended with the value of `c` again.
   - `c` should be the value of `c` plus the first element of `l` (as given).
   - `x` should be the third element in the list `l`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is an integer input from the second split, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` plus the first element in the list `l` and then appended with the value of `c`, `c` is the value of `c` plus the first element in the list `l`, `x` is the third element in the list `l`**
