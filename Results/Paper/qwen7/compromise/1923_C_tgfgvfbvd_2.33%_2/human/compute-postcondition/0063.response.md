Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `_` and `m`. Since the variable `_` is a placeholder (often used when the index variable is not needed), we focus on `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `m`**: The value of `m` determines whether the loop will execute. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

3. **Check the given state**: The initial state is that `c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, and `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the condition that `m` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `m` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`, `m` must be greater than 0**
