Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into multiple integers using `split()`, and then converts each of those integers to an integer type using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
