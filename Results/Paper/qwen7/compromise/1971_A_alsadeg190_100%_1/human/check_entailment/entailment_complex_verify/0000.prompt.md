You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program: 
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of pairs of integers printed based on the comparison of the two numbers provided in each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each line of input containing two integers \(x\) and \(y\), if \(x < y\), then \(x\) and \(y\) are printed in the order \(x, y\); otherwise, they are printed in the order \(y, x\). The total number of such pairs will be equal to the value of `x`, which is the number of iterations the loop will run.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple pairs of integers \(x\) and \(y\) from the user, compares them, and prints the pair in ascending order. Specifically, for each pair, if \(x < y\), it prints \(x, y\); otherwise, it prints \(y, x\). The function does not return any value; its purpose is to process and output the sorted pairs based on the given conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. The function `func()` reads the number of test cases but only processes one test case inside the loop. It should process each test case separately within the loop. Here is an example where the program fails:

For the input:
```
2
1 9
8 4
```

The expected output is:
```
1 9
4 8
```

However, the program will produce:
```
1 9
8 4
```

This happens because the program only processes the last test case in the loop. To fix this, the program should read and process each test case individually within the loop. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
```

With this correction, the program will correctly handle multiple test cases.
