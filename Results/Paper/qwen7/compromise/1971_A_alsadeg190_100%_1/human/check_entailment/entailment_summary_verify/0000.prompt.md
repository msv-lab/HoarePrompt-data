You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple pairs of integers \(x\) and \(y\) from the user, compares them, and prints the pair in ascending order. Specifically, for each pair, if \(x < y\), it prints \(x, y\); otherwise, it prints \(y, x\). The function does not return any value; its purpose is to process and output the sorted pairs based on the given conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. The function `func()` reads the number of test cases but only processes one test case inside the loop. It should process each test case separately within the loop. Here is an example where the program fails:

For the input:
```
2
1 9
8 4
```

The expected output is:
```
1 9
4 8
```

However, the program will produce:
```
1 9
8 4
```

This happens because the program only processes the last test case in the loop. To fix this, the program should read and process each test case individually within the loop. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
```

With this correction, the program will correctly handle multiple test cases.
