The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the standard input, where \( 2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( k \) is even. It then constructs a list `permutation` of length \( n \) and fills it according to a specific pattern. Specifically, for each iteration from \( 0 \) to \( k-1 \), it places values starting from \( 1 \) up to \( n \) in the list at positions that are multiples of \( k \) plus the current iteration index. After completing these iterations, it prints the contents of the `permutation` list as a space-separated string. The function does not return any value.
