Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 1 + 1`, `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 2`, and `i` is less than `len(permutation)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` to `curr_v`. Given that `curr_v` is defined as `length of permutation + (i + 2)`, the new value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` becomes `length of permutation + (i + 2) + 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
