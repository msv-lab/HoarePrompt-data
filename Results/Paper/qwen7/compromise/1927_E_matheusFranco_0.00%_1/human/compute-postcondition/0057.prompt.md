You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1
    for i in range(k):
        multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
        
        while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `k * (n // k) * k`, which simplifies to `n * k`, since `n` is the total number of iterations and `k` is the step size. `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` will be `curr_v + (n // k)`, where `n // k` is the total number of iterations divided by `k`. The variable `i` will retain its initial value of `0`, and `curr_v` will be equal to `n`, the total number of iterations.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `n * k`, which is the product of the total number of iterations and the step size `k`. The value stored in the `permutation` list at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `curr_v` plus the total number of iterations divided by `k`. The variable `i` will still be `0`, and `curr_v` will be equal to the total number of iterations `n`.
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)
    #This is printed: n + (n // k) [followed by the rest of the elements in the permutation list from index n * k to the end]
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns None since the parameters n and k are not passed as arguments within the function definition.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
