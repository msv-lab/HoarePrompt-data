Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + k`
   - `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 1`
   - `i` is less than `len(permutation)`

3. **Determine what needs to change for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.
   - Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is currently `i + k`, we need to ensure that `i + k < len(permutation)`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is already less than `len(permutation)`, we don't need to change this condition.
   - We need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` remains within the bounds of the permutation list.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `multiples_of_k_plus_i` such that it is still less than `len(permutation)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`**
