Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + n`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. This means that the previous value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` (which was `i + nk`) is no longer relevant. The value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` remains unchanged and is still `curr_v + n`. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`. All other variables remain in their initial state as no changes were made to them.
