Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v`, `i` is less than `len(permutation)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` to `curr_v`. This means that the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` changes from `curr_v + n` to `curr_v`. The other variables remain unchanged, so `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is still `i` and `i` is still less than `len(permutation)`.
