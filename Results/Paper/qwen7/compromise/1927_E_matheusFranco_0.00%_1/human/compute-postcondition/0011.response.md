Output State: `t` is less than or equal to 0.

This means that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` will be less than or equal to 0. This is because the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration and continues as long as `t` is greater than 0. Once `t` becomes 0 or less, the condition `t > 0` in the loop head will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate.
