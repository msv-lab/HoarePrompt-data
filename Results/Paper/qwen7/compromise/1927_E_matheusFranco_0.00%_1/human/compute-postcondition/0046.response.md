Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + 2k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`.
   - `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v`.
   - `curr_v` is `curr_v + 1`.

3. **Determine What Needs Adjustment**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.

Given the current state, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is already set to `i + 2k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must remain less than `len(permutation)`.

Since no other variables in the loop head directly affect the loop condition, the only state that needs adjustment is `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must remain less than `len(permutation)`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + 2k` and must be less than `len(permutation)` and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v`, `curr_v` is `curr_v + 1`**
