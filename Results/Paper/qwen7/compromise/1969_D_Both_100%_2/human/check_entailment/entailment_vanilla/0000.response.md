Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by lists of `a_i` and `b_i`.

2. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A min-heap (`heap`) is initialized to store items that have negative combined values.
   - A list (`remaining_items`) is used to store items that haven't been processed yet.

3. **Processing Items:**
   - Convert `a_i` to negative values (`neg_prices`) to facilitate the use of a min-heap.
   - Combine `neg_prices` and `b_i` into pairs and sort them by `b_i`.
   - Push the first `k` items with the highest `b_i` values into the heap.
   - If there are more items, process the remaining items to calculate the maximum possible profit.

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Use the function `func_3` to calculate the profit for the remaining items.
   - Adjust the current profit by removing items from the heap and adding new items to it.
   - Update the maximum profit if the current profit is higher.

5. **Output:**
   - Print the maximum profit for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Function `func_3`
- This function calculates the total profit from a list of items and a heap.
- It sums up the values of items in the heap and adjusts the profit based on the items' values.
- The logic seems correct but might need optimization for large inputs.

#### Main Logic
- The main logic correctly handles the sorting and heap operations.
- It ensures that the items with the highest `b_i` values are considered first, which aligns with the problem's requirement.
- The use of a heap to manage items that can be taken for free is appropriate.

### Edge Cases and Constraints
- The program handles multiple test cases efficiently.
- The constraints on `n` and `k` are respected.
- The program correctly processes the items and calculates the profit.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to find Alice's optimal profit given the constraints and rules of the game.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
