Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(test_cases)` part. This means the loop will iterate as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `combined` will be empty.
   - `heap` will contain the `k` smallest elements from the original `combined` list.
   - `k` will be 0.
   - `current_profit` is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)`.
   - `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`.
   - `test_cases` will be decremented by 1.
   - `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `prices`, `bonuses`, and `n` will remain unchanged from their initial states.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop will continue as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0, we need to decrement `test_cases` by 1.
   - All other variables (`combined`, `heap`, `k`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `prices`, `bonuses`, `n`) will remain in their current states unless explicitly changed within the loop body, but since no such changes are mentioned, they stay the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `test_cases` will be decremented by 1.
- All other variables will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`combined` is empty, `heap` contains the `k` smallest elements from the original `combined` list, `k` is 0, `current_profit` is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, and `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `prices`, `bonuses`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
