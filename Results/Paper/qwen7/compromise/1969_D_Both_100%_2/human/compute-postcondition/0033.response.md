Output State: **`combined` is now one item shorter, `heap` contains the `k` smallest elements from the original `combined` list excluding the last popped item, `k` remains 0, `current_profit` is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, and all other variables (`test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `prices`, `bonuses`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.**

This means that the last item from the `combined` list has been removed using the `pop()` method, reducing its length by one. The `heap` still contains the `k` smallest elements from the original `combined` list, excluding the last popped item, since `k` remains 0 and no changes were made to the `heap` itself. The `current_profit` and `max_profit` are recalculated with the updated `combined` list, and all other variables retain their initial states.
