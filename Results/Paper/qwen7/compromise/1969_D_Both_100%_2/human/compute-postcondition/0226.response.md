Postcondition: `heap` now contains all items except the one that was replaced by `item`, `removed_item` is the item that was heappushed and heappopped from the heap, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting the first element of `removed_item` and then possibly decreasing by `item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, or simply adjusting by the first element of `item` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, `item` is the last element popped from `combined`, `combined` remains `True`.
