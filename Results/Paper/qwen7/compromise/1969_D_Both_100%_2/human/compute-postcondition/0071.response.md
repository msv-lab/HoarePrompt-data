Output State: **`combined` has at least one item less than before, `current_profit` is reduced by the first element of the last item of the original `combined` list, `item` is now the last element of the original `combined` list, `heap` contains the `item` that was heappushed and heappopped, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, and `current_profit` is reduced by the first element of the last item of the original `combined` list.**

Explanation: The code `max_profit = current_profit` simply assigns the current value of `current_profit` to `max_profit`. Since `current_profit` is reduced by the first element of the last item of the original `combined` list, `max_profit` will also reflect this reduction. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
