Output State: **`heap` has had its second smallest element replaced by `combined.pop()`, `combined` now has one less element, `item` is the new second smallest element in `heap`, `max_profit` remains unchanged, `current_profit` is equal to `max_profit + item[0]`, and `removed_item` is True.**

This means that the `current_profit` has been updated by adding the first element of the `item` tuple (denoted as `item[0]`) to its previous value. All other variables remain in their previously described states.
