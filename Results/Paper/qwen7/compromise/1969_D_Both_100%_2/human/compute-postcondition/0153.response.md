Based on the initial state provided:

- `heap` will have had its second smallest element replaced multiple times.
- `combined` will be an empty list after all iterations.
- `max_profit` will be the highest `current_profit` value encountered during the loop's execution.
- `current_profit` reflects the net profit calculated based on the operations performed within the loop.
- `removed_item` will be True for each iteration where the operation `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` was executed.

The `print(max_profit)` statement will print the highest `current_profit` value that was observed during the loop's execution.

Output: **max_profit (where max_profit is the highest current_profit value encountered during the loop's execution)**
