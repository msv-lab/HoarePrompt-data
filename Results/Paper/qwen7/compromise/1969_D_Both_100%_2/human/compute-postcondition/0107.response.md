Postcondition: **After the if-else block executes, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. All other variables (`combined`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, and `current_profit`) retain their states from the last iteration of the loop.**
