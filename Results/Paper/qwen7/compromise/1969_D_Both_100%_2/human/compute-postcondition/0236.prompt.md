You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. prices is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ price_i ≤ 10^9 for Alice's prices, and bonuses is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ bonus_i ≤ 10^9 for Bob's prices.
def func_4():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        heap = []
        
        remaining_items = []
        
        n, k = func_2()
        
        prices = list(func_2())
        
        neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]
        
        bonuses = list(func_2())
        
        max_profit = 0
        
        current_profit = 0
        
        combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))
        
        combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
        
        for _ in range(k):
            if combined:
                heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
        
        if combined:
            current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
        
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
        
        while combined:
            item = combined.pop()
            if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
                current_profit -= item[1]
            else:
                current_profit += item[0]
            removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
            if removed_item:
                current_profit -= removed_item[0]
            if current_profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = current_profit
        
        print(max_profit)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `combined` will be an empty list, `heap` will contain exactly `k` elements which are the smallest elements from the original `combined` list (or fewer if there weren't enough elements), `current_profit` will reflect the final profit calculation based on the operations performed within the loop, and `max_profit` will hold the highest value of `current_profit` encountered during the entire execution of the loop. All other variables (`test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `prices`, `bonuses`, `n`) will remain unchanged from their initial states.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: t (a positive integer representing the number of test cases), prices (a list of n integers where each price_i is between 1 and 10^9), and bonuses (a list of n integers where each bonus_i is between 1 and 10^9). For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The function processes each test case and returns results based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
