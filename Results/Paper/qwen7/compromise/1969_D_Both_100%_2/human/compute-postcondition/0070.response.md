Postcondition: **`combined` has at least one item less than before, `current_profit` is reduced by the first element of the last item of the original `combined` list, `item` is now the last element of the original `combined` list, `heap` contains the `item` that was heappushed and heappopped, and `max_profit` remains unchanged if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`**.

This means that after executing the if-else block, the list `combined` will have at least one item less than it did before the operation. The variable `current_profit` will be decreased by the first element of the last item from the original `combined` list. The variable `item` will be the last element from the original `combined` list. The `heap` will contain the `item` that was pushed and popped. Lastly, if `current_profit` is still greater than `max_profit` after the reduction, `max_profit` will remain unchanged.
