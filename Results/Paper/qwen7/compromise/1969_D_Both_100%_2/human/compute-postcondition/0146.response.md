Output State: **`heap` has had its second smallest element replaced by `combined.pop()`, `combined` now has at least one element less, `item` is the new second smallest element in `heap`, `max_profit` remains unchanged, `removed_item` is True, `current_profit` is updated to `max_profit - 2 * item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, or `max_profit - item[1] - item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, and `current_profit` is further increased by `item[0]`, `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` has been executed, `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]`.**

In natural language: The `current_profit` is decreased by the value of `removed_item[0]`. All other conditions and values remain the same as before the execution of the code.
