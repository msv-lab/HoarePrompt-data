Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0; `heap` is an empty list; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the return value of `func_2()` and `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`**.

This means that the function `func_2()` has been called, and it has returned two values which are assigned to `n` and `k`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
