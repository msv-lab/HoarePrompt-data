Output State: **`heap` has had its second smallest element replaced by `combined.pop()`, `combined` now has one less element, `item` is the new second smallest element in `heap`, `max_profit` remains unchanged, `current_profit` is equal to `max_profit - item[1]`, and `removed_item` is True.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `item[1]` from `current_profit`. Since `item` is the new second smallest element in `heap`, `item[1]` represents the value of this element. Therefore, `current_profit` is updated to `max_profit - item[1]`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
