Postcondition: `combined` is now a list with one less item than before. If the sum of the first and second elements of the last item of the original `combined` list is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is reduced by the second element of the last item of the original `combined` list. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the first element of the last item in the original `combined` list, and `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list.
