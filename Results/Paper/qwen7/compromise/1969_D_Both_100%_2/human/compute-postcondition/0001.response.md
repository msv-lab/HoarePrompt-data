Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is simply `for _ in range(test_cases)`. The only variable mentioned here is `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state given is:
   - `test_cases` is the result of `func_1()`.
   - `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq n\).
   - `prices` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq price_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `bonuses` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq bonus_i \leq 10^9\).

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0. Since `test_cases` is the result of `func_1()`, we need to ensure that `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0.

4. **Adjusting the States**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `test_cases` to be greater than 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, and `bonuses`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `test_cases` to be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
