Output State: **`combined` has at least one item less than before, `current_profit` is reduced by the second element of the last item of the original `combined` list, `item` is now the last element of the original `combined` list, `heap` contains the `item` that was heappushed and heappopped, and `max_profit` remains unchanged if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.**

Explanation: The code `current_profit -= item[1]` subtracts the second element (index 1) of the last item of the original `combined` list from `current_profit`. All other variables remain in their respective states as described in the initial state.
