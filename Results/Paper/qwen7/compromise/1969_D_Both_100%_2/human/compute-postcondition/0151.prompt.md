Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the if-else block executes, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. All other variables (`combined`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, and `current_profit`) retain their states from the last iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `heap` has had its second smallest element replaced by `item`, `combined` is now a list with one less element, `item` is the new second smallest element in `heap`, `max_profit` remains unchanged, and `current_profit` is equal to `max_profit`, regardless of the condition in the if statement, and `removed_item` is True.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `heap` has had its second smallest element replaced by `combined.pop()`, `combined` now has one less element, `item` is the new second smallest element in `heap`, `max_profit` remains unchanged unless `current_profit > max_profit`, in which case `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`, `removed_item` is True, and `current_profit` is updated based on the value of `item[0] + item[1]`: - If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, then `current_profit` is `max_profit - item[1] - item[0]`. - If `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, then `current_profit` is `max_profit + item[0] - item[1]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `heap` has had its second smallest element replaced by `combined.pop()`, `combined` now has at least one element less, `item` is the new second smallest element in `heap`, `max_profit` remains unchanged, `removed_item` is True, `current_profit` is updated to `max_profit - 2 * item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, or `max_profit - item[1] - item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, and `current_profit` is further increased by `item[0]`, `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` has been executed, and `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]` if `removed_item` is True. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
