Output State: **`combined` will be empty, `heap` will contain the k smallest elements from the original combined list, `k` will be 0, `current_profit` is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `prices`, `bonuses`, and `n` will remain unchanged from their initial states.**

Explanation: The line `max_profit = current_profit` updates the value of `max_profit` to be the same as `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
