Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `heap` now contains the minimum element from `combined` and the previously existing elements.**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` pops an element from `combined` and pushes it into `heap`. Since `heap` is a min-heap, the new element is placed in such a way that the smallest element remains at the root. The precondition that `k` must be greater than 0 is unchanged. The `heap` now includes the popped element from `combined` along with any previously existing elements.
