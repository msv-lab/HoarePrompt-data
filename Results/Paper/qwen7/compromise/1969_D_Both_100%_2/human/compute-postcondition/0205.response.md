Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while combined:`. This means the loop continues as long as the list `combined` is not empty.

2. **Determine the States to Adjust**: The only state that directly affects the loop condition is the state of the `combined` list. For the loop to continue, `combined` must still contain at least one item.

3. **Current State After Previous Iteration**: 
   - `combined` is now a list with one less item than before.
   - `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list.
   - `heap` has had its last element replaced by `item`.
   - `current_profit` is increased by the second element of `item` because the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `max_profit` is now greater than `current_profit`.
   - `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`.

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop condition depends on `combined` not being empty, we need to ensure that `combined` still contains at least one item after the current iteration. Given that `combined` is a list with one less item than before, for the loop to continue, `combined` must still have at least one item.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of the `combined` list to ensure it still contains at least one item.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`combined` must still contain at least one item**
