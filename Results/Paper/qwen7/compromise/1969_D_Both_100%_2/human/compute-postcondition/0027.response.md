Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `combined` will be empty, `heap` will contain the `k` smallest elements from the original `combined` list (assuming `combined` had enough elements), `k` will be 0, `current_profit` is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)`, and all other variables (`max_profit`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `prices`, `bonuses`, `n`) will remain unchanged from their initial states.**

This means that after executing the line `current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)`, the `current_profit` variable will hold the result returned by the function `func_3` when passed the `combined` list and the `heap`. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the precondition.
