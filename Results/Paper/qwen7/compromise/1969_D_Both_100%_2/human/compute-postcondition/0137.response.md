Output State: **`heap` has had its second smallest element replaced by `combined.pop()`, `combined` now has one less element, `item` is the new second smallest element in `heap`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`, `removed_item` is True, and `current_profit` is updated based on the value of `item[0] + item[1]`: - If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, then `current_profit` is `max_profit - item[1] - item[0]`. - If `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, then `current_profit` is `max_profit + item[0] - item[1]`**.

This means that the `max_profit` has been updated to the current profit, which depends on whether `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than or equal to zero or less than zero. The other conditions remain the same as the initial state.
