Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `combined` will be empty, `heap` will contain the `k` smallest elements from the original `combined` list (assuming `combined` had enough elements), `k` will be 0, `current_profit` is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, and all other variables (`test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `prices`, `bonuses`, `n`) will remain unchanged from their initial states.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `combined` is now two items shorter, `heap` contains the k smallest elements from the original combined list excluding the last two popped items and the pushed item, `k` remains 0, `current_profit` is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]` as `item[0] + item[1] < 0` holds true, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` (since `max_profit` was previously the maximum of `current_profit` and `max_profit`), and all other variables (`test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `prices`, `bonuses`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `combined` is now a list with one less item than before; `current_profit` is reduced by the first element of the last item of the original `combined` list; `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list; `heap` contains the `item` that was heappushed and heappopped; if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `combined` has at least one item less than before, `current_profit` is reduced by the first element of the last item of the original `combined` list, `item` is now the last element of the original `combined` list, `heap` contains the `item` that was heappushed and heappopped, and `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
