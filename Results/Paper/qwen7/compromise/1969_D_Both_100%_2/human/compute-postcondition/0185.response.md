Postcondition: **After the if-else block executes, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations performed, and `heap` will contain up to `k` elements, which are the smallest elements from the `combined` list after popping them. If `combined` does not have enough elements to fill the `heap` with `k` elements, the remaining slots in the `heap` will be empty. The `combined` list will be non-empty; the current value of `current_profit` is either greater than `max_profit` and thus updated, or it remains the same.**
