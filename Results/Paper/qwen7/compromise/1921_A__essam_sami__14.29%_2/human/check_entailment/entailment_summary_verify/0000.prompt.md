You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        (c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        (e, f) = map(int, input().split())
        (g, h) = map(int, input().split())
        n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of four pairs of integer coordinates representing the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates the squared distance between two opposite corners and compares them. It then prints the smaller squared distance. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square in all cases. Specifically, the program assumes that the distance between any two points is a side length of the square, which is incorrect. The program calculates the squared distance between two points and prints the minimum of these distances, which will not necessarily give the correct side length of the square.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
```

The correct area of the square should be 4, but the program will incorrectly calculate the distance between (-1, 1) and (1, -1), which is \( \sqrt{8} \), and print 8 as the area. This is because the program does not properly identify the side lengths of the square.

To fix this, the program needs to identify the unique pairs of points that form the sides of the square and ensure that the calculated distances are consistent with the properties of a square.
