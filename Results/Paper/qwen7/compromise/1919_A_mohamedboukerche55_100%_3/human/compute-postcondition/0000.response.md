Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, the value of `t` remains within this range after executing the code. All other variables (`a` and `b`) are not mentioned in the initial state and are not affected by the given code snippet.
