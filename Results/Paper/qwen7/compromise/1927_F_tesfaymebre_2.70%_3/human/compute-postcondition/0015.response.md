Based on the initial state provided:

- `_min_edge` is the minimum weight of the edges that form a cycle.
- `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes involved in the cycle with the minimum weight edge.
- `colors` is a list of length `n+1` with all elements initialized to 0.
- `res` is the result of `dfs(node_u, -1, [])`.

The `dfs` function typically performs a depth-first search starting from `node_u` and avoiding the parent node `-1`. The result `res` would be a list of nodes visited during this traversal, forming a path from `node_u` to itself, thus creating a cycle.

Since the exact values of `_min_edge` and the specific nodes and edges are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the variables.

Output: **_min_edge, len(res) (where _min_edge is the minimum weight of the edges that form a cycle and len(res) is the number of nodes in the cycle formed by the dfs traversal)**
