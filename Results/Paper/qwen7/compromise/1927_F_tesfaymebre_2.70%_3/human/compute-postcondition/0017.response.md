The function `func_6` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `graph`. Here, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, `m` is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph, and `graph` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the graph where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of tuples containing adjacent vertices and their corresponding edge weights. Additionally, it accepts an `edges` list of tuples where each tuple contains the weight of an edge and the two vertices it connects.

The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_6` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, and `graph` along with an `edges` list, without specifying the exact operation to be performed on these inputs.
