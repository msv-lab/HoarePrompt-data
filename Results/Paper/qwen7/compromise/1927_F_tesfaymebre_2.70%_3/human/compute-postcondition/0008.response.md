Output State: **`colors` remains unchanged with `colors[curr]` set to 2, `curr` and `parent` remain unchanged with their respective values, `path` contains the current path being explored including `curr`.**

Explanation: The code `colors[curr] = 2` changes the value of `colors[curr]` from its initial value (which was 1) to 2. All other variables (`curr`, `parent`, and `path`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
