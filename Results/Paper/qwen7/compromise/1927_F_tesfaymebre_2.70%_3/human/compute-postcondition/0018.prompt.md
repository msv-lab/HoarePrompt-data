You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, m is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph, and graph is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the graph where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of tuples containing adjacent vertices and their corresponding edge weights. Additionally, edges is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the weight of an edge and the two vertices it connects.
def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
        graph[v].append(u)
        
        edges.append((w, u, v))
        
    #State: Output State: `n` vertices in the graph, `m` edges in the graph, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples, each tuple consisting of a weight `w` and two vertices `u` and `v` which represent an undirected edge between `u` and `v` in the graph. The graph dictionary `graph` has `n` keys, each corresponding to a vertex, and the value for each key is a list of vertices that are connected to it by an edge.
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    node_u = -1
    node_v = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
            if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
                _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
                node_u = u
                node_v = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
        
    #State: _min_edge is the minimum weight of the edges that form a cycle, node_u and node_v are the nodes involved in the cycle with the minimum weight edge.
    colors = [0] * (n + 1)
    res = dfs(node_u, -1, [])
    print(_min_edge, len(res))
    #This is printed: _min_edge, len(res) (where _min_edge is the minimum weight of the edges that form a cycle and len(res) is the number of nodes in the cycle formed by the dfs traversal)
    print(*res)
    #This is printed: node_u node_v (or any sequence of nodes forming the cycle, including node_u and node_v)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `graph`, along with an `edges` list, without specifying the exact operation to be performed on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
