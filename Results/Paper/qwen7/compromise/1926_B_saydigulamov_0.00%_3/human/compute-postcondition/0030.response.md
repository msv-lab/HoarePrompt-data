Postcondition: `b` is an input string from the user, and `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b`. If `b` contains the character '1', then `k` will be a list with the value `[1]`. If `b` does not contain the character '1', then `k` remains unchanged (i.e., `k` could be an empty list or any other list it might have been initialized as).
