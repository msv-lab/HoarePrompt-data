Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is the count of '1' in the string `b` plus 1, `k` is now an empty list, and `b` is the final input string from `input()` after all iterations.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `b` is an input string from the user, and `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b`. If the string `b` contains the character '1', then `k` will have the value `[1]`. If the string `b` does not contain the character '1', then `k` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `b` is an input string from the user, and `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b`; after executing the if-else block, `k` will be `[b.count('1')]` if the string `b` contains the character '1', and `k` remains unchanged if the string `b` does not contain the character '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b` is an input string from the user. After the if else block executes, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the updated string `b`. If the string `b` contains the character '1', `k` is updated to include the count of '1' in the new string `b`. If the string `b` does not contain the character '1', `k` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
