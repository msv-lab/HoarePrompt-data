You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of '0's and '1's. For each grid, it counts the number of '1's and checks if the '1's form a square or a triangle. If the counts match, it prints the counts. The function does not return any value but prints the counts of '1's if they form a square or a triangle.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the size of the grid.
   - Then, it reads `n` lines of input, each containing `n` characters ('0' or '1').

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `k` to store the count of '1's in each row.
   - For each row, it counts the number of '1's and appends this count to `k`.

3. **Checking for Square or Triangle:**
   - The program checks if the first element in `k` is equal to the second element (`k[0] == k[1]`).
   - If they are equal, it prints `k`, which is not meaningful according to the problem statement.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Shape:**
   - The program only checks the first two elements of `k` to determine if the shape is a square. This logic is insufficient because:
     - For a square, all rows should have the same number of '1's.
     - For a triangle, the counts of '1's in rows should follow a specific pattern (e.g., 1, 3, 5, ...).

2. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints `k` instead of printing "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE". This does not meet the requirement of the problem.

### Correct Solution:

To correctly determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle, we need to:
- Check if all rows have the same number of '1's (indicating a square).
- Check if the counts of '1's in rows follow the pattern of a triangle.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        k = []
        for _ in range(n):
            b = input().strip()
            k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        # Check for square
        if len(set(k)) == 1 and k[0] >= 2:
            print("SQUARE")
        else:
            # Check for triangle
            if k[0] == 1 and all(k[i+1] == k[i] + 2 for i in range(len(k)-1)):
                print("TRIANGLE")
            else:
                print("TRIANGLE")  # Default to triangle if neither condition matches

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect because it does not properly check for the shape and outputs the wrong information. Therefore, the given program is **Incorrect**.

**Correctness: **False**
