Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid forms a square or a triangle. The program only counts the number of '1's in each row and checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal. This approach is insufficient to determine the shape because:

1. **Square Check**: For a square, the count of '1's should be `k` in each of the `k` rows, but the program does not check this condition.
2. **Triangle Check**: For a triangle, the counts should follow the pattern `1, 3, 5, ...`, but the program does not verify this pattern either.
3. **Output**: The program prints the counts of '1's if they are equal in the first two rows, which is not a reliable way to determine the shape.

Given these issues, the program will not correctly identify the shapes in the grids as required.

Correctness: **False**
