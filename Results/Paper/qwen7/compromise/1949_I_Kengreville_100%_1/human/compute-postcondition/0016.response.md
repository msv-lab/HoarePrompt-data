Based on the initial state provided:

- `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not equal to 0.
- `n` is an integer.
- `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with elements being integers.
- `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to True.
- `coef` is a list of length `n` where some elements may be set to 1 and others remain None.
- `tot` is the sum of all `tot` values from successful `dfs` calls.
- `ok` is True.

The `print('YES')` statement directly prints the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
