Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the loop index, and it starts from 0 in the `range(n)` function.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` should be 0 initially, and `n` should be a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, we don't need to change its value.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is a positive integer to allow the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be a positive integer.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` must be a positive integer**
