Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `y` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `r` is a list of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` initialized to False, and `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to None.**

Explanation: The code `y = [None] * n` initializes the list `y` to a list of `n` elements, each set to `None`. The other lists (`x`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
