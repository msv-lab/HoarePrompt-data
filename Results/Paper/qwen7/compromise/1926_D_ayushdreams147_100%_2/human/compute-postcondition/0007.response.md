Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of integers, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers. It returns the number of unique elements in the list `a`. The function iterates through the list `a`, using a dictionary `count` to track occurrences of each element after applying a bitwise operation. If an element appears for the first time, it increments the result counter `res`. If an element has been seen before, it decrements its count in `count`; if its count reaches zero, it removes it from `count`. After processing all elements, the function returns the value of `res`, which represents the number of unique elements in the list `a`.**
