### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires dividing numbers into groups such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value at any position from 1 to 31. This means that for any two numbers \(x\) and \(y\) in the same group, \(x_2(i) \neq y_2(i)\) for all \(1 \leq i < 32\).

2. **Key Insight**: The solution provided uses a clever approach where it considers the bitwise complement of each number. Specifically, it uses the expression \((1 << 31) - 1 \oplus num\), which flips all the bits of `num`. If two numbers \(x\) and \(y\) have different bits at every position, their complements will also have different bits at every position. Therefore, by mapping each number to its complement and counting the unique mappings, we can determine the minimum number of groups needed.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a result counter `res` and a dictionary `count`.
   - It iterates through each number in the list `a`.
   - For each number, it checks if the number is already in the dictionary `count`. If not, it adds the complement of the number to the dictionary and increments the result counter.
   - If the number is already in the dictionary, it decrements the count and removes the entry if the count reaches zero.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly identifies pairs of numbers that can be in the same group by using their complements.
   - The use of the complement ensures that if two numbers have different bits at every position, their complements will also have different bits at every position.
   - The dictionary `count` keeps track of the unique complements, effectively determining the minimum number of groups needed.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
