Output State: **`t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` is the second integer input split from `input().split()`**.

This means that the initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The code reads two integers from user input, splits them using `.split()`, and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. These two integers are then assigned to `n` and `m` respectively.
