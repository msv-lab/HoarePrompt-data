Postcondition: `t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 3, `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` must be at least 3, `count` is 1, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / count`, `g` is `n / 1`, and if `g < countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
