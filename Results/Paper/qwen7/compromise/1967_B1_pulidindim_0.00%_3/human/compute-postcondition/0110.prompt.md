Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and it is guaranteed that for each test case, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. Additionally, the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    count = 2
    ans = n
    while count <= m:
        countmins = count - 1
        g = n / count
        if g < countmins:
            break
        g -= countmins
        ans += g / count + 1
        count += 1
    print(int(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` is greater than `count - 1`, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 + 1) + (n / 3 + 1) + ... + (n / (m - 1) + 1)`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / m`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `count` will be equal to `m + 1` because the loop increments `count` until it is greater than `m`. The variable `ans` accumulates the sum of `n / (count - 1) + 1` for each iteration of the loop, starting from `count` being 3 up to `m`. The value of `countmins` remains 0 as it is set to `count - 1` and then decremented within the loop, but never used again. The variable `g` is updated in each iteration to be `n / count`, which becomes `n / m` in the final iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 3, `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` is at least 3, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is `(29n / 16) + (m - 1)`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / (m + 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `count` will be equal to `m + 1` because the loop increments `count` until it reaches `m + 1`. The variable `ans` accumulates the sum of `g / count + 1` for each iteration, starting from `count = 2` up to `count = m`. Given the pattern observed, the final value of `ans` can be expressed as `(29n / 16) + (m - 1)`. The variables `countmins` and `g` are updated within the loop and their final values depend on the last iteration, where `g` is `n / (m + 1)` and `countmins` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 4, `n` is the new integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` is at least 3, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is `n + (n / (m + 1) - 1) + (n / (4 * (m + 1)) - 3 / 5 + 1) + (n / ((m + 1) * (m + 1)) - (m + 1 - 1) / (m + 1) + 1)`, `countmins` is `m`, `g` is `n / ((m + 1) * (m + 1)) - m / (m + 1) + 1`.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop, the variable `count` will be `m + 1`. The variable `ans` accumulates the sum of `g / count + 1` for each iteration from `count = 3` to `count = m + 1`. The variable `countmins` will be `m` when the loop ends. The variable `g` will be updated in the last iteration as `n / ((m + 1) * (m + 1)) - m / (m + 1) + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
