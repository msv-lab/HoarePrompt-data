Output State: **`t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` must be greater than 3, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 + 1)`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / 4`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change any variable values but indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
