Output State: **`t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 4, `n` is the new integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` is at least 3, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / (m + 1)`**

Explanation: The line `ans = n` simply assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
