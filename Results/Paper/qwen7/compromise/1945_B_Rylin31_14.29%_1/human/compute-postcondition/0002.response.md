Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed as a result of the loop's execution. For each iteration `i` from `0` to `t-1`, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input, calculates `mn` as `min(a, b) + m`, and then checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` without either being 1. If true, it prints `mn // a + mn // b + 1`; otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`. The final output state is a list of these printed integers.
