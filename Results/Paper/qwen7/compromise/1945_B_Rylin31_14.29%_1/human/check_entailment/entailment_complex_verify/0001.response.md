### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes.
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The visibility period of a firework launched at time `x` is from `x` to `x + m`.
   - To maximize the number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.

3. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code calculates `mn = min(a, b) + m`, which is incorrect for determining the LCM.
   - It then checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and prints a formula involving `mn // a` and `mn // b`.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves calculating the LCM of `a` and `b` and then determining how many fireworks can be launched within the visibility period.
   - The formula should be based on the LCM of `a` and `b` and the visibility period `m`.

5. **Issues in the Given Code:**
   - The calculation of `mn` is incorrect.
   - The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1)` is unnecessary and does not correctly handle the LCM.
   - The final print statement uses `mn // a + mn // b`, which is not the correct way to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code states that the function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\).
   - For each test case, it calculates `mn` as `min(a, b) + m`, which is incorrect.
   - It then checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and prints a formula involving `mn // a` and `mn // b`.

7. **Correct Solution:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to use the LCM of `a` and `b` and the visibility period `m`.
   - The maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{max\_fireworks} = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{\text{lcm}(a, b)} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - Where \(\text{lcm}(a, b)\) is the least common multiple of `a` and `b`.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The given code does not correctly solve the problem because it incorrectly calculates `mn` and does not use the LCM of `a` and `b`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. The solution should use the LCM of `a` and `b` and the visibility period `m` to calculate the correct number of fireworks visible at any given time.
