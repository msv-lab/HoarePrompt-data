Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program simply prints `k - 1` for every test case, regardless of the input values. This is clearly wrong because the number of cards remaining depends on the distribution of the card numbers and the value of `k`.

2. **No Handling of Card Counts**: The program does not account for the actual counts of each card number. It should reduce the count of cards by performing the allowed operations optimally, but the current implementation does not do this.

3. **No Optimization**: The program does not attempt to minimize the number of cards by repeatedly applying the operation to groups of `k` identical cards until it cannot be applied anymore.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:
- Count the occurrences of each card number.
- Determine the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further by the given operation.

A more appropriate approach would involve iterating over the counts of each card number and determining how many full sets of `k` cards can be formed, then calculating the remainder to find the minimum number of cards left.
