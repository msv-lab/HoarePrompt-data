Output State: **t lines of "k - 1" where each "k" is an integer read from the input during the corresponding iteration.**

This means that for each line of input processed within the loop, the program will print `k - 1`, where `k` is an integer provided as input for that iteration. The number of such lines will be equal to the value of `t`, which was initially read as an integer input.
