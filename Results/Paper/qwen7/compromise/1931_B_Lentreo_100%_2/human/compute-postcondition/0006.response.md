Output State: **`curr` is 0, `n` is the length of `nums`, and the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`, `total` is the sum of `nums`, `mean` is `total // n`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `curr` to 0. The values of `n`, `total`, and `mean` remain unchanged from their initial state since no operations are performed on them. Therefore, the only new information is that `curr` is now 0.
