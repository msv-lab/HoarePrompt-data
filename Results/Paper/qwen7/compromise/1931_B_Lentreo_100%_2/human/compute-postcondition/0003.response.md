Output State: **The program returns 'NO'**

Given the initial state where `n` is the length of `nums`, and the sum of `nums` is not divisible by `n`, the code simply returns `'NO'`. Since no other operations are performed on any variables, the only information we have to consider is the return statement itself. Therefore, the program returns the string `'NO'`.
