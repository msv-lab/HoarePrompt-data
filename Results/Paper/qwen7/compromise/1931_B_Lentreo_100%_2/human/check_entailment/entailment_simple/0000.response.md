### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers equal by pouring water between them according to the given rules. The key observation here is that if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, it is always possible to distribute the water equally among all containers. This is because we can always transfer water from containers with more water to those with less until all containers have the same amount of water.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers (`n`) and the amounts of water in each container (`nums`).
   - The function `func_1(nums)` checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - If the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, it calculates the mean amount of water per container (`mean`).
   - It then iterates through the list `nums` and keeps track of the difference between the current sum of the elements and the expected sum if all elements were equal to `mean`. If at any point this difference becomes negative, it means that it's not possible to distribute the water equally, and the function returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to distribute the water equally, and the function returns 'YES'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where the total amount of water is not divisible by `n` by immediately returning 'NO'.
   - The code also correctly handles the case where the total amount of water is divisible by `n` and ensures that the distribution is possible.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
