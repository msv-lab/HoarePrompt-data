### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step based on the annotated code and the problem description.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container stored in the list `nums`.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The program calculates the total amount of water `total` and checks if it is divisible by `n`.
   - If `total % n != 0`, it immediately returns "NO". This check is crucial because if the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, it is impossible to distribute the water evenly among the containers.

3. **Mean Calculation**:
   - The mean amount of water per container is calculated as `mean = total // n`.

4. **Balance Check**:
   - The program iterates through the containers and maintains a running sum `curr` of the differences between the current container's water amount and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that the cumulative difference from the mean has become negative, indicating an imbalance that cannot be corrected by pouring water from one container to another.
   - If the loop completes without returning "NO", it means that the cumulative difference remains non-negative, and thus the water can be distributed evenly.

### Evaluation Based on Annotations:

- **State Before Function Call**:
  - `nums` is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container.
  - The length of `nums` is `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5).
  - The sum of `nums` is divisible by `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^9).

- **Function Logic**:
  - The function first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns "NO".
  - If the total is divisible by `n`, it proceeds to calculate the mean.
  - It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a running sum of the differences from the mean.
  - If the running sum ever becomes negative, it returns "NO".
  - If the loop completes without returning "NO", it returns "YES".

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The initial assessment is accurate. The program handles all valid cases correctly and there are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
