Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operations. Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Mean Calculation**: For each test case, it calculates the mean amount of water per container by dividing the total amount of water by the number of containers.
3. **Cumulative Difference Check**: It iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a running sum of the differences between each container's water amount and the mean. If at any point this running sum becomes negative, it means that it's impossible to balance the water across all containers, and the function returns 'NO'.
4. **Final Check**: If the loop completes without returning 'NO', it means that the water can be balanced, and the function returns 'YES'.

Given the execution summary, the program accurately follows the steps required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
