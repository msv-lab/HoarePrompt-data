Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container index must be less than the destination container index.

2. **Key Insight**: Given that the sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers (`n`), the target amount of water in each container would be `total / n`, where `total` is the sum of water in all containers.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the mean amount of water per container.
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts and checks if the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the mean becomes negative at any point. If it does, it means we cannot achieve equal distribution without violating the pouring rule (since we would need to pour water from a container with less water to a container with more, which is not allowed).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, returning "NO".
   - The program correctly checks if it's possible to redistribute the water such that no negative difference occurs during the process.

5. **Implementation Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The input handling and loop structure are appropriate for the given constraints.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
