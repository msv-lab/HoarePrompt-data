Output State: **`cur` is 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `num` is the next element in `N`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since there was no loop or conditional block provided in the code snippet, the only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. All other variables retain their initial states.
