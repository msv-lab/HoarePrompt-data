Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `cur`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `cur` is greater than 0. This is because the loop runs for `range(cur)`, meaning it will run `cur` times.

3. **Determine the initial state of `cur`**: From the given information, `cur` is increased by 1 if the sum of all values in `M` equals `S`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. Therefore, the value of `cur` could either be 1 or 0 depending on the outcome of the if-else block.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop will only execute if `cur` is greater than 0, we need to ensure that `cur` is at least 1 for the loop to start executing.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `cur` is at least 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`cur` must be at least 1**
