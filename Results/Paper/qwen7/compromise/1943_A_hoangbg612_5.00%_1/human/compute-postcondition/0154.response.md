Output State: **`cur` is equal to `num`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 to become 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] = 1` sets the value of `M[cur]` to 1. Given the initial state where `M[cur]` was already incremented by 1, it means `M[cur]` was initially 1, and now it is incremented to 2. The values of `cur` and `num` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
