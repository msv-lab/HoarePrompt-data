Postcondition: `num` and `cur` are integers. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur` is an integer greater than `num` by more than 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `num` is not greater than `cur + 1`, the postcondition remains as the precondition, meaning `num` is still an integer greater than `cur`.
