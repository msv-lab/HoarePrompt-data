Postcondition: `cur` is 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the current value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then the condition is met and we break out. Otherwise, since there is no else part, the condition remains unmet and we still break out.
