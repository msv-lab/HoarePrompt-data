Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, `cur` is incremented by 1, `M[cur]` is the count of occurrences of `cur`.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. The values of `N`, `num`, and `M[cur]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
