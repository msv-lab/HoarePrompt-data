Output State: **`M` is a list of integers, `i` is within the bounds of `M`, `cur` is equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The code `cur = i` assigns the value of `i` to `cur`. The other variables (`M`, `i`, and `i_prev`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition that `cur` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 1` is not directly impacted by this assignment, but it is still a valid condition.
