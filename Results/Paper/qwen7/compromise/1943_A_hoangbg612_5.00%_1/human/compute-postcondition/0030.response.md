Postcondition: `num` is the next integer from the list `N`, `cur` is an integer, and `M[cur]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `num` is greater than `cur`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `cur` is increased by 1 and `M[cur]` is set to 1; otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.
