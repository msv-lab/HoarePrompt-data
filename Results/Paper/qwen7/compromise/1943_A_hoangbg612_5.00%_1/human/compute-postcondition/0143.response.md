Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `M[cur]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value 1 to the dictionary `M` at the key `cur`. Since `cur` is initially equal to `num`, `M[cur]` (which is `M[num]`) is set to 1. The other variables and the list `N` remain unchanged.
