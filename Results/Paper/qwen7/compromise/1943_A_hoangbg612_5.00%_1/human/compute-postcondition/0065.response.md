Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(T)`. The key variables here are `T` (the total number of iterations) and the loop counter `_`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as the loop counter `_` is less than `T`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `cur` remains 0 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).
   - The loop counter `_` has just completed one iteration.

4. **Determine the Next State**: For the loop to execute one more time, the loop counter `_` must be less than `T`. Since `_` has just completed one iteration, it is now equal to the previous value of `_` plus 1. Therefore, `_` is now 1.

5. **Adjust the State**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is the loop counter `_`, which should now be 1. The value of `cur` remains unchanged.

**Final State**:
State: **`cur` remains 0, and `_` is 1**
