Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in N:`. The objects involved here are `num` and `N`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `num` and `N`**:
   - `num` is a variable that will take on the value of each element in the list `N` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `N`. Therefore, the loop can only execute if `N` is not empty.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `num` will take on the values from `N`, we don't need to explicitly set its initial value (it will be set to the first element of `N` when the loop starts).
   - We need to ensure that `N` is not empty for the loop to execute.

Given the above points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `N` must not be empty.

**Final State:**
State: **`cur` is -1, `T` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` must not be empty, `M` is an empty dictionary**
