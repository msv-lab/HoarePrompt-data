Postcondition: `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, `cur` is the current maximum value encountered so far, and `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `num` is not greater than `cur`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `num` is assigned to `cur` and `M[cur]` is set to 1.
