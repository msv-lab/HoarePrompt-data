Output State: **`num` is assigned to `cur`; `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element; `num` is the next element in the list; `M[cur]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `M[cur]` to 1. This means that the value of `M[cur]` is now 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
