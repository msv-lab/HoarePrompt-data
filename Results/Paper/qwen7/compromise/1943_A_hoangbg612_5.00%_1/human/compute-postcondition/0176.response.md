Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `cur`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < cur`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cur` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, then `cur` is set to `i` and the loop exits.
   - If `M[i]` is greater than `i`, then no change is made to `cur`.

4. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - Since the exact value of `cur` is not specified, we know it is some integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < cur`.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - Therefore, if `i` was previously `k`, it will now be `k + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `k + 1` must still be less than `cur`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `cur` remains unchanged unless `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i` during the current iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the increment of `i` and the unchanged value of `cur`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cur` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `cur` remains unchanged**.
