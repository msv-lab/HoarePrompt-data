Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `cur`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < cur`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `cur` is 0 (from the postcondition given)

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be 1.
   - However, the loop will only continue if `i < cur`. Given that `cur` is currently 0, `i` cannot be incremented further because `1 is not less than 0`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `cur` is 0, the loop will not execute again because the condition `i < cur` will never be true.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time because the loop will not run again due to the current value of `cur`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `cur` is 0**
