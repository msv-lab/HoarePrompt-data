Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `cur` is 0

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `cur`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - Since `cur` is 0, the range `range(cur)` is an empty range.

4. **Loop Execution:**
   - Given that `cur` is 0, the range `range(0)` is empty, meaning the loop body will not execute at all because there are no values of `i` in the range.

5. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop does not execute at all (because `cur` is 0), there are no changes to `i` or `cur`.
   - Therefore, the states remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0 and `cur` is 0**
