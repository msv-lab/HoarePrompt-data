Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, `cur` is incremented by 1, `M[cur]` is the count of occurrences of `cur`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `N`, `num`, `cur`, and `M[cur]` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block it was in.
