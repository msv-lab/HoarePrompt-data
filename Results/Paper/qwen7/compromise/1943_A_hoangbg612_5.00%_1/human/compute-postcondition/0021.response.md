Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `num` which iterates over the list `N`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `N` to iterate over.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is an integer, `cur` is an integer, and `M[cur]` is updated based on the conditions provided.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be the next element from the list `N`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `num`: This will be the next element from the list `N`.
   - `cur`: This remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, it stays the same.
   - `M[cur]`: Since the update condition depends on `num`, and `num` changes, `M[cur]` might change again based on the new value of `num`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next `num` from the list `N`.

**State:**
- `num` is the next integer from the list `N`.
- `cur` is the same as before (unchanged).
- `M[cur]` might be updated based on the new `num`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `num` from the list `N` for the next iteration, we can represent it as the next element in the list `N`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`num` is the next integer from the list `N`, `cur` is an integer, and `M[cur]` is updated based on the conditions provided.**
