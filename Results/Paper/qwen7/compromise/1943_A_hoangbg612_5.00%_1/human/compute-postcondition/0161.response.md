Output State: **`num` is assigned to `cur`; `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element; `num` is the next element in the list; if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur` is incremented by 1 and `M[cur]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` simply assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. The conditions regarding the relationship between `num`, `cur`, and `M[cur]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is that `cur` now holds the value of `num`. All other variables and conditions stay the same as per the initial state.
