Postcondition: **`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, `cur` is the current maximum value encountered so far, and `M[cur]` is the count of occurrences of `cur`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is equal to `num`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 to become 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
