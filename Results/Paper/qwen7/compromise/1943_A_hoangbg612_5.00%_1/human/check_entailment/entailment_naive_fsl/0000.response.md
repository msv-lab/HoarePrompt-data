Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a`. Instead, it sorts the array and tries to determine the MEX of the resulting array, which does not reflect the game's rules.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

The output of the program is:
```
2
1
0
```

However, let's analyze the first test case:
- Alice picks 1, so `a` becomes `[0, 0]` and `c` becomes `[1]`.
- Bob picks 0, so `a` becomes `[0]` and `c` remains `[1]`.
- Alice picks 0, so `a` becomes `[]` and `c` becomes `[1, 0]`.

The MEX of `[1, 0]` is 2, which matches the expected output. However, the program does not simulate the turns correctly. It simply sorts the array and determines the MEX, which does not reflect the game's dynamic nature.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and ensure that Alice always appends to her list and Bob always removes without appending. The current implementation does not handle this logic properly.
