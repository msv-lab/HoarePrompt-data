You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = -1
        M = {}
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
            cur += 1
        for i in range(cur):
            if M[i] <= i:
                cur = i
                break
        print(cur)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t`, a positive integer `n`, and a list `N` of `n` non-negative integers. For each test case, it sorts the list `N` and then determines the smallest integer `i` such that the count of `i` in `N` is greater than `i` itself. If no such integer exists, it returns the total count of unique integers in `N`. The function prints and returns this value for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the elements of the array `N`.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The array `N` is sorted. This step is unnecessary for solving the problem since the order of elements does not affect the MEX calculation directly. However, sorting might help in some specific scenarios, but it is not necessary here.

3. **Initialization**:
   - A variable `cur` is initialized to -1.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the counts of each number in the array.

4. **Processing the Array**:
   - The program iterates through each number in the sorted array `N`.
   - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it updates the count in the dictionary `M` and sets `cur` to `num`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation**:
   - The program checks if the sum of counts in the dictionary `M` equals the size of the array `S`.
   - If true, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then iterates from 0 to `cur` to find the smallest index `i` where the count of `i` is less than or equal to `i`. This index `i` is the final MEX value.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **MEX Calculation Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating the MEX is flawed. The program tries to find the smallest number that is not present in the array by counting occurrences and checking conditions. However, it does not correctly simulate the game rules where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements.

2. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice picks elements and appends them to `c` and removes them from `a`.
   - Bob only removes elements from `a`.
   - The program does not simulate these rules properly. It simply counts occurrences without considering whose turn it is or how the elements are appended to `c`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The optimal strategy involves ensuring that Alice maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it. The program does not account for this strategic behavior.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem according to the game rules and optimal strategies. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
