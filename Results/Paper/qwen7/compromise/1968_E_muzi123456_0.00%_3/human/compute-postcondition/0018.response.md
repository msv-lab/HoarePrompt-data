Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is initially greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`. This condition can only be true if `t` is 1 (since 1 is greater than 0 and 1 equals 1 - 1). The code then assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. Since the initial state of `t` is specified but its exact value is not needed for the final output state, we keep it as "greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`". The value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user.
