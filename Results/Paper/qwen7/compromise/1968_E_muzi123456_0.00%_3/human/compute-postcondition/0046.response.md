Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, inclusive, `i` is equal to `n`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be 0 because the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `n` retains its original input integer value as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n` in each iteration, and after all iterations, `i` will reach `n`.
