Output State: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be 4 (since the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n`), and `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to complete all its iterations. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
