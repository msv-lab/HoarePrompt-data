Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `t` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, making it greater than 0 (since it was initially greater than 1). The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code snippet.
