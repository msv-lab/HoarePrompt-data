Based on the initial state described, the loop will print '1' followed by each integer from 1 to `n` exactly once. After the loop completes, the value of `i` will be `n + 1`, but this value is not printed. The only thing printed is the newline character represented by `print(' ')`.

Output: **a newline character**
