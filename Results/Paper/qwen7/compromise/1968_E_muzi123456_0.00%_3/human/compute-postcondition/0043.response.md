Output State: The loop will print '1' followed by each integer from 1 to n exactly once.

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the output will consist of the string '1' followed by each integer from 1 to n printed on the same line, separated by spaces. This means the output will look like "1 1 2 3 ... (up to n)" if n is greater than 1, or simply "1" if n is 1.
