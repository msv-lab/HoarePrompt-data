Output State: The loop will print '1' followed by each integer from 1 to n exactly once.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive. The variable `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution. The loop prints '1' followed by each integer from 1 to `n` on the same line, separated by spaces. Therefore, the final output will be a sequence of '1' followed by all integers from 1 to `n` printed consecutively without any new lines.
