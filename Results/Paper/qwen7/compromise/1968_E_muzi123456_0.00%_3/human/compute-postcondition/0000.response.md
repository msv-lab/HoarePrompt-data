Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive; `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 50` is maintained. However, since no input for `n` has been provided yet, `n` remains as an integer between `2` and `10^3`, inclusive.
