Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) which contains distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells.
2. The provided solution generates a simple pattern where all y-coordinates are 1 and x-coordinates range from 1 to \(n\). Specifically, the coordinates generated are \((1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), \ldots, (n, 1)\).
3. Let's analyze the Manhattan distances for this configuration:
   - The distance between any two cells \((i, 1)\) and \((j, 1)\) is \(|i - j|\).
   - For \(n\) cells, the possible distances are \(0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\).
4. This means the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain exactly \(n\) distinct values: \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\).
5. The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is therefore \(n\), which is the maximum possible size for the given constraints.
6. Since the problem does not specify any other constraints or patterns that would yield a larger \(\mathcal{H}\), this solution appears to be correct.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Correctness: **True**
