Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\). The program simply prints the points \((1, i)\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(n\), which does not necessarily maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

To solve this problem correctly, a more strategic placement of points is required. For example, for \(n=3\), the optimal arrangement would be \((2,1)\), \((2,3)\), and \((3,1)\) as shown in the note, which gives a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances. The provided solution does not achieve this and thus is incorrect.
