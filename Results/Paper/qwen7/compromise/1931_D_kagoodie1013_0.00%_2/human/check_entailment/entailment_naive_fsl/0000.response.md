Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding beautiful pairs. Specifically, the program uses `mod_x = -num % x` which is incorrect because it does not handle negative numbers properly. This can lead to incorrect results when checking if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.

For example, consider the following input:
- \( n = 4 \)
- \( x = 5 \)
- \( y = 2 \)
- \( a = [1, 2, 7, 4] \)

The correct beautiful pairs are:
- \(\langle 1, 5 \rangle\) (not applicable since \(j > n\))
- \(\langle 1, 4 \rangle\): \(a_1 + a_4 = 1 + 4 = 5\) (divisible by 5) and \(a_1 - a_4 = 1 - 4 = -3\) (not divisible by 2)
- \(\langle 2, 4 \rangle\): \(a_2 + a_4 = 2 + 4 = 6\) (divisible by 5) and \(a_2 - a_4 = 2 - 4 = -2\) (divisible by 2)

However, the program will miss these pairs due to the incorrect modulo calculation for negative numbers. For instance, `-num % x` will not give the correct remainder for negative numbers, leading to incorrect pair counts.

To fix this, the program should use `(num - 1) % x + 1` instead of `-num % x` to ensure correct handling of negative numbers.
