Output State: **`count` is 0, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is a remainder when elements of `arr` are divided by `y` and each value is the count of occurrences of that remainder, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `test_cases` must have at least one more element**

Explanation: The line `mod_x_map = {}` initializes `mod_x_map` as an empty dictionary. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
