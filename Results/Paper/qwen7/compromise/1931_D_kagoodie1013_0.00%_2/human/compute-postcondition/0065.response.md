Output State: **`count` is 0, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary where each key is a remainder when elements of `arr` are divided by `x` and each value is the count of occurrences of that remainder, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is a remainder when elements of `arr` are divided by `y` and each value is the count of occurrences of that remainder, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `test_cases` must have at least one more element**

Explanation: The code sets `count` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `count` is now 0, while `num`, `mod_x_key`, `mod_y_key`, `mod_x_map`, `mod_y_map`, `results`, and `test_cases` retain their initial values.
