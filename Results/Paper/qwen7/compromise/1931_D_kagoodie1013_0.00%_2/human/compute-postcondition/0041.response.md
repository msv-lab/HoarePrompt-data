Output State: **`count` is 0 + `mod_x_map.get(-num % x, 0)` + `mod_y_map.get(num % y, 0)`, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `results` is `[0]`, `mod_y` is `num % y`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num % x` to `mod_x_key`. Since `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are dictionaries, their current state remains unchanged (empty). The value of `count` is updated to include `mod_x_key` instead of `mod_x`. The other variables remain in their initial states.
