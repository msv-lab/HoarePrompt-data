Output State: **`count` is 0, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `-num % x`, `mod_x_map` is {'-num % x': 1}, `mod_y_map` is {'num % y': 1}, `results` is [0], `mod_y` is `num % y`**

Explanation: The code calculates `mod_y` which is `num % y`. This value is assigned to `mod_y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
