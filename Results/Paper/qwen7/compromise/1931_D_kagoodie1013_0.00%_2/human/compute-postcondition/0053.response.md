Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in arr`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `count` is 2
   - `num` is the second element of `arr`
   - `mod_x_key` is `num % x`
   - `mod_x_map` is {'`num % x`': 2}
   - `mod_y_map` is {'`num % y`': 2}
   - `results` is [0]
   - `mod_y_key` is `num % y`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `arr`. Since `num` is currently set to the second element of `arr`, the loop will continue if there is a third element in `arr`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `num` will be set to the third element of `arr`.
   - `count` will be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - `mod_x_key` will be updated to `num % x` where `num` is now the third element.
   - `mod_x_map` will be updated based on the new value of `num % x`.
   - `mod_y_key` will be updated to `num % y` where `num` is now the third element.
   - `mod_y_map` will be updated based on the new value of `num % y`.
   - `results` will remain unchanged until the loop body updates it.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `count` will be 3.
   - `num` will be the third element of `arr`.
   - `mod_x_key` will be `num % x`.
   - `mod_x_map` will be updated based on the new value of `num % x`.
   - `mod_y_key` will be `num % y`.
   - `mod_y_map` will be updated based on the new value of `num % y`.
   - `results` will remain [0] unless the loop body modifies it.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`count` is 3, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_x_map` is updated based on the new value of `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, `mod_y_map` is updated based on the new value of `num % y`, `results` is [0]**
