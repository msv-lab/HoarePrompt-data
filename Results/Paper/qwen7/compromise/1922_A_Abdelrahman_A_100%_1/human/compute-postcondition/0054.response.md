Postcondition: `c` must have at least one character. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is also not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If either `x` is in `a[counter]` or `x` is in `b[counter]`, the loop or if statement continues without changing the value of `no`.
