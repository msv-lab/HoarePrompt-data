Output State: **`counter` is incremented by 1, the value of `no` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where `c` must contain elements for the loop to execute one more time. The values of `counter` and `no` remain unchanged.
