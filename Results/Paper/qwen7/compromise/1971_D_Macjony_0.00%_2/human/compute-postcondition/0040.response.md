Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string with its length greater than 3, `count` is equal to the length of `s` minus 1, `flag` is True, and `j` is equal to the length of `s` minus 1. If the condition `flag` is True, then `count` is decremented by 1.
