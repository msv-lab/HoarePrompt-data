Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 3, `s` is the new input string, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, `j` is 4**.

Explanation: The variable `j` is incremented by 1, starting from its initial value of 3 (as given in the initial state). Therefore, the new value of `j` is 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
