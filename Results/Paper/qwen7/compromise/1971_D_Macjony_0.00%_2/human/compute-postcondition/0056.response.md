Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input string with its length greater than 3, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, and `j` is 1. If the current value of `s[j]` is '0' and the current value of `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `flag` is set to True and `j` is set to 1.
