State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(t):` will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer greater than 0.
2. The variable `t` is defined as an integer input from the user, which is guaranteed to be between 1 and 500 inclusive.
3. The loop starts with `i` being 0 (as per the `range(t)` syntax), but since the loop will start executing, `i` will be incremented to 1 in the first iteration.
4. Therefore, the only variables involved in the loop head are `t` and `i`. We need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer and `i` is set to 1 for the loop to start executing.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions:
- `t` should be a positive integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
- `i` should be 1, as this is the starting value for the loop.
