Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `-1`, `res` is `0`, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The line `res = 0` initializes the variable `res` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `mdx`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
