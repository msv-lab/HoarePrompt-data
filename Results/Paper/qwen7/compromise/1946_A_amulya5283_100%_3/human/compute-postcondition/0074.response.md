Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(mdx, n)`.
   - The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `mdx`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - `t` is `t - 1` (this is a postcondition from the previous iteration, not directly relevant to the loop head).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - `i` is `mdx + 1`.
   - `res` is incremented by 1 if the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be within the range defined by `range(mdx, n)`.
   - Initially, `i` is set to `mdx + 1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at each iteration.
   - `mdx` remains constant for the duration of the loop.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value (`mdx + 1`).
- `mdx` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, `res` is incremented by 1 if the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, and `a` is a sorted list of integers.**
