Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `res` is `res + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input, and `mdx` is less than or equal to `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was initially set to 1 if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, otherwise it remained 0, the new value of `res` is now `res + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
