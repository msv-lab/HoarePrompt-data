Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `-1`, `res` contains the total count of elements in the list `a` starting from index `mdx` (which is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`) that are equal to `a[mdx]`**.

Explanation: The variable `t` is decremented by 1, so `t` is now `t - 1`. The other variables (`n`, `mdx`, `i`, and `res`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
