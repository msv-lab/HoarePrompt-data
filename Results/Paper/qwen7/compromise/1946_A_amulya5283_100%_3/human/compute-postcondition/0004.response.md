Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int type using `map(int, ...)`, and then converts the map object to a list. The original values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The new variable `a` is created and assigned the list of integers obtained from the input.
