Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an integer, and `n` is not equal to 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `res` is 0, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `mdx` as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. Since `n` is an integer and not equal to 1, `mdx` will be calculated based on the value of `n`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
