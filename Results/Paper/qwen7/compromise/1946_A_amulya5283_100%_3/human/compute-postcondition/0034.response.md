Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `res` contains the total count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` (excluding `a[mdx]` itself), `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. However, the values of `t`, `n`, `mdx`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged. The only change is that the list `a` is now sorted.
