Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `res` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input**.

The code `mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` simply reassigns the value of `mdx` based on the current value of `n`. Since `n` is an input integer, the exact value of `mdx` depends on the value of `n`. However, since no new information about `n` is provided, we keep it as "an input integer". The other variables (`t`, `i`, `res`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
