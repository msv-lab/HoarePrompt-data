Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `-1`, `res` is `0`, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.**

The code snippet only reassigns the value of `mdx` based on the current value of `n`. Since `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is recalculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `res`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
