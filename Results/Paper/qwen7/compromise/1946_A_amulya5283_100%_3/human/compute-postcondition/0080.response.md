Postcondition: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is either `-1` or `n - 1`, `res` contains the total count of elements in the list `a` starting from index `mdx` (which is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`) that are equal to `a[mdx]`, and `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user. If `n == 1`, `i` remains `-1`. Otherwise, `i` is set to `n - 1`, and `res` is incremented by 1 each time `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]` for every `i` in the range from `mdx` to `n-1`.
