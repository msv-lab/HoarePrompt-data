Output State: `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `res` is incremented by 1 for every occurrence where `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`, and `n` is an integer not equal to 1 with `mdx < n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `mdx` remains as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` will be set to `n - 1` (the last index of the list `a`), `res` will hold the total count of elements in `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` from index `mdx` to the end of the list, and `n` remains an integer not equal to 1 with the condition that `mdx < n`.
