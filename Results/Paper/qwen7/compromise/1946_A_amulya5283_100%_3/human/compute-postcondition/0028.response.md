Based on the initial state provided:

- `mdx` is defined as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
- `i` is set to `n - 1`.
- `res` is incremented by 1 for every occurrence where `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`.
- `n` is an integer not equal to 1 with `mdx < n`.

The `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`, which is the count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` (excluding `a[mdx]` itself).

To summarize:
- `mdx` is calculated once and does not change.
- `i` is set to `n - 1` and does not change during the loop.
- `res` is incremented each time an element in the list `a` at index `i` matches the element at index `mdx`.

Given these conditions, the output will be the count of elements in the list `a` that match `a[mdx]`, starting from `a[n-1]` down to `a[mdx+1]`.

Output: **res (where res is the count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` excluding `a[mdx]` itself)**
