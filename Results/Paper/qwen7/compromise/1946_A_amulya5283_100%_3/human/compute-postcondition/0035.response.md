Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `t` is set to 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
- `i` is set to `n - 1`.
- `res` is the count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` (excluding `a[mdx]` itself).
- `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input.

The `print(1)` statement simply outputs the integer 1. Since no other variables or their values are printed, the only thing that will be printed is the integer 1.
