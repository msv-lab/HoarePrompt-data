Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `res` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input, `mdx` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, and the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Initially, `res` is 0, so after executing this line, `res` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
