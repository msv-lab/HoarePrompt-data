### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

#### Problem Description:
We need to determine if we can transform an array into a sorted array using the operation of splitting any element that is at least 10 into its individual digits and inserting those digits back into the array.

#### Given Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

#### Function Summary:
- `func_1(lst)` returns `True` if `lst` is sorted in ascending order, otherwise `False`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` simply checks if the input list is sorted in ascending order. This part is correct and works as expected.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main loop iterates through the array and checks if the current element is greater than the previous element and greater than 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the current element into its individual digits and inserts them back into the array.
   - This logic is flawed because:
     - It only performs one split operation per iteration and does not continue to split the newly inserted digits.
     - It does not ensure that the array will eventually be sorted after all possible splits.
     - It does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed to sort the array.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
4
12 3 45 67
```

- Initial array: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
- After the first iteration (p=1):
  - `list1[p-1] = 12` and `list1[p] = 3`
  - Since `12 > 3` and `12 > 10`, it splits `12` into `[1, 2]`.
  - New array: `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`
- After the second iteration (p=2):
  - `list1[p-1] = 2` and `list1[p] = 3`
  - No split since `2 <= 3`.
- After the third iteration (p=3):
  - `list1[p-1] = 3` and `list1[p] = 45`
  - Since `3 < 45`, no split.
- After the fourth iteration (p=4):
  - `list1[p-1] = 45` and `list1[p] = 67`
  - Since `45 < 67`, no split.

The array remains `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, and `func_1` will return `False` because the array is not sorted.

This example shows that the program does not correctly handle the splitting process and does not ensure that the array will eventually be sorted.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
