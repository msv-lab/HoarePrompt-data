Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is either its original value (1) or `y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `results` list still contains 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `y` is `y - 1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y**.

Explanation: The line `max_sum = current_sum` updates the value of `max_sum` to be equal to the current value of `current_sum`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
