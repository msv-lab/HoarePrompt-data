Output State: The `results` list will contain the `best_y` value for each `x` in `test_cases` after the loop has executed all its iterations. For each `x`, `best_y` is the value of `y` (where 1 < y < x) that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` plus `y`. The `max_sum` variable will hold the highest value of `gcd_val + y` found for each `x`, but it will not be stored as it is overwritten in each iteration of the outer loop. `best_y` will be updated in each iteration of the outer loop to store the optimal `y` for the current `x`, and this value will be appended to the `results` list.

In summary, the `results` list will contain the optimal `y` values for each `x` in `test_cases`, ensuring that for every `x`, the corresponding `best_y` provides the maximum sum of `gcd(x, y) + y`.
