Output State: **`max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is now equal to `x-1`, `x` must be greater than 1, `y` is `x-1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`**

Explanation: The line `best_y = y` assigns the current value of `y` (which is `x-1`) to `best_y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
