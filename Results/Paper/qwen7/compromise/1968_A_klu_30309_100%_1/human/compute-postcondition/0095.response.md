Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (though `t` is not used in the function), a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers between 2 and 1000. It returns a list of `best_y` values, where each `best_y` is the largest integer less than the corresponding `x` in `test_cases` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `best_y` plus `best_y` is maximized.**
