Output State: **`max_sum` remains unchanged, `best_y` remains unchanged, `x` retains its original value, `y` is decremented by 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y-1`.**

This means that the `gcd_val` variable is now holding the greatest common divisor of the original value of `x` and the new value of `y` (which is `y` from the previous iteration minus 1). All other variables (`max_sum`, `best_y`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
