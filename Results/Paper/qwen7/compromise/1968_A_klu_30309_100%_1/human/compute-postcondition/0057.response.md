Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `gcd_val + y - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y - 2`, `best_y` is `y`, `results` list still contains 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y - 1`, `y` is `y - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is inside. All the variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
