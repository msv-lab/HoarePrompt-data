Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 2`, the `results` list now contains 1, `gcd_val` remains unchanged, `x` is the next value from `test_cases`, `y` is `x - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `x - 2`**.

Explanation: The line `best_y = y` assigns the current value of `y` (which is `x - 2`) to `best_y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
