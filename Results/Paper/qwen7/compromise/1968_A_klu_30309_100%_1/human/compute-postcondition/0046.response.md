Output State: **`max_sum` is the maximum value between its original value (0) and `current_sum`, `best_y` is either its original value (1) or `y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `results` list still contains 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `y` is `y - 1`**.

This means that the `gcd_val` variable has been assigned the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, while the other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
