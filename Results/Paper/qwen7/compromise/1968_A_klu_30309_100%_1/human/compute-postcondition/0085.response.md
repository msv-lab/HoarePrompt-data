Output State: **`max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 3`, the `results` list now contains 1, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 3)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement we are currently inside. The values of the variables `max_sum`, `best_y`, `results`, `gcd_val`, `x`, and `y` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
