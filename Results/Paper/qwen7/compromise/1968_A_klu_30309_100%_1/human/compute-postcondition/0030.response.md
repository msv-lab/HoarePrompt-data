Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `max_sum` will hold the highest value of `gcd_val + y` found during any iteration, where `y` ranges from `x-1` down to 1. The variable `best_y` will store the value of `y` that resulted in the highest `current_sum`. All other variables (`x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum`) will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes running, `max_sum` will contain the maximum sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` plus `y` for all `y` values from `x-1` down to 1. `best_y` will be the `y` value that gave us this maximum sum. The values of `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum` will be those from the last iteration of the loop.
