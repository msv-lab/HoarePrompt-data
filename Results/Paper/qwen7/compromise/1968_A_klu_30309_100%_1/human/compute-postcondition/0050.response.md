Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `y`, `results` list still contains 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `y` is `y - 1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the execution has broken out of the loop or conditional block. All other variables retain their previous values.
