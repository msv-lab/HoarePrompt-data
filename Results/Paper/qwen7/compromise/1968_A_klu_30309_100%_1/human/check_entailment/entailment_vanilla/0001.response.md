Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers from the input.
   - This part is handled correctly with `t = int(input())` followed by a list comprehension to read `t` integers into `test_cases`.

2. **Function Call:**
   - The program calls `func_1(t, test_cases)` to process the test cases and store the results in `results`.
   - The function `func_1` is defined and expected to handle the logic for finding the appropriate `y` for each `x`.

3. **Function Logic (`func_1`):**
   - The function initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - It iterates over each `x` in `test_cases`.
     - For each `x`, it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
     - It then iterates over `y` from `x-1` down to 1.
       - For each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using `math.gcd(x, y)`.
       - It computes the sum `current_sum = gcd_val + y`.
       - If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to `y`, then breaks out of the loop to avoid unnecessary checks.
     - After determining the best `y` for the current `x`, it appends `best_y` to `results`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program iterates over `results` and prints each value.

### Verification:
- The logic in `func_1` aims to find the `y` that maximizes the expression `gcd(x, y) + y` for each `x`.
- The approach of iterating from `x-1` down to 1 ensures that the first `y` that provides the maximum sum is found and used.
- The use of `break` after updating `best_y` ensures that no further unnecessary checks are performed once the optimal `y` is found.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the required `y` for each `x` and prints the results as specified.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
