Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the integer \( y \) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized for each test case. Here's a brief explanation:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and the values for each test case.
2. It defines a function `func_1` that iterates over each \( x \) from the test cases.
3. For each \( x \), it initializes variables to keep track of the maximum sum found so far (`max_sum`) and the corresponding \( y \) (`best_y`).
4. It then iterates over all possible \( y \) values from \( x-1 \) down to 1, calculating the gcd of \( x \) and \( y \), and checking if the sum of this gcd and \( y \) is greater than the current maximum sum.
5. If a higher sum is found, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to the current \( y \). Since the loop breaks after finding the first \( y \) that gives a higher sum, it ensures that the first such \( y \) is chosen.
6. Finally, it appends the best \( y \) found for each \( x \) to the results list and returns this list.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the logic seems sound and should produce the correct outputs for the provided examples.
