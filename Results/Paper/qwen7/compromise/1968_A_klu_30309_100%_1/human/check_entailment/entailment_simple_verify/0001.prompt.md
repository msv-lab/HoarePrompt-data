You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

    #State: Output State: The `results` list will contain the `best_y` values found for each `x` in `test_cases`. For each `x` in `test_cases`, `best_y` is the largest integer less than `x` such that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `best_y` plus `best_y` is maximized. The `max_sum` variable, which keeps track of the maximum sum found for each `x`, and the `best_y` variable, which stores the corresponding `y` value, will be updated accordingly within each iteration but will not affect the final state of the `results` list. The `gcd_val` variable will hold the GCD of the last `x` and `best_y` found for each `x` in `test_cases`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, the `results` list will contain the optimal `y` values (less than each `x`) for each `x` in `test_cases`, where the sum of the GCD of `x` and `y` plus `y` is maximized.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of best_y values, where each best_y is the largest integer less than the corresponding x in test_cases such that the sum of the GCD of x and best_y plus best_y is maximized.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers from the input.
   - This part is handled correctly with `t = int(input())` followed by a list comprehension to read `t` integers into `test_cases`.

2. **Function Call:**
   - The program calls `func_1(t, test_cases)` to process the test cases and store the results in `results`.
   - The function `func_1` is defined and expected to handle the logic for finding the appropriate `y` for each `x`.

3. **Function Logic (`func_1`):**
   - The function initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - It iterates over each `x` in `test_cases`.
     - For each `x`, it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
     - It then iterates over `y` from `x-1` down to 1.
       - For each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using `math.gcd(x, y)`.
       - It computes the sum `current_sum = gcd_val + y`.
       - If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to `y`, then breaks out of the loop to avoid unnecessary checks.
     - After determining the best `y` for the current `x`, it appends `best_y` to `results`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program iterates over `results` and prints each value.

### Verification:
- The logic in `func_1` aims to find the `y` that maximizes the expression `gcd(x, y) + y` for each `x`.
- The approach of iterating from `x-1` down to 1 ensures that the first `y` that provides the maximum sum is found and used.
- The use of `break` after updating `best_y` ensures that no further unnecessary checks are performed once the optimal `y` is found.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the required `y` for each `x` and prints the results as specified.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
