Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary where each key from 0 to n-1 (inclusive) corresponds to the maximum depth of nested parentheses up to that index in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `d.pop(n)` removes the entry with the key `n` from the dictionary `d`. Since the keys in `d` range from 0 to `n` (inclusive), removing the entry with the key `n` means that the dictionary now only contains keys from 0 to `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
