You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i's are distinct.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `wins` is between 0 and `k`, inclusive. `t` remains unchanged, and `k` remains unchanged. `a` remains unchanged.
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: k - 1 (where k is the initial value of wins)
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `wins` is between 0 and `k`, inclusive, `t` remains unchanged, and `k` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, and `wins` is less than `k`
    win_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        win_with_swap += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `wins` is now `wins` + 1, `t` remains unchanged, and `k` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `win_with_swap` is now the maximum of `win_with_swap` and `win_with_swap + 1` if the condition in the loop is never met, otherwise it is `win_with_swap + 1`.
    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
    #This is printed: max(wins, win_with_swap - (wins + 1) - 1 + (wins != 0)) (where `wins` is `wins + 1` and `win_with_swap` is updated based on the loop condition)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list 'a' of n integers within the constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 where all a_i's are distinct. It does not return any value (returns None).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
