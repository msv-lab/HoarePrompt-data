### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it correctly reads the number of cows `n` and the index of the cow `k`, followed by the ratings of all cows `a`.
3. **Initial Wins Calculation**: The program calculates the initial number of wins `wins` that cow `k` would have without any swaps. This is done by iterating through the ratings and counting how many ratings are less than `a[k-1]` until a larger rating is encountered.
4. **Check Without Swap**: If the initial wins `wins` are greater than or equal to `k`, the program prints `wins - 1`. This is because the cow cannot win more than `k-1` matches since it starts from position `k`.
5. **Wins With Swap**: If the initial wins are less than `k`, the program considers swapping the cow at position `k` with other cows to maximize the number of wins. It calculates `win_with_swap` by iterating from `win_with_swap` to `k-2` and counting how many ratings are less than `a[k-1]` until a larger rating is encountered.
6. **Max Wins Calculation**: The program then prints the maximum of `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating the initial wins and the wins with swap is correct.
- The conditions and calculations are handled appropriately.
- The program handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement.
