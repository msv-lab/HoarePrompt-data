You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i's are distinct.

    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: k - 1 (where k is the initial value of wins)
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `wins` is between 0 and `k`, inclusive, `t` remains unchanged, and `k` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, and `wins` is less than `k`
    win_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        win_with_swap += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `wins` is now `wins` + 1, `t` remains unchanged, and `k` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `win_with_swap` is now the maximum of `win_with_swap` and `win_with_swap + 1` if the condition in the loop is never met, otherwise it is `win_with_swap + 1`.
    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
    #This is printed: max(wins, win_with_swap - (wins + 1) - 1 + (wins != 0)) (where `wins` is `wins + 1` and `win_with_swap` is updated based on the loop condition)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` and finds the maximum number of elements in `a` that are greater than the `k-th` smallest element in `a`. If swapping the `k-th` smallest element with another element in the list increases the count of such elements, it considers this swap. The function then prints the maximum possible count of elements greater than the `k-th` smallest element, either before or after a potential swap, and returns `None`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it correctly reads the number of cows `n` and the index of the cow `k`, followed by the ratings of all cows `a`.
3. **Initial Wins Calculation**: The program calculates the initial number of wins `wins` that cow `k` would have without any swaps. This is done by iterating through the ratings and counting how many ratings are less than `a[k-1]` until a larger rating is encountered.
4. **Check Without Swap**: If the initial wins `wins` are greater than or equal to `k`, the program prints `wins - 1`. This is because the cow cannot win more than `k-1` matches since it starts from position `k`.
5. **Wins With Swap**: If the initial wins are less than `k`, the program considers swapping the cow at position `k` with other cows to maximize the number of wins. It calculates `win_with_swap` by iterating from `win_with_swap` to `k-2` and counting how many ratings are less than `a[k-1]` until a larger rating is encountered.
6. **Max Wins Calculation**: The program then prints the maximum of `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating the initial wins and the wins with swap is correct.
- The conditions and calculations are handled appropriately.
- The program handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
