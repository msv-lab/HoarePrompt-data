Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and \((-1)^i\) is equal to 1; `answer` now contains the element `array[a[0]]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `array[a[0]]` to the list `answer`. Since no other variables are affected, the values of `i`, `n`, and the condition \((-1)^i\) remain unchanged. The only new information is that `answer` now includes the element `array[a[0]]`.
