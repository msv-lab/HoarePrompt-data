Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be at least 2; `array[a[-1]]` is appended to `answer`; `a[-1]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `a` by 1. The other variables `i`, `n`, and `array[a[-1]]` appended to `answer` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
