Output State: **`k` is the input value of `k` decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to `n`, `answer` is a list containing the number 1 and the element at index -1 of `a`, `a` is a list containing [1, -1], `i` is an integer such that the power of -1 on `i` equals -1.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at the index specified by `a[-1]` (which is -1) of the list `array` to the list `answer`. Since `a` is `[1, -1]`, `a[-1]` is `-1`. Therefore, `answer` now contains the element at index `-1` of `array`, which is `n` (since `array` contains numbers from 1 to `n`). All other variables remain unchanged.
