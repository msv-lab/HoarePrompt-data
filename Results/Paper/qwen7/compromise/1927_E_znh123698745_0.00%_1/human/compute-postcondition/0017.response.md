Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `array` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `answer` has the element `array[a[-1] - 1]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of list `a` by 1. Since `a[-1]` was previously pointing to the last element of `a`, after decrementing, `a[-1]` now points to the second last element of `a`. Therefore, the new element appended to `answer` is `array[a[-1] - 1]`, which is `array[second last element of a - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
