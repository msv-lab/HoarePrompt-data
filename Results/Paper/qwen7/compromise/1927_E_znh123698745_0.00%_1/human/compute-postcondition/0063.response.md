Output State: **`k` is the input value of `k` decremented by 1, `n` is the input value of `n`.**

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. Since the initial state mentioned that `k` must be decremented by 1 for the next iteration, `k` is now the original value of `k` decremented by 1. The value of `n` is the second input provided by the user.
