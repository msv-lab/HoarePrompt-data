Output State: **`k` is the input value of k decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to n, `answer` is a list containing the number 1 and the first element of `array`, `a` is a list containing [1, -1]**.

Explanation: The code appends the first element of the list `array` (which contains numbers from 1 to n) to the list `answer`. Since `a[0]` is 1, `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends `array[1]` (the second element of the list `array`) to `answer`. Therefore, `answer` now contains the number 1 and the second element of `array`. All other variables remain unchanged.
