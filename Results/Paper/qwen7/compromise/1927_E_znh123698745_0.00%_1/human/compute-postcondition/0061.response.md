Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `array` is a list of integers.
   - `answer` is an empty list initially.
   - `n` is the length of the `array`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
   - For each `i`, the condition `(-1 < array[i] < array[i-1])` is checked.

3. **Condition Explanation**:
   - This condition checks if the current element `array[i]` is greater than `-1` and less than the previous element `array[i-1]`.
   - If this condition is true, the element `array[i]` is added to the `answer` list.

4. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `answer` will contain all elements from `array` that satisfy the condition `(-1 < array[i] < array[i-1])`.

5. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(*answer)` statement will print the elements of the `answer` list separated by spaces.

Given the above steps, the output will depend on the specific values in the `array`. Since the exact values of `array` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements that satisfy the condition.

Output: **elements that satisfy (-1 < array[i] < array[i-1]) for i from 1 to n-1**
