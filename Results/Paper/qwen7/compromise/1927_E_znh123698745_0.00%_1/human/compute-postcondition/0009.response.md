Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `answer` is the element at index `a[-2]` of `array`.**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of array `a` by 1. Since `answer` was previously the element at index `a[-1]`, it now corresponds to the element at index `a[-2]` after the decrement. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
