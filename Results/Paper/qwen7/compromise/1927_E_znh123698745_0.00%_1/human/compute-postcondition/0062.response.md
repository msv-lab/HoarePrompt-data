Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop is defined as: `for _ in range(int(input())):`
- This means the loop will run for a number of times equal to the integer input provided by the user.
- We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- No specific variables or their values are mentioned in the current state. However, we know that the loop just finished its execution for one iteration.

### Loop Head Analysis:
- The loop head is: `for _ in range(int(input()))`
- The loop variable `_` (which is typically an underscore when the loop variable is not used) is not relevant here since it is not being referenced.
- The key variable in the loop head is the number of iterations, which is determined by `int(input())`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Determine the Number of Iterations:**
   - The loop runs for a number of times equal to the integer input provided by the user.
   - Since no specific value is given for the input, let's denote the input value as `k`.

2. **Adjust the State:**
   - After the first iteration, the loop will run `k-1` more times.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the input value `k` will be decremented by 1.

### Conclusion:
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is the input value `k`, which will be reduced by 1 for the next iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **The integer input value `k` must be decremented by 1 for the next iteration.**

Since no specific variables like `answer` or `array` were mentioned in the current state, we focus on the loop control variable, which is the input value `k`.

If you need to express this in a more formal state format, it would look like:

State: **The integer input value `k` must be decremented by 1 for the next iteration.**
