Output State: **`answer` is a list containing the integer 1, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `a` with the values `[1, -1]`. This does not affect the values of `answer`, `t`, `n`, `k`, or `array`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
