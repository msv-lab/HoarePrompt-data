Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list named `array` which contains integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The values of `t` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
