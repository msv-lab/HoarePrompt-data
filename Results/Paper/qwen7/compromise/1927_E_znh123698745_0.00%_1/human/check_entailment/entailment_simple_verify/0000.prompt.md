You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `answer` will be a list containing all integers from 1 to `n-1`. The exact sequence of these integers depends on the parity of `n-1` and whether `(-1) ** i` evaluates to -1 or 1 for each iteration. If `n-1` is odd, the sequence will start with the first element of `array` and alternate between decrementing and incrementing indices. If `n-1` is even, the sequence will start with the second element of `array` and follow a similar alternating pattern. The final state of `a` will be either `[1, -1]` or `[2, -1]`, depending on the last operation performed during the loop.
    #
    #In summary, `answer` will contain a permutation of the first `n-1` natural numbers, and `a` will be adjusted according to the loop's operations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not generate a k-level permutation for all possible inputs. Specifically, consider the following case:

For \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 2 \):

- The program generates the sequence `[1, -1, 1, -1]` after adjusting the indices, which translates to `[1, 4, 2, 3]` after mapping back to the range `1` to `4`.

However, this sequence is not k-level because the sums of the continuous segments of length \( k \) (which is 2 in this case) are:
- \( 1 + 4 = 5 \)
- \( 4 + 2 = 6 \)
- \( 2 + 3 = 5 \)

The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is \( 6 - 5 = 1 \), which satisfies the condition. However, the issue arises when considering other permutations and larger values of \( n \) and \( k \). The program's logic does not ensure that the sums of all continuous segments of length \( k \) will differ by no more than 1.

To illustrate further, consider \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 4 \):

- The generated sequence might look like `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`, which translates to `[1, 10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7, 5, 6]`.

The sums of the continuous segments of length 4 are:
- \( 1 + 10 + 2 + 9 = 22 \)
- \( 10 + 2 + 9 + 3 = 24 \)
- \( 2 + 9 + 3 + 8 = 22 \)
- \( 9 + 3 + 8 + 4 = 24 \)
- \( 3 + 8 + 4 + 7 = 22 \)
- \( 8 + 4 + 7 + 5 = 24 \)
- \( 4 + 7 + 5 + 6 = 22 \)

Here, the maximum sum is 24 and the minimum sum is 22, resulting in a difference of 2, which violates the k-level condition.

Therefore, the program does not guarantee a k-level permutation for all inputs, making it incorrect.
