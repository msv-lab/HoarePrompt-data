Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head condition is `high >= cur`.

2. **Determine the current values of the variables**:
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `low` is updated to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is updated to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `cur` is set to `low`.

3. **Check the condition `high >= cur`**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

4. **Analyze the values of `high` and `cur`**:
   - Since `cur` is set to `low`, and `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` will be one of these two values.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, so `high` will be the larger of these two values.

5. **Ensure the condition `high >= cur` holds true**:
   - Given that `cur` is the minimum and `high` is the maximum, the condition `high >= cur` will always be true as long as both `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are valid integers.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - There is no need to adjust any state because the condition `high >= cur` is inherently satisfied based on the definitions of `low` and `high`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is updated to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is updated to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is set to `low`**
