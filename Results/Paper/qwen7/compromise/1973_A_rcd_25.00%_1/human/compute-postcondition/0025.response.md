To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition and see what variables affect it. The loop condition is `high >= cur`.

Let's break down the relevant variables and their roles:

- `high`: This is compared against `cur` in the loop condition.
- `cur`: This is updated within the loop body but starts with an initial value derived from `low` and possibly incremented by 1.

Given the loop condition `high >= cur`, for the loop to execute one more time, `cur` must be less than or equal to `high`. Since `cur` is initially set based on `low` and potentially incremented by 1, and given that `high` is greater than or equal to `low`, the key adjustment needed is ensuring that `cur` is still within the range where it can be less than or equal to `high`.

Since the loop condition depends directly on `high` and `cur`, and `cur` is derived from `low` (which itself is derived from `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`), the critical state to adjust is `cur`. However, since `cur` is derived from `low` and `low` is derived from `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, we need to ensure that the values of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are such that `cur` remains valid.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are those that influence `cur` and `high`. Specifically, we need to ensure that `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are correctly set and that `cur` remains valid.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, with the additional condition that `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 < p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 > p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`, `cur` must be less than or equal to `high`**
