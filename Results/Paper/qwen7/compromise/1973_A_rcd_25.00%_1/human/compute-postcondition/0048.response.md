Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is set to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is set to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is set to `low`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `low` to `cur`. Since `low` is already defined as the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` now holds the same value as `low`. All other variables remain unchanged.
