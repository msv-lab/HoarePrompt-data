Let's analyze the given loop and the conditions step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `high >= cur`.
2. **Variables Involved in the Loop Condition**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `high` and `cur`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `low` is set to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is set to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` is set to `low`.
- If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `high >= cur` must hold true. Therefore, we need to ensure that `high` is still greater than or equal to `cur`.

Given that `cur` is initially set to `low` and can only increment by 1, the only way the loop can continue is if `high` is greater than or equal to `cur` at the start of the next iteration.

Thus, we need to ensure that `high` remains greater than or equal to `cur` for the loop to execute one more time.

**State:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is set to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is set to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is set to `low`. Additionally, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur` for the loop to execute one more time.**
