Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `low`, `high`, and `cur` are as calculated in the previous iteration.
- `p1` is the first integer input.
- `p2` is the second integer input.
- `p3` is the third integer input.

The code snippet simply prints `-1`.

Since no specific values for `low`, `high`, `cur`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are required to determine the output of the print statement, and the print statement itself does not reference any of these variables, the output is straightforward.

Output: **-1**
