Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `high`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `high >= cur`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
   - `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 < p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 > p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`.
   - `cur` is equal to `low`.

4. **Adjust the state of `high` and `cur`**:
   - Since `cur` is equal to `low`, we need to ensure that `high >= low` for the loop to execute the first time.

Given the conditions:
- `low` is defined based on the comparison between `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- We need to ensure that `high` is at least as large as `low`.

Since the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not specified, we cannot determine their exact values, but we know that `high` should be at least equal to `low` for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `high` must be greater than or equal to `low`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, with the additional condition that `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 < p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 > p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`, `cur` is equal to `low`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `low`**.
