Output State: **Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. We continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining part of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no changes are made to the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, their values remain as they were in the initial state. The postcondition remains unchanged, and the loop continues.
