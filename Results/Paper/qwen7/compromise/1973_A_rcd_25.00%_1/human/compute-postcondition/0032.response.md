Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
   - `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 < p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 > p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(p1 - cur + p3)
   ```

To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the expression `p1 - cur + p3`:

- `p1` and `p3` are directly provided by the input.
- `cur` is not explicitly defined, but it must be such that `high >= cur + 1`.

From the conditions:
- Since `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, we know `p3 < p1 + p2`.
- `low` and `high` are derived from comparing `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. Given that `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, one of these differences must be smaller and the other larger.
- `high` is the larger difference and must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`.

Given these conditions, the exact value of `cur` is not specified, but we know it must satisfy `high >= cur + 1`. Therefore, the value of `p1 - cur + p3` depends on the specific values of `p1`, `p3`, and `cur`.

However, without knowing the exact values of `p1`, `p3`, and `cur`, we can only describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1, p3 are integers from the input and cur is an integer such that high >= cur + 1)**
