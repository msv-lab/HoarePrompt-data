Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, with the additional condition that `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 < p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 > p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`, `cur` is equal to `low`, and `high` is greater than or equal to `low`. The current value of `(p1 - cur)` is less than or equal to the current value of `(p2 - (p3 - cur))`.
