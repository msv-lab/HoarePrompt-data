Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low`, `high`, and `cur` retain their values from the previous iteration, `p1` is the first integer input, `p2` is the second integer input, `p3` is the third integer input.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and splits them using the `split()` method, then converts them into integers using `map(int, ...)`. These integers are assigned to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The conditions about `t`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
