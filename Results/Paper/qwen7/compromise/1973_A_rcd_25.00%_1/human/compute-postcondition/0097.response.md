To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `high >= cur`.

Let's break down the relevant states and their conditions:

1. **`high`**: The loop continues as long as `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`.
2. **`cur`**: This variable is updated within the loop based on the comparison between `low` and `high`, and it can be incremented.

Given the current state:
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `low` is updated to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is updated to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` is set to either `low` or `high` depending on whether `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
- `cur` is increased by 1 if it was set to `high`.
- `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur - 1`.

For the loop to continue, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`. Since `cur` can change during each iteration, the key is to ensure that `high` remains greater than or equal to `cur` at the start of the next iteration.

### Analysis:
- **`t`**: This state does not affect the loop condition `high >= cur`, so no adjustment is needed.
- **`p1`, `p2`, `p3`**: These values are determined by the input and do not change within the loop, so no adjustment is needed.
- **`low` and `high`**: These values are updated within the loop but do not directly affect the loop condition `high >= cur`.
- **`cur`**: This value changes within the loop and can be incremented. For the loop to continue, `high` must be greater than or equal to the new value of `cur`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `high` is greater than or equal to the new value of `cur` at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is updated to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is updated to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is set to either `low` or `high` depending on whether `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, `cur` is increased by 1 if it was set to `high`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`**.
