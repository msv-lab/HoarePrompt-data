Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then `p3` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, and `low` is set to `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is less than `p3 - p2`, otherwise `low` is `p3 - p2`.
   - Similarly, `high` is set to `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is greater than `p3 - p2`, otherwise `high` is `p3 - p2`.
   - In both cases, `cur` equals `high`.

2. **Loop Head**: 
   - The loop is controlled by the variable `t`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: 
   - The loop will execute as long as `t > 0`.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `t`. Since `t` is decremented by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1 (since it is decremented by 1).

**Final State**:
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remains odd.
- `low`, `high`, and `cur` also remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `low`, `high`, and `cur` are as calculated in the previous iteration.**
