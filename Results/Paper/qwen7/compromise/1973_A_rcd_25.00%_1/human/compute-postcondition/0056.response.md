Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is set to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is set to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is set to `low` + 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by 1. Since `cur` was previously set to the value of `low`, it now holds the value of `low + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given conditions.
