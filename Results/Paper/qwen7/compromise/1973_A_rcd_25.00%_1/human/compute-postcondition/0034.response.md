Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 < p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 > p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`; `cur` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions. The condition that `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1` still holds true.
