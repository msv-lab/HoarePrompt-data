Let's break down the problem step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `low` is updated to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is updated to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `cur` is set to either `low` or `high` depending on whether `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
   - `cur` is increased by 1 if it was set to `high`.
   - `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

2. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input, their exact values depend on the input. However, we know that their sum is odd.
   - `low` and `high` are derived from the differences `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
     - If `p3 - p1` < `p3 - p2`, then `low = p3 - p1` and `high = p3 - p2`.
     - Otherwise, `low = p3 - p2` and `high = p3 - p1`.
   - `cur` is set to either `low` or `high` based on the condition `p1 - cur` â‰¤ `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
   - If `cur` is set to `high`, it is increased by 1.

3. **Final Expression:**
   - We need to evaluate `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - Given the conditions, `cur` will be one of the values derived from `low` and `high`, and it might have been incremented by 1 if it was initially set to `high`.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - Let's consider the possible values of `cur`:
     - If `cur` is set to `low` and not incremented, then `p1 - cur + p3` would be `p1 - (p3 - p1) + p3 = 2 * p1 - p3 + p3 = 2 * p1`.
     - If `cur` is set to `high` and then incremented, then `cur` becomes `high + 1`, so `p1 - cur + p3` would be `p1 - (high + 1) + p3 = p1 - (p3 - p2 + 1) + p3 = p1 + p2 - 1`.

Given the conditions and the nature of the problem, the exact value of `cur` depends on the specific input values, but we can express the final result in terms of the input values.

Output: **p1 + p2 - 1 (if cur was set to high and incremented, otherwise 2 * p1)**
