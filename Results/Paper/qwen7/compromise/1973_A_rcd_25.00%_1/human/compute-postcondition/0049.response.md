Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `high` and `cur`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `high >= cur`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `low` is set to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is set to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `cur` is set to `low`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

Given the current state, `cur` is already set to `low`, and `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. Therefore, `cur` is always less than or equal to `high`. However, we need to ensure that `high` is greater than or equal to `cur` for the loop to start.

Since `cur` is already defined and cannot be changed directly, the only thing we need to ensure is that `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`. Given the definitions of `low` and `high`, this condition is inherently satisfied unless `high` is explicitly set to a value less than `cur`, which is not the case here.

Therefore, no additional state adjustment is needed beyond what is already given.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is set to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is set to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is set to `low`.**
