The function processes `t` test cases, where for each case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. It checks if the sum of these integers is even. If not, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. After processing all test cases, it ensures that `t` is reduced to `0`, indicating all inputs have been processed.
