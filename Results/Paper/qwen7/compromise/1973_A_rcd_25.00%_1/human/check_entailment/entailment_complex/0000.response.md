Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
3. The program checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If not, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case, which is correct because the sum of points must be even for the scores to be achievable.
4. If the sum is even, the program attempts to calculate the maximum number of draws. This involves checking if `p3` can be achieved given the constraints of the game rules.
5. The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws seems to be flawed. Specifically, the condition `if p3 >= p1 + p2:` is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of draws. Instead, it should check if the total points can be distributed in a way that maximizes the number of draws.
6. The current implementation does not correctly handle the case where the scores are achievable but the number of draws cannot be determined accurately.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
