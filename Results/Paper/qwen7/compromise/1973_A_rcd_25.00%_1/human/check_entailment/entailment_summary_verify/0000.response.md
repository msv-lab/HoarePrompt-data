### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the function summary step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function processes `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
- It checks if the sum of these integers is even. If not, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.
- Otherwise, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Sum Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 == 0`. This ensures that the total points are even, which is necessary for the scores to be achievable through a series of games.

2. **Case 1: `p3 >= p1 + p2`**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2`.
   - This part of the logic is incorrect. As explained in the original assessment, this does not necessarily give the maximum number of draws. For example, in the case `1 1 2`, the program prints `2`, but the correct answer should be `2` (as explained in the example).

3. **Case 2: `p3 < p1 + p2`**:
   - The program uses binary search to find the maximum number of draws.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` based on the differences between `p3` and `p1` and `p2`.
   - It iteratively checks if the current number of draws (`cur`) is feasible by ensuring `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
   - If feasible, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If not feasible, it increments `cur` and continues the search.
   - If no valid `cur` is found, it prints `p3`.

#### Example Walkthrough:
- Consider the input `1 1 2`:
  - `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, `p3 = 2`.
  - Sum check: `(1 + 1 + 2) % 2 == 0` is true.
  - Case 2 applies since `2 < 1 + 1`.
  - `low = min(2 - 1, 2 - 1) = 1`, `high = max(2 - 1, 2 - 1) = 1`.
  - `cur = 1`:
    - `p1 - 1 = 0 <= p2 - (2 - 1) = 0` is true.
    - Prints `p1 - 1 + p3 = 1 - 1 + 2 = 2`.

This output is incorrect because the correct answer should be `2` (two draws: one between Player 1 and Player 2, and one between Player 1 and Player 3).

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. It fails to account for the possibility of multiple draws among different pairs of players. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
