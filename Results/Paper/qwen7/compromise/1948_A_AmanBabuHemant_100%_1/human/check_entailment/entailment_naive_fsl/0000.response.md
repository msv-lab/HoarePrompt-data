Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `n` is odd. According to the problem description, if `n` is odd, the output should be "NO". However, the program prints "NO" only when `n % 2` is true, which is incorrect. For example, if `n = 5`, the program will incorrectly print a string instead of "NO". This violates the problem description.
