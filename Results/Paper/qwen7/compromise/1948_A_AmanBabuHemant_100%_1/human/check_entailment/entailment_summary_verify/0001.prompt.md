You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving an integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 50 \)). For each \( n \), it checks if \( n \) is odd or even. If \( n \) is odd, it prints "NO". If \( n \) is even, it constructs a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated \( \frac{n}{2} \) times. If the constructed string length is less than 200 characters, it prints "YES" followed by the string; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the value of `n` for each case.

2. **Special Character Condition**:
   - The problem states that a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The program checks if `n` is odd using `if n % 2`. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each character can only be special if it has exactly one neighbor of the same character.

3. **String Construction**:
   - For even `n`, the program constructs a string `s` using the pattern `'AAB' * (n // 2)`.
   - This pattern ensures that every third character is different from its neighbors, making the other two characters special.
   - The program then checks if the constructed string `s` is less than 200 characters long. If so, it prints "YES" followed by the constructed string. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is odd correctly by printing "NO".
   - However, the program does not handle the case where `n` is even but the constructed string exceeds 200 characters. In such cases, the program incorrectly prints "NO", which is not always true since strings up to 200 characters can still satisfy the conditions for some values of `n`.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 6`
  - Constructed string: `AAB AAB`
  - Length: 6 (valid)
  - Output: `YES\nAAB AAB` (correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 1`
  - Since `n` is odd, output: `NO` (correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 2`
  - Constructed string: `AAB`
  - Length: 3 (invalid, should be checked against 200, but the program doesn't handle this correctly)
  - Output: `NO` (incorrect, should be `YES\nMM`)

### Conclusion:

The program fails to handle the case where the constructed string exceeds 200 characters but still satisfies the condition for being a valid solution. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
