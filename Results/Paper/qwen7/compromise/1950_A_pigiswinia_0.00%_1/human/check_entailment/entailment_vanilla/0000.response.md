### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Reading Test Case Input**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - It checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIRS' if this condition is true.
   - It checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is true.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'NONE'.
4. **Output Format**: The program outputs the results in the correct format as specified in the problem statement.

Given that the logic implemented in the function matches the problem requirements exactly, there are no errors in the provided code.

### Correctness:
**True**
