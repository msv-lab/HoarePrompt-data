The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the range 0 to 9, and an integer \(t\) indicating the number of test cases (with \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)). For each test case, it prints either 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the relative values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
