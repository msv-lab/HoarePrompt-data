Output State: The output state will consist of 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the input values provided. Specifically, for each input triplet (a, b, c), the output will be 'STAIRS' if a < b < c, 'PEAK' if a < b > c, and 'NONE' otherwise. The exact sequence of these outputs depends on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
