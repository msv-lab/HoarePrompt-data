Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- `n` is greater than 0 but its exact value is not specified.
- `cntl[j]` is explicitly stated to have a value less than or equal to 1.
- The condition `c` is either false or `j` is equal to `n`.

The `print(j)` statement will simply print the value of `j`.

Output: **1**
