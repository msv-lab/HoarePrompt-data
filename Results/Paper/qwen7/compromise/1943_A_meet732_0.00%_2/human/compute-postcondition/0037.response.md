Output State: **`j` is 2, `cntl[2]` is less than or equal to 0**

Explanation: The variable `c` is decremented by 1, changing its value from whatever it was (assuming it was initialized similarly to `j` or had a related initial value) to `c - 1`. However, since the initial state only mentions `j` and `cntl[2]`, and does not specify `c`, we can only update `j` which is directly affected by the code. The condition `cntl[2]` being less than or equal to 0 remains unchanged as no operation affects it.
