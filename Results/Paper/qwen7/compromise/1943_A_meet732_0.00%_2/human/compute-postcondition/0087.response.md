Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `j` will be equal to `n`, `c` will be 0, and `cntl[j]` will be less than 2 for all `j` from 1 to `n`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `j` will have the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has gone through all the iterations up to `n`. The variable `c` will be 0, which implies that it was decremented to 0 during the loop's execution. Additionally, for every index `j` from 1 to `n`, the value of `cntl[j]` will be less than 2, as each element in `cntl` was incremented based on the integers in `a` and the condition in the loop ensured that `cntl[j]` does not exceed 2. If `cntl[j]` ever reached 2, the loop would have broken earlier.
