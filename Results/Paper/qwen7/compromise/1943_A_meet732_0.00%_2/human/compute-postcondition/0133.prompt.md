Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `c` is 2 if `cntl[0]` is less than or equal to 2, otherwise `c` is `cntl[0]`; the list `a` remains unchanged, all elements in `cntl` corresponding to indices present in `a` are updated to reflect the count of each element in `a`, and all other elements in `cntl` remain as 0. Additionally, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        c -= 1
        if not c or j == n:
            print(j)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `cntl[j]` is less than or equal to 1, and if `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2 and `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is falsy (i.e., `c` is 0) or `j` equals `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 3, if the condition `cntl[j] < 2` is true and either `not c` is true or `j == n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
