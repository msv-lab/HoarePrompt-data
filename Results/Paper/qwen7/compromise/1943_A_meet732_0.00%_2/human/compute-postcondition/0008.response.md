Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is the second element of the list `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is 0 except `cntl[i]` which is now 2.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in a:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the second element of `a`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the third element of `a`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - `i` needs to be updated to the third element of `a`.
   - `cntl` needs to be updated such that `cntl[i]` (where `i` is now the third element of `a`) is set to 1 (since it was 2 before, and the loop will increment it).

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` is now the third element of `a`.
   - `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is 0 except `cntl[i]` which is now 3 (since it was 2 and the loop increments it by 1).

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`i` is the third element of the list `a`, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is 0 except `cntl[i]` which is now 3**
