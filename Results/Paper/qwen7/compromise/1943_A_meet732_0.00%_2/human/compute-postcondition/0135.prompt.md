Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in a:
        cntl[i] += 1
    if cntl[0] == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        c = min(2, cntl[0])
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                c -= 1
                if not c or j == n:
                    print(j)
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The list `cntl` will have each element set to the count of how many times the corresponding index appears in the list `a`. Specifically, if the value `i` appears `x` times in the list `a`, then `cntl[i]` will be `x`. All other elements in `cntl` will remain 0. Additionally, if `cntl[0]` is equal to 0, the function does nothing. Otherwise, the loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of `j` is 2. The variable `c` is 0, and `cntl[2]` is less than or equal to 0. The loop has broken out due to the condition `not c or j == n` being true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The list `cntl` will show the frequency of each number in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` was 0, then for each integer `i` in `a`, the corresponding index `i` in `cntl` will be incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `i` in `a`. The loop will terminate when `a` is empty or `j` equals `n`. If the `if` condition is not met, then after the loop, `j` will be equal to `n`, `c` will be 0, and `cntl[j]` will be less than 2 for all `j` from 1 to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: For each index `i` present in the list `a`, the value at `cntl[i]` will be equal to the number of times `i` appears in `a`. All other elements in `cntl` (those indices not present in `a`) will remain as 0. The list `a` will remain unchanged from its initial state. Additionally, if `cntl[0] == 0`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, after the loop executes all iterations, `j` will be equal to `n`, `c` will be 0, and `cntl[j]` will be 0 for all indices in `cntl` that were incremented during the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
