Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `i` is the second element of `a`, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, `cntl[i]` is now `cntl[i] + 1`**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1, where `i` is the second element of `a`. Since `i` is the second element of `a`, the value of `cntl[i]` is now one more than its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
