Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `j` is 2 and `c` is decreased by 1. The postcondition states that if `c` is falsy (i.e., `c` is 0) or `j` equals `n`, the loop breaks.

4. **Determine the next value of `j`**: Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `2 + 1 = 3`.

5. **Check the loop continuation condition**: For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n + 1`. Given that `j` is now 3, the loop will continue only if `n` is greater than 3.

6. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `j` is set to 3 and `n` is greater than 3 for the loop to execute one more time. The value of `c` does not affect the loop continuation directly but should still reflect its current state.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
