Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `j` will be equal to `n`, `c` will be 0, and `cntl[j]` will be 0 for all indices in `cntl` that were incremented during the loop.**

Explanation: The loop continues to decrement `c` and increment `j` until `c` becomes 0 or `j` reaches `n`. Given that the loop executed 3 times, it implies that `j` reached a value such that either `c` became 0 or `j` equaled `n`. Since the loop broke when `c` was falsy or `j` equaled `n`, and considering the loop ran exactly 3 times, `c` must have been decremented to 0 before `j` reached `n`. Therefore, `j` will be equal to `n` and `c` will be 0. All elements in `cntl` that were incremented during the loop will be set to 0 because the loop condition `cntl[j] < 2` would no longer be met once `j` reaches its maximum value.
