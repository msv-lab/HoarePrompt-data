Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `cntl[j]` is less than 2
   - Either `c` is False or `j` equals `n`
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.
   - Given that `j` is currently 1, the next value of `j` will be 2.

4. **Conditions for Continuing the Loop:**
   - `n` must be at least 1 (this condition remains unchanged).
   - `cntl[j]` must be less than 2. Since `j` is now 2, we need to check `cntl[2]`.
   - The condition `either c is False or j equals n` needs to be checked again with `j` being 2.

5. **Postconditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be at least 1.
   - `cntl[2]` must be less than 2.
   - Either `c` is False or `j` (which is now 2) equals `n`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be at least 1, `cntl[2]` is less than 2, and either `c` is False or `j` (which is 2) equals `n`**.
