Reasoning:
1. The provided function aims to solve the problem by determining the optimal moves for Alice and Bob to achieve the desired MEX value.
2. The function correctly initializes a frequency count (`cntl`) for the elements in the list `a`.
3. It then iterates through the frequency counts to determine the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the list `a` more than once (excluding zero).
4. The logic to determine the MEX value is sound:
   - If `cntl[0]` is 0, it means there is no zero in the list, so the MEX is 0.
   - Otherwise, it checks for the smallest integer `j` (starting from 1) that appears fewer than 2 times in the list.
5. The function correctly handles all edge cases as per the problem statement:
   - If no such `j` exists (all numbers appear at least twice), the MEX would be `n`, but since `j` is checked up to `n`, it will correctly identify the smallest such `j`.

Given the above reasoning, the function correctly implements the logic to find the optimal MEX value for the given game scenario.

Correctness: **True**
