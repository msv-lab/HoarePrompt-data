Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the maximum difference in the x-coordinates and the maximum difference in the y-coordinates will be equal, representing the side length of the square. The program computes the side length by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates), squares this value, and prints it. This approach works for all given test cases and any valid set of coordinates for a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Therefore, the program is correct.
