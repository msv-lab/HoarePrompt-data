Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. It reads four pairs of coordinates for each test case.

2. **Coordinate Extraction**: For each test case, the program extracts the x-coordinates into a list `x`.

3. **Side Length Calculation**: The side length of the square is correctly calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`). Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined solely from the x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, but the program only uses x-coordinates).

4. **Area Calculation**: The area of the square is correctly computed as `dx * dx`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the area for each test case, which matches the problem statement.

Given that the program follows the correct logic and handles all aspects of the problem as described, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
