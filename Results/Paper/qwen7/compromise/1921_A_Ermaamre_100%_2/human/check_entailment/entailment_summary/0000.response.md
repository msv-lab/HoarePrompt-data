Reasoning: 
The provided program correctly identifies the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the given points. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference in the x-coordinates will be equal to the side length of the square. Similarly, the difference in the y-coordinates would also give the same side length. However, the program only uses the x-coordinates to calculate the side length, which is sufficient because the area of the square is the side length squared.

Given that the problem guarantees that the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the approach of using the x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) alone is valid. The program correctly calculates the area by squaring the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
