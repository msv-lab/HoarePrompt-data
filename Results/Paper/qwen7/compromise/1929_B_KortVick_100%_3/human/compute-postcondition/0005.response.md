Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it checks if \( 4n - 2 \) equals \( k \). If true, it prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \); otherwise, it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). The function reads these test cases from standard input and outputs the results to standard output, with the number of outputs equal to the value of \( t \), which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.**
