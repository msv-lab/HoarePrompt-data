Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `a` with `n` elements, all initialized to 0. This does not affect the values of `n` or `x`. Therefore, `n` remains an input integer, and `x` remains a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. The new list `a` is initialized with `n` zeros.
