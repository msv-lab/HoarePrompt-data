Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`, ..., `a[n-1]` is the sum of `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`, and the new input integer is one less than before.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specified that `n` is an input integer greater than 1, the new value of `n` is one less than the original value. All other variables (`i`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
