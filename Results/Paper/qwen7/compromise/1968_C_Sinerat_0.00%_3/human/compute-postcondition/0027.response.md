Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`, ..., `a[n-1]` is the sum of `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The list `a` will have been updated such that each element from index 1 to `n-1` will hold the cumulative sum of the corresponding elements from the list `x` up to that point. Specifically, `a[1]` will be `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` will be `a[1] + x[1]`, and so on until `a[n-1]`, which will be `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.
