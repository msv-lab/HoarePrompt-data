Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the start of the loop**: 
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`.
   - `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` starts at 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer greater than 1.
   - The values of `a[1]` and `a[2]` are derived from the loop and do not change within the loop itself.

5. **Formulate the new state**: 
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
   - `n` remains an input integer greater than 1.
   - `a[1]` and `a[2]` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`**
