Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of `n` zeros**.

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was an input integer greater than 1. The list `x` also remains unchanged as it was previously defined as a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string. The new list `a` is created and filled with `n` zeros.
