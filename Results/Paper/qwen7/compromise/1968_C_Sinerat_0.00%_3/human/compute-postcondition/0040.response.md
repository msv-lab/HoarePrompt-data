Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 3, `a[i]` is `a[n-1]` which equals to `500 + sum(x[0:n-1])`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. The value of `a[i]` (specifically `a[n-1]`) will be the initial value of `a[0]` (which is `500`) plus the sum of all elements in the list `x` from index `0` to `n-2`. This is because each iteration updates `a[i]` to be the previous value of `a[i-1]` plus `x[i-1]`.
