Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [0] * n
    a[0] = 500
    for i in range(1, n):
        a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
    print(*a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `n` must be greater than 1; `a[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of the list `x`, starting with `a[0] = 500`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will contain `n` elements where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of the list `x`. The first element `a[0]` is initialized to 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` is calculated as `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`, ..., `a[n-1]` is the sum of `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The list `a` will have been updated such that each element from index 1 to `n-1` will hold the cumulative sum of the corresponding elements from the list `x` up to that point. Specifically, `a[1]` will be `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` will be `a[1] + x[1]`, and so on until `a[n-1]`, which will be `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a[i]` is equal to `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`, and all elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1` are computed as per the loop, starting from `a[0] = 500` and each subsequent element `a[i]` is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the user-input list `x`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the list `a` will have been updated such that each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is the cumulative sum of the initial value 500 and the first `i+1` elements of the list `x`. The variable `i` will have the final value of `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
