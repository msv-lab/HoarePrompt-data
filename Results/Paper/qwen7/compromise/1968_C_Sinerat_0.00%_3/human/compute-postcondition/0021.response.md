Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1
   - `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be updated to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer greater than 1.
   - The value of `a[1]` does not change within the loop head, so it remains `a[0] + x[0]`.

5. **Formulate the new state**: Based on the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1
   - `a[1]` is still `a[0] + x[0]`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`**
