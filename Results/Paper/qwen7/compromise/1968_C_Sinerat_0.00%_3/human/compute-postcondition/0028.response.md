Based on the initial state described:

- `i` is equal to `n`, where `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- The list `a` is initialized such that:
  - `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`
  - `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`
  - ...
  - `a[n-1]` is `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`

Given this, let's break down the values of the elements in the list `a`:

- `a[0]` is not explicitly defined, but it is used in the calculation of subsequent elements.
- For `a[1]`, it is `a[0] + x[0]`.
- For `a[2]`, it is `a[1] + x[1] = (a[0] + x[0]) + x[1]`.
- Continuing this pattern, `a[n-1]` is the cumulative sum of `a[0]` and the first `n-1` elements of the list `x`.

Therefore, the list `a` after the loop will contain:
- `a[0]` (which remains unchanged as no operation is performed on it).
- `a[1]` = `a[0] + x[0]`
- `a[2]` = `a[1] + x[1] = a[0] + x[0] + x[1]`
- ...
- `a[n-1]` = `a[n-2] + x[n-2] = a[0] + (x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2])`

When the `print(*a)` statement is executed, it will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **a[0] a[0] + x[0] a[0] + x[0] + x[1] ... a[0] + (x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2])**
