Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer. Since the initial state required `n` to be greater than 1, the new value of `n` must also be greater than 1 after the code execution. The other variables remain unaffected, so the only updated information is that `n` is now an integer input that is greater than 1.
