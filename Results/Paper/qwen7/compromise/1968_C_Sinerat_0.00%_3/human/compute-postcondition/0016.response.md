Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and then converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `x`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was only defined in the initial state and no further operations were performed on it.
