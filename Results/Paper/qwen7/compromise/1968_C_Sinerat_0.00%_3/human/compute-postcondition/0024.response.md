Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1
   - `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`
   - `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making `i` equal to 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 3) must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must remain greater than 3.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be updated to 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 3.
   - The values of `a[1]` and `a[2]` do not change because they are outside the loop head and not directly affected by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`**
