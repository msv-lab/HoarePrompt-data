Output State: `trumps` is a list of ranks (strings), `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is the input string from `input()`, `answers` is a list of strings, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to None. The `trumps` list contains all ranks of cards that match the trump suit. For each non-trump suit that appears more than once, there is an entry in `answers` showing the sorted ranks of that suit followed by the suit itself. All other suits in `suits` are set to None.
