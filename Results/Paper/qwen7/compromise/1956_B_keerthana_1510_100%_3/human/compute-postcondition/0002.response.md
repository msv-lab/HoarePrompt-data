Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and for each test case, the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents the integers on the cards in your hand, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice. After executing the loop, the value of t remains unchanged, and for each test case, the output is the count of duplicate integers in the input line.

The loop processes every second line starting from the third line of the input file (skipping the first two lines). For each processed line, it calculates the number of duplicate tokens (integers) by comparing the length of the split tokens list with the length of the set of those tokens. The result for each line is printed but does not affect the input state.
