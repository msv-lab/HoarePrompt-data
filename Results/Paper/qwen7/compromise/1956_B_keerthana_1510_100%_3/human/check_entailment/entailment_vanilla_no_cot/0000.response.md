Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the function `func()` is flawed and does not follow the rules of the game as described. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the difference between the number of tokens and the number of unique tokens in each line, which is not relevant to the game's scoring mechanism.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game based on the given constraints and the optimal strategy for Nene. Hereâ€™s a more appropriate approach:

1. Count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
2. Simulate the game by considering Nene's optimal moves to minimize your score.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_points(n, cards):
    # Count the occurrences of each card in your hand
    card_count = {}
    for card in cards:
        if card in card_count:
            card_count[card] += 1
        else:
            card_count[card] = 1
    
    # Sort the cards in descending order of their counts
    sorted_cards = sorted(card_count.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    
    # Initialize Nene's score
    nene_score = 0
    
    # Simulate the game
    for _ in range(n):
        # Nene will always pick the card that maximizes her score
        # and minimizes yours. We assume she picks the highest count card
        # that is not yet on the table.
        
        # Find the highest count card that is not yet on the table
        for card, count in sorted_cards:
            if count > 0:
                # Nene picks the card
                nene_score += 1
                # You pick the same card
                card_count[card] -= 1
                break
    
    return nene_score

def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        cards = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        
        result = n - max_points(n, cards)
        results.append(str(result))
    
    print('\n'.join(results))

func()
```

This corrected program reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the maximum number of points you can get by simulating the game and considering Nene's optimal moves.
