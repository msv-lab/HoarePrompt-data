### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Counting**: For each string in the test case, the program counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'.
3. **Comparison and Output**: After counting, it compares the counts of 'A' and 'B' and prints the character that appears more frequently.

Let's break down the steps:

- The program initializes two counters `ac` and `bc` to zero.
- It then iterates through each character in the input string, incrementing the appropriate counter (`ac` for 'A' and `bc` for 'B').
- Finally, it compares the two counters and prints the character with the higher count.

Given the problem constraints and the example provided, this logic should work correctly for all valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, it is correct.

**Correctness: True**
