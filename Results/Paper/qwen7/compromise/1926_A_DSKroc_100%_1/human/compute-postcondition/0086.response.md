Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is the last character of `s`.
- `ac` is the total number of 'A's in `s`.
- `bc` is the total number of characters in `s` minus the number of 'A's.
- The condition `ac > bc` is true.

The print statement is simply `print('A')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'A'`, regardless of the values of the other variables, the output will be:

Output: **A**
