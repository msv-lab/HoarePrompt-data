Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    ac = 0
    bc = 0
    s = input()
    for i in s:
        if i == 'A':
            ac += 1
        else:
            bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `q` is 0, `ac` is equal to the total number of 'A' characters in the string `s`, `bc` is equal to the total number of 'B' characters in the string `s`, and `s` is an empty string, with the condition that `ac` is either greater than `bc` or less than or equal to `bc`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `q` is 1, `ac` is a non-negative integer representing the count of 'A' in the original string `s`, `bc` is a non-negative integer representing the count of 'B' in the original string `s`, and `s` is an empty string. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, then `ac` is greater than `bc`; otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the last character of `s`, `ac` is equal to the total number of 'A's in `s`, and `bc` is equal to the total number of characters in `s` minus the number of 'A's. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, then the condition is true. Otherwise, the number of 'A's (`ac`) is less than or equal to the number of other characters (`bc`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
