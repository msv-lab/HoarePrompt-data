Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `q` is 0, `ac` is `ac + 2`, `bc` is either `1` or `0`, `s` is a non-empty input string, and `i` is the next character in the string `s`.**

Explanation: The value of `ac` is incremented by 1, making it `ac + 2` since `ac` was initially either `ac + 1` or `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
