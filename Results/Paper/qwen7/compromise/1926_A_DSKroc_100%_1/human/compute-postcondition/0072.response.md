Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in s:`. The variables involved here are `i` (the iterator) and `s` (the string).

2. **Understand the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a non-empty string. If the first character of `s` is 'A', then `ac` is 1; otherwise, `bc` is 1.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` is the current character being iterated over in the string `s`.
   - For the loop to continue, `s` must still be a non-empty string, and the condition regarding `ac` and `bc` should be considered for the new first character of `s`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is the current character being iterated, it will be the second character of `s` in the next iteration.
   - `s` must remain a non-empty string.
   - The condition for `ac` or `bc` will be based on the new first character of `s`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `s` remains a non-empty string.
- The first character of `s` will determine whether `ac` or `bc` is set to 1.

Since `i` is the current character, in the next iteration, `i` will be the second character of `s`. Therefore, the first character of `s` will be the character that was previously stored in `i`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `s` is a non-empty string, if the second character of `s` is 'A', then `ac` is 1. Otherwise, `bc` is 1.**
