Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is 0.
- `n` is less than or equal to 0.
- `s` is calculated as `p[s] - n`.
- `sp` is increased by `a[s]` `n` times.
- `bp` is increased by `a[b]` `n` times.
- `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration.
- `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration.
- `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

Given that `n` is less than or equal to 0, and considering the operations performed on `sp` and `bp`, if `n` is 0, then `sp` and `bp` remain unchanged because increasing a value 0 times does not change it. If `n` is negative, it still doesn't change the values of `sp` and `bp` since adding a negative number zero times also results in no change.

Therefore, `sp` and `bp` will retain their initial values (which are not explicitly provided but are irrelevant for this specific print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print('Draw')
```

Output: **Draw**
