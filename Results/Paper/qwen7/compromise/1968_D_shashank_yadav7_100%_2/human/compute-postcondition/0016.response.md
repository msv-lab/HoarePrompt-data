Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` to `p[b] - 1`. Since `k` remains 0 regardless of the condition, the initial state of `k` being 0 is preserved. The value of `n` is also unchanged as it was initially stated to be greater than 1.
