Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `bm` is max(`bm`, `a[b] * 0 + bp`), `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] * k + sp`.**

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. Since `k` is 0, `a[s] * k` is 0, so `sp` is updated to `a[s] + sp`. All other variables remain unchanged.
