Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `i` is 2, `k` has been decreased by 1 (though the new value of `k` is not relevant to the final output state), `b` is `p[b] - 1`, and now `s` is assigned the value of `p[s] - 1`. The variable `s` has been updated according to the code, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
