Output State: **`k` is decreased by 1; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is `p[s] - 2`; `sp` is increased by `a[s]`; `bp` is increased by `a[b]`; `i` is `i + 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `bm` is the maximum between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`; `sm` is the maximum between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`**

Explanation:
- `k` is decreased by 1.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `p[s] - 2`.
- `sp` is increased by `a[s]`.
- `bp` is increased by `a[b]`.
- `i` is increased by 1.
- `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`.
- `bm` is updated to the maximum between its current value and `a[b] * k + bp`.
- `sm` is updated to the maximum between its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`.
