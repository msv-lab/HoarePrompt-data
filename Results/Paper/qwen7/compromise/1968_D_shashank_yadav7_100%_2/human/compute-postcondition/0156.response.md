Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is 0.
- `n` is less than or equal to 0.
- `s` is calculated as `p[s] - n`.
- `sp` is increased by `a[s]` `n` times.
- `bp` is increased by `a[b]` `n` times.
- `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration.
- `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration.
- `bm` is greater than `sm`.

Given that `n` is less than or equal to 0, both `sp` and `bp` will not change because increasing a value by another value that is less than or equal to 0 does not alter the original value. Therefore, `sp` and `bp` will remain their initial values.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string "Bodya" without any variables being interpolated into it.

Output: **Bodya**
