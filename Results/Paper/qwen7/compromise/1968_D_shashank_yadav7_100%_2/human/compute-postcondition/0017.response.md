Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`**

Explanation: The code `s = p[s] - 1` updates the value of `s` to `p[s] - 1`. The initial state of `b` is given as `p[b] - 1`, which means `b` already holds the value of `p[b] - 1`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
