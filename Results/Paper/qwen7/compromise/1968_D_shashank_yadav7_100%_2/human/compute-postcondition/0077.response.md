Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is decreased by 1, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`**.

This means that the value of `k` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables retain their previous conditions and values.
