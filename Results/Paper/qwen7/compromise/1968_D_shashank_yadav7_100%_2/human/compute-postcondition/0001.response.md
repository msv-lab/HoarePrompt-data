Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `t`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: According to the given state, `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(t)` will execute if `t` is at least 1.

Given that `t` is an input integer and the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = t - 1`, the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
