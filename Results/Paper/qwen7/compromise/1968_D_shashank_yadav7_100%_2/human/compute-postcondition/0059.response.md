Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is 1, `b` is `input integer - 1`, `s` is an input integer, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

The value of `b` is decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The initial values and conditions for `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `p`, and `a` are preserved.
