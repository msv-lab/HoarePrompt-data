Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `b = p[b] - 1` updates the value of `b` to be `p[b] - 1`. The initial state of `n`, `i`, and `k` remains unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and `k` is 0 still holds true.
