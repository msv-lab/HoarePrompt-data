Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b -= 1
    s -= 1
    sp = a[s]
    bp = a[b]
    bm = a[b] * k
    sm = a[s] * k
    for i in range(n):
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            break
        b = p[b] - 1
        s = p[s] - 1
        bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
        sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
        sp += a[s]
        bp += a[b]
    if bm > sm:
        print('Bodya')
    elif bm < sm:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1` repeated `n` times, `s` is `p[s] - 1` repeated `n` times, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` remains as the maximum value. Otherwise, `bm` equals `sm`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `k` is 0, `bm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop, `s` is the result of `p[s] - 1` after the last iteration, `sm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop, `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` after the last iteration, `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` after the last iteration, `b` is the result of `p[b] - 1` after the last iteration. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` remains the maximum value it achieved during any iteration, and if `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`, then `sm` remains the maximum value it achieved during any iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `k` is 0, `n` is less than or equal to 0, `s` is `p[s] - n`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]` `n` times, `bp` is increased by `a[b]` `n` times, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration, and `bm` equals `sm` regardless of whether `bm` is initially greater or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
