Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is decreased by 1, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b] + a[b]`, and `b` is `p[b] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increments `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `bp` is updated to its previous value plus `a[b]` twice (since `+=` means adding `a[b]` to the current value of `bp`).
