Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is 1, `b` is `input integer - 1`, `s` is `input integer - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `sp` is now equal to `a[s]`**.

The code updates `sp` to be equal to `a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
