Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly simulate the game for all possible scenarios. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the scores and positions of Bodya and Sasha. Let's consider a specific case to demonstrate the issue:

### Example Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 2 3 2
  4 1 2 3
  7 2 5 6
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - Bodya starts at position 3.
  - Sasha starts at position 2.
  - After the first turn:
    - Bodya's score: \(a_3 = 5\).
    - Bodya moves to position 3 → 2 → 1.
    - Sasha's score: \(a_2 = 2\).
    - Sasha moves to position 2 → 1.
  - After the second turn:
    - Bodya's score: \(5 + a_1 = 5 + 7 = 12\).
    - Bodya moves to position 1 → 4 → 3.
    - Sasha's score: \(2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9\).
    - Sasha moves to position 1 → 4.
  - Final scores:
    - Bodya: 12
    - Sasha: 9

- **Actual Output:**
  - The program incorrectly calculates the final scores and positions, leading to an incorrect result.

### Issue in the Program:
- The program incorrectly updates the scores and positions. It does not properly handle the scenario where a player might stay at their current position or move to the new position based on the permutation.
- The program uses a single loop to simulate multiple turns, which leads to incorrect score calculations and positions.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly simulate each turn for both players, ensuring that they can either stay at their current position or move to the new position based on the permutation. This requires nested loops to handle each turn separately for both players.

Since the provided program does not correctly simulate the game for all possible scenarios, the correctness is **False**.
