Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. The function `func_1` attempts to count the frequency of elements in the array and then prints the first element that appears exactly once or whose frequency is zero. However, this does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for both players to maximize and minimize the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the optimal moves for both players. Given the constraints and the nature of the game, the solution should focus on ensuring that Alice can always achieve a specific MEX value by strategically choosing elements, while Bob tries to prevent this.

Here is a more accurate approach to solving the problem:

```python
def optimal_game_score(n, arr):
    freq = [0] * n
    for num in arr:
        freq[num] += 1
    
    mex = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if freq[i] % 2 == 1:
            mex = i + 1
            break
    
    return mex

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(optimal_game_score(n, arr))
```

This solution works as follows:
1. Count the frequency of each number in the array.
2. Determine the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear an odd number of times in the array. This will be the MEX of the array `c` if both players play optimally.

This approach ensures that Alice can always achieve the desired MEX value, and Bob cannot prevent it from being achieved.
