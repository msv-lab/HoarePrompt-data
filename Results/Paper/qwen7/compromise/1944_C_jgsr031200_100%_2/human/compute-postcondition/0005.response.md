Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n + 1):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - From the given state before the loop starts, we know that `cou` is 0.
   - We also know that `freq` is a list where each index `i` (where \(0 \le i < n\)) contains the count of how many times `i` appears in the original list `arr`. All other elements in `freq` up to index `n` are still zeros.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop `for i in range(n + 1)` will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop starts at `i = 0` and goes up to `i = n`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop depends on the value of `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1.
   - The initial value of `i` in the loop will be 0, as the loop starts at `i = 0`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0 at the start of the loop.

**Final State:**
State: **`cou` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
