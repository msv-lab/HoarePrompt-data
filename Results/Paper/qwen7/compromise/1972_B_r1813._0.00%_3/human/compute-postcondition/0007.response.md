Output State: `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[2]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", `index` is `2 + 2 * t`, `results` is a list of 'YES' and 'NO' based on whether the count of 'U' in each string `s` is odd or even respectively after all iterations of the loop.
