Postcondition: **`m` is `n - 2 * k`, and either `m` equals `1` and `i` equals `k`, or `m` is greater than or equal to `k - 2`, `i` is `k + 2`, and `dp` is a list with `m + 1` elements where `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, and for each index `i` from `3` to `m`, `dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.**

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes. If `m` equals `1`, then `i` equals `k` and no further changes occur. Otherwise, `m` is at least `k - 2`, `i` is incremented to `k + 2`, and the list `dp` is populated according to the specified recurrence relation.
