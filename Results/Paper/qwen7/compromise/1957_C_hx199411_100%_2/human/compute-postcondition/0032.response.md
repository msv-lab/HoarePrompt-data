Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is defined as `n - 2 * k` and equals `1`. This means `n - 2 * k = 1`.
- `i` is equal to `k`.
- `k` remains an input integer.
- `c` and `r` are the last integers entered as input during the loop's final iteration.
- `num` is the sum of `2` added `k` times (which is `2 * k`) plus the additional value added during each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r`.

Given the print statement `print(1)`, it directly outputs the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
