Output State: **`m` is an integer, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` remains an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split, `num` is either 2 or 1, `t` is `False`, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**

Explanation: The value of `num` is incremented by 1. Since `num` was initially either 1 or 2, after incrementing, it will now be either 2 or 1 (depending on its original value). All other variables remain unchanged.
