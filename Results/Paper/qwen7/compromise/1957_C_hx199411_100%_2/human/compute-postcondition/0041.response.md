Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is being iterated over the range from 3 to `m + 1`.
   - Other variables mentioned are `m`, `k`, and `dp`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is `n - 2 * k` and must be greater than or equal to `k - 2`.
   - `i` is `k` and must be at least `3`.
   - `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop starts from `3` and goes up to `m + 1`, the next value of `i` would be `k + 1` if the loop continues.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be updated to `k + 1`.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is determined by `n` and `k` which are external to the loop.
   - `dp[i]` needs to be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

4. **Update the Conditions:**
   - The condition `m` must be greater than or equal to `k - 2` remains the same.
   - `i` must now be at least `4` because it will start from `k + 1` if `k` was at least `3`.

5. **Final State:**
   - `m` remains the same.
   - `i` is updated to `k + 1`.
   - `dp[i]` is not explicitly stated to change but needs to be recalculated based on the new `i`.

Given this analysis, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`m` is `n - 2 * k` and must be greater than or equal to `k - 2`, `i` is `k + 1` and must be at least `4`, `dp[i]` is not explicitly stated but needs to be recalculated based on the new `i`**.

However, since the exact value of `dp[i]` is not needed for the state adjustment, we focus on the necessary variables and their conditions:

State: **`m` is `n - 2 * k` and must be greater than or equal to `k - 2`, `i` is `k + 1` and must be at least `4`**.
