Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2, `k` is an input integer, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, `c` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input split by space, `r` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input split by space.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input separated by a space and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The values of `i`, `k`, `c`, and `r` are updated accordingly. The initial values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
