Output State: `m` is `n - 2 * k` and must be greater than or equal to `k - 2`, `i` is `k + 2`, `dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` for `i` ranging from `3` to `m`, and `dp` is a list with `m + 1` elements, all initialized to `0`, with `dp[1]` set to `1` and `dp[2]` set to `3`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `m` will still be `n - 2 * k` (as long as it is greater than or equal to `k - 2`), `i` will be `k + 2` (since the loop increments `i` by `1` each time and runs until `i` reaches `m + 1`), and `dp` will contain values computed according to the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` for each index from `3` to `m`. The initial conditions `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` remain unchanged.
