Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(3, m + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `m`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` is `n - 2 * k` and must be greater than or equal to `k - 2`.
   - `i` is `k + 1` and must be at least `4`.
   - `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `m + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k + 1` and `m` is `n - 2 * k`.
   - Since `i` must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, `i` will become `k + 2`.

4. **Check the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < m + 1`.
   - Therefore, `k + 2` must be less than `m + 1`, which means `m` must be at least `k + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `m` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` becomes `k + 2`.
   - `dp[i]` will be updated based on the new value of `i`, but since we are only asked to adjust the states at the start of the next iteration, we don't need to update `dp[i]` here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `m` is `n - 2 * k` and must be greater than or equal to `k - 2`, `i` is `k + 2` and must be at least `5`, `dp[i]` is undefined.**
