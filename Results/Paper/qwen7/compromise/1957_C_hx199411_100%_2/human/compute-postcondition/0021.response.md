Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `k` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `num` is `c` + 2 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is `c` + 3**

Explanation: The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial conditions:
- If `c` equals `r`, then `num` was initially `c + 1`. After incrementing, `num` becomes `c + 2`.
- If `c` does not equal `r`, then `num` was initially `c + 2`. After incrementing, `num` becomes `c + 3`.

All other variables (`i`, `k`, `c`, `r`) remain unchanged.
