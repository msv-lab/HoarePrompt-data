Output State: The final state of `dp` will be a list of length `m + 1` where each element `dp[i]` is computed as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` for all `i` from 3 to `m`. The initial conditions are `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, and `dp[i] = 0` for all other indices up to `m`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `dp` list will contain values calculated according to the given formula, starting from the third index up to `m`, with the specified modulo operation to ensure the values stay within a certain range.
