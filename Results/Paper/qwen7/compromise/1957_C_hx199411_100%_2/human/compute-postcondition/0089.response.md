Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` must be less than or equal to `k`, `c` is the first integer from the input split during the final iteration, `r` is the second integer from the input split during the final iteration, `num` is the total sum of 1s and 2s added during all iterations, `t` is `False`, `m` is an integer equal to `n` - `num`.**

Explanation: The line `dp[1] = 1` sets the first element of the list `dp` to 1. All other elements remain 0 as specified in the initial state. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `c`, `r`, `num`, `t`, and `m`) are not affected by this line of code.
