Output State: **`m` is `n - 2 * k`, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` remains an input integer, `c` and `r` are the last integers entered as input during the loop's final iteration, and `num` is the sum of `2` added `k` times (which is `2 * k`) plus the additional value added during each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r`. `dp` is a list with `m + 1` elements, all initialized to `0`, and `m` is not equal to `1`.**

The code initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to `0`. This does not affect the values of `m`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, or `num`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions except for the new list `dp` being created.
