Output State: **`m` is an integer equal to `n` - `num`, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split during the final iteration, `r` is the second integer from the input split during the final iteration, `num` is either 1 or 2, `t` is `False`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` and `r` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively, `i` is less than `k`, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of the integers split from the input.**

In this case, the code takes two integers as input and splits them into `c` and `r`. The values of `m`, `i`, `k`, `num`, `t`, `n`, `c`, `r`, and their relationships remain unchanged except for the assignment of `c` and `r` with the respective integers from the input.
