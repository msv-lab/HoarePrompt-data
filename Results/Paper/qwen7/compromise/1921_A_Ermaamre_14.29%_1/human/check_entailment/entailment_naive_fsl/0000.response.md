Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to identify pairs of points that share the same x-coordinate to determine the side length of the square. However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for all possible configurations of the square's corners. Specifically, the program only checks three out of the six possible pairs of points that could share the same x or y coordinate. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
1 1
2 2
-1 -1
-2 -2
```

In this case, the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, but the program will not correctly identify the side length. The program only checks the pairs (1, 2), (1, -1), and (2, -2), none of which directly provide the side length of the square. Therefore, the program will not work for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
