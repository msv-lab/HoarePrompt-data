Reasoning:
1. The program correctly identifies the side length of the square by comparing the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the given points.
2. It handles the different possible configurations of the square's corners by checking the x-coordinates and y-coordinates in three possible scenarios.
3. The program calculates the absolute difference between the relevant coordinates to find the side length of the square.
4. Finally, it squares the side length to get the area and prints it.

However, there is a potential issue with the logic for determining the side length. The program assumes that the first pair of coordinates it encounters with matching x-coordinates or y-coordinates will always be a valid side of the square. This might not be the case if the input order is such that the valid sides are not encountered first.

To ensure correctness, we should consider all possible pairs of points to identify the valid sides of the square. Here is an improved version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Find the unique x and y coordinates
        x_coords = set([p[0] for p in points])
        y_coords = set([p[1] for p in points])
        
        # Identify the side length by finding the differences between the unique coordinates
        side_length = None
        for x in x_coords:
            for y in y_coords:
                for p in points:
                    if p[0] == x and p[1] == y:
                        if side_length is None:
                            side_length = 0
                        side_length += 1
        
        # Calculate the area
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)
```

Given the current logic and the execution summary, the original program does not cover all possible configurations and may produce incorrect results in some cases. Therefore, the original program is not fully correct.

Correctness: **False**
