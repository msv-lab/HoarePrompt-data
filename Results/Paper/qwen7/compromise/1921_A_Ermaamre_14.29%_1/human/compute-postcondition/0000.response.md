Output State: **a is an input integer.**

The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. Since the input is a series of test cases, each containing four lines with pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, the first line of each test case provides the value for `a`. All other initial conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
