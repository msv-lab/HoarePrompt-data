Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; `a` is a sorted list where each element is (num - 1) for each num in the original list `a`; `present` is a set containing all elements from the list `a` minus one; `ans` is x - 2.**

The variable `ans` is assigned the value `x - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
