Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be 0 initially because `len(nums) - 2` is the upper limit.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `i` must be 0 for the loop to start executing, we need to set `i` to 0.
   - The value of `t` and `N` do not directly affect the loop condition, so they remain as given.
   - The value of `cd` is irrelevant to the loop condition, so it remains as given.
   - The state of `nums` does not change within the loop head, so it remains as given.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`cd` is 0, `i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `nums` is a list with an additional element 0 inserted at the beginning, and the rest of the list remains unchanged**.
