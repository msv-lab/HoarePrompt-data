Postcondition: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the input string `s`, and `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character, or -1 if all characters in `s` are the same. In this case, `x` is not equal to -1. The function `func_1` returns False when applied to the substring starting from `s[x + 1]`.**
