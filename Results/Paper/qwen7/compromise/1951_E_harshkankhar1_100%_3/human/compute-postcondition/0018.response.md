Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character, or -1 if all characters in `s` are the same. Given that `x` is not equal to -1, there must be at least one character in `s` that does not match the first character.
- The function `func_1` returns `False` when applied to the substring starting from `s[x + 1]`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the print statement:

1. `s[:x + 1]`: This is a substring of `s` that includes all characters from the start of `s` up to and including the character at index `x`.
2. `s[x + 1:]`: This is a substring of `s` that starts from the character at index `x + 1` to the end of the string.

Since `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character, `s[:x + 1]` will include all characters from the start of `s` up to and including the first differing character. The substring `s[x + 1:]` will include all characters from the next differing character onwards.

Therefore, the print statement will output two substrings separated by a space: the first substring includes all characters up to the first differing character, and the second substring includes all characters from the next differing character onwards.

Output: **s[:x + 1] s[x + 1:]**
