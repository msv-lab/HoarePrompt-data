Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character, or -1 if all characters in `s` are the same. Given that `x` is not equal to -1, it means there is at least one character in `s` that does not match the first character.
   - `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, meaning the substring starting from `s[x + 1]` to the end of the string satisfies some condition specified by `func_1`.
   - `x` is neither equal to 1 nor equal to half the length of `s`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
   ```

Given these conditions, let's analyze what will be printed:

- `s[:x + 2]` will include the substring from the start of `s` up to and including the character at index `x + 1`.
- `s[x + 2:]` will include the substring starting from the character at index `x + 2` to the end of `s`.

Since `x` is the index of the first character that does not match the first character, and `x` is neither 1 nor half the length of `s`, we need to consider a few cases:

- If `x` is 0, then the first character does not match itself, which contradicts the condition that `x` is not -1.
- If `x` is greater than 0 and less than `n/2`, then `s[:x + 2]` will include the first character, the character at index `x`, and the character at index `x + 1`.
- If `x` is close to the end of the string, `s[x + 2:]` will be a non-empty substring starting from `x + 2` to the end of `s`.

Given that `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, it implies that the substring starting from `x + 1` to the end of `s` meets some condition. This doesn't affect the slicing but confirms the validity of the substring starting from `x + 1`.

Therefore, the output will be the concatenation of the substring from the start of `s` up to and including the character at index `x + 1`, followed by a space, and then the substring starting from `x + 2` to the end of `s`.

Output: **s[:x + 2] s[x + 2:]**
