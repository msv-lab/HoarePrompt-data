### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to check if a given string can be partitioned into substrings such that none of these substrings are palindromes.
   - If the entire string is a palindrome, we should return "NO".
   - If the string is not a palindrome, we should return "YES" with the partition details.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code has two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` checks if a string is a palindrome.
   - `func_2` processes each test case and tries to find a valid partition.

3. **Key Points in `func_2`**:
   - It checks if the first character of the string is different from the rest. If so, it prints "YES" and the partition.
   - If the first character is the same as the rest, it checks if the substring starting from the second character is a palindrome.
   - Depending on the results, it prints "YES" or "NO".

4. **Issues Identified**:
   - The function only handles simple cases where the first character is different or the substring starting from the second character is a palindrome.
   - It does not handle more complex cases where the string might have multiple non-palindromic segments.
   - It does not account for all possible valid partitions when the string is not a single palindrome.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The provided solution does not cover all edge cases and does not guarantee finding a valid partition for all non-palindromic strings.
   - For example, it fails to handle strings like "aab" which can be partitioned into "a" and "b".

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It fails to handle all cases where a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

**Correctness: **False**
