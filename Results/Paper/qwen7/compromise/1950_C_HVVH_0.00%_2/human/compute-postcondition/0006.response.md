Functionality: **The function processes `n` time inputs in the format `h:m`, converting them to a 12-hour clock format with AM/PM designations. It prints each adjusted time. After processing, the function does not return any value but modifies the `day` variable to reflect the final AM/PM designation from one of the processed times and retains the input integer `n` as the number of iterations completed.**
