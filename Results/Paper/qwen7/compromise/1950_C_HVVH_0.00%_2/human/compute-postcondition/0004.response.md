Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `day` could be either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is an input integer after all iterations of the loop.

Explanation: The loop processes `n` time inputs in the format `h:m`, adjusting the hour based on whether it's AM or PM, and then prints the adjusted time along with the corresponding AM/PM designation. The initial value of `t` and `day` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. After the loop completes, `day` will reflect the final AM/PM designation from one of the processed times, and `n` will be the number of iterations completed, which is an input integer.
