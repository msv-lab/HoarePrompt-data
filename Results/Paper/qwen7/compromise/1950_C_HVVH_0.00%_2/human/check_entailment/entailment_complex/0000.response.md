Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the function splits the input string `s` into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
3. The function correctly handles the conversion of hours from 24-hour format to 12-hour format:
   - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, it sets `day` to 'PM'. However, there is an unnecessary check if `h` equals 12, which can be removed as setting `day` to 'PM' already covers this case.
4. The function prints the adjusted time in the format `hh:mm` followed by the appropriate AM/PM designation.
5. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly, which matches the problem statement requirements.

Based on the above analysis, the function correctly converts the given 24-hour format times to 12-hour format with the correct AM/PM designations.

Correctness: **True**
