Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
2. The logic for determining whether it's AM or PM is correct:
   - If the hour `h` is 0, it converts to 12 AM.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 to convert to the 12-hour format and sets `day` to PM.
   - For other cases, it sets `day` to PM, and specifically checks if `h` is 12 to switch between AM and PM.
3. The program uses f-strings to format the output correctly, ensuring that both hours and minutes have two digits.
4. However, there is an issue with how the `day` variable is being used. The `day` variable is updated after each iteration, which means the last time's AM/PM designation will be used for all outputs. This is not correct because each time should have its own AM/PM designation.
5. Despite this, the program still prints the correct 12-hour format for each input, as the `day` variable is only used once per loop to set the initial AM/PM for that specific time.

Given these points, the program technically produces the correct output for each test case, but it incorrectly updates the `day` variable for all subsequent times.

Correctness: **False**
