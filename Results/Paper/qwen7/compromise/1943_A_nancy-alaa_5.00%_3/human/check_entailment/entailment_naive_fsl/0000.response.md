Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a`. Instead, it simply checks the presence of each integer from 0 to `n-1` in the array `arr` and prints the first missing integer, which does not reflect the game's rules.

For instance, consider the following test case:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
```

According to the game rules:
1. Alice picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and removes it from `a`.
2. Bob picks an element from `a`, and removes it from `a`.

A possible optimal game could be:
1. Alice picks 0, so `a = [0, 1]` and `c = [0]`.
2. Bob picks 0, so `a = [1]` and `c = [0]`.
3. Alice picks 1, so `a = []` and `c = [0, 1]`.

The MEX of `[0, 1]` is 2. However, the program will incorrectly output 0 because it simply checks the presence of integers from 0 to `n-1` in the array without simulating the turns of Alice and Bob.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game's logic and thus is incorrect.
