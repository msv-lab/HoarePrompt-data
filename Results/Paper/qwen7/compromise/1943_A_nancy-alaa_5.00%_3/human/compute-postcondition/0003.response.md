Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.**

The code creates a `Counter` object named `mpp` which counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
