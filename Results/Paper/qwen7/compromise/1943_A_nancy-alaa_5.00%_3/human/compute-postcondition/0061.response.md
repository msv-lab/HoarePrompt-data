Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `False`
- `i` is `0`
- `n` is greater than `0`
- If the current value of `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement
- `mpp[i]` equals `1`
- `first` remains `True`

The code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

Given that `i` is initially set to `0` and the condition `mpp[i]` equals `1` is satisfied (since `i` is `0` and `mpp[0]` is `1`), the loop or if statement does not break, and the value of `i` remains `0`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `i`, which is `0`.

Output: **0**
