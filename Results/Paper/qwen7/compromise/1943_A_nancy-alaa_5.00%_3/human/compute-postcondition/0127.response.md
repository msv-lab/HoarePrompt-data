Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is defined as `i + 1`. This means that `i` is being set to a value that is one more than its current value. However, since the initial value of `i` is not explicitly stated, we need to consider the context. Typically, if `i` is not initialized, it might be considered as 0 or undefined in many programming contexts. But for the sake of this problem, let's assume `i` was previously set to some value, say `k`, then after `i = k + 1`, `i` would be `k + 1`.

- `n` is an integer equal to the input integer. This means `n` holds the value of the input integer.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(i)
```

Since the question asks us to determine exactly what will be printed and we know that `i` is `i + 1`, we can infer that `i` must have been set to some value before this line of code. Without loss of generality, if we assume `i` was initially set to 0 (a common default), then after executing `i = i + 1`, `i` becomes 1.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
