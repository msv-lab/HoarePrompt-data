Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `False`
- `i` is `0`
- `n` must be greater than `0`
- The current value of `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`

The code snippet to be executed is:

```python
print(i)
```

Here, `i` is explicitly stated to be `0` in the initial state. Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `i`.

Output: **0**
