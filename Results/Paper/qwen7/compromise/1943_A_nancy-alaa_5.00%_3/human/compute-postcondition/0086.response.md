Based on the initial state provided, the variables and their states are as follows:

- `first` is a boolean, but its value is not specified.
- `i` is an integer, and its value is `(i+1)`, implying that `i` starts from 0.
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

Since the value of `i` is explicitly stated as `(i+1)`, and considering `i` starts from 0, the value of `i` will be 1.

Output: **1**
