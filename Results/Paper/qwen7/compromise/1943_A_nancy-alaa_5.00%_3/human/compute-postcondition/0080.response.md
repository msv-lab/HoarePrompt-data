Postcondition: `first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer (i+1), `n` is an integer greater than 0. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If these conditions are not met, the values of `first`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
