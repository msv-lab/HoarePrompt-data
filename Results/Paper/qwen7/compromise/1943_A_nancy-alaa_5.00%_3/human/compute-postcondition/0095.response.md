Output State: **`first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer equal to `n`, `n` is an integer equal to the input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which is a positive integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`first` and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `i` is still equal to the initial value of `n`, which is now also the value of the input.
