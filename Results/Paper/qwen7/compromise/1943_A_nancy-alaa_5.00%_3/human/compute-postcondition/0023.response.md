Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `first` remains False
   - `i` is either 0 or the next key in `mpp` where `mpp[key] == 1`
   - `n` must be greater than 0

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If the current value of `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, no changes are made to `i` and `first` remains as is.
   - If `mpp[i]` is equal to 1 and `first` is False, `i` is set to the next key in `mpp` where `mpp[key] == 1`.

4. **Determine the New State:**
   - Since the loop runs from `i` to `n-1`, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1` (assuming `i` starts from 0).
   - `first` will remain False unless it is set to True inside the loop.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `first` will remain False unless it is set to True inside the loop.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.

Since we don't know if `first` will be set to True inside the loop, we assume it remains False for now.

**State:**
- `first` is False
- `i` is either 1 or the next key in `mpp` where `mpp[key] == 1`
- `n` must be greater than 0

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`first` is False, `i` is either 1 or the next key in `mpp` where `mpp[key] == 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
