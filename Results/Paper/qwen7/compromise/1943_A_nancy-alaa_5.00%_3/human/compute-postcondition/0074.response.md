Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is a boolean, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `i` is an integer, and it is described as `(i+1)`, which means `i` is an integer with a value of `i+1`.
- `n` is an integer greater than 0, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement `print(i)` will simply print the value of `i`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe it in terms of its definition.

Output: **i+1**
