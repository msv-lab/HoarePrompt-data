Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` remains `False`
- `i` is `0`
- `n` must be greater than `0`
- If the current value of `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, no changes are made to `i` and `first` remains as is.
- If `mpp[i]` is equal to `1` and `first` is `True`, no changes are made to `i` and `first` remains as is.

Given these conditions, let's break down the execution of the `print(i)` statement:

1. Initially, `i` is set to `0`.
2. Since `first` is `False`, the condition `if first is True` does not apply.
3. The check `if i not in mpp.keys()` will be evaluated. Since `i` is `0`, and no specific information about `mpp` is given, we cannot determine if `0` is in `mpp.keys()`. However, the postcondition states that if `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, no changes are made to `i` and `first` remains as is.
4. Since `first` is `False` and `i` is `0`, and no changes are made to `i` in this case, `i` remains `0`.

Therefore, when the `print(i)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i`, which is `0`.

Output: **0**
