Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `i` is not in `mpp.keys(), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where `i` is being checked against `n`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition `i` is not in `mpp.keys()` remain unchanged, but the program exits the current loop or conditional block.
