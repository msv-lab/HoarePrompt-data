Output State: idx is 2 + 2 * t, t is unchanged, data is unchanged, n is an integer obtained from int(data[0]), a is a list of integers obtained from data starting from idx + t to idx + 2 * t, results is a list of outputs from func_1(n, a) for each iteration, no change in the values of variables in results as they are printed but not modified within the loop.
