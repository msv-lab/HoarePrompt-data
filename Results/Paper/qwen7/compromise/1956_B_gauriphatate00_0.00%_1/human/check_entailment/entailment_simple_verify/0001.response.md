### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can get in the game, given that Nene will play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` aims to calculate the maximum number of points you can get by counting the number of pairs of cards in your hand.
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. Specifically, the function returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`. However, this does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for maximizing your score.
   - For example, consider the case where you have three pairs of cards (e.g., [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]). According to `func_1`, the function would return `min(3, 3 // 2) = 1`, which is incorrect. In reality, you can get up to 2 points by playing the pairs optimally.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - While the parsing logic is correct, the issue lies in the implementation of `func_1`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is incorrect because it does not account for the optimal strategy where you can potentially get more points by playing pairs strategically.
   - To correctly solve the problem, you need to consider the distribution of pairs and how Nene will block your points. The correct approach involves understanding that you can get points for each pair you have, minus the pairs that Nene can block.

### Conclusion:
The provided program incorrectly calculates the maximum number of points you can get. The logic in `func_1` does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for maximizing your score.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
