Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, the function extracts the hour (`h`) and minute (`s[2:]`) from the input string `s`.
3. The hour is then converted to the 12-hour format:
   - If the hour is '00', it is printed as '12'.
   - If the hour is between '01' and '12', it remains the same.
   - If the hour is between '13' and '23', it is converted by subtracting 12 and prefixed with '0'.
4. The AM/PM indicator is correctly set based on whether the hour is greater than or equal to '12'.
5. The function prints the formatted time followed by the AM/PM indicator for each test case.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in `func_1()` matches the requirements and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
