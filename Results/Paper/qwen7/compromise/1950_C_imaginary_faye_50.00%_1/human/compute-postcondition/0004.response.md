Functionality: **The function processes a series of time strings formatted as "hh:mm" and converts them into a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. For each input time, it prints the converted time string. If the input hour is '00', it is displayed as '12'. Hours from '01' to '12' remain unchanged. Hours from '13' to '23' are adjusted by subtracting 12 and prefixed with '0'. Additionally, it appends 'AM' or 'PM' based on whether the hour is greater than or equal to '12'. The function does not return any value; its primary action is to output the transformed time strings.**
