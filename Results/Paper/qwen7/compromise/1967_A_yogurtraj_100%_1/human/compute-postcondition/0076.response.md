Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is reduced by `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]))`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is 0, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or `n - 2 - i`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r` to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. Here, `k` is reduced by `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]))` from the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
