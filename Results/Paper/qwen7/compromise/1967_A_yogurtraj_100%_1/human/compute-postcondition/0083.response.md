Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is either 0 or reduced by `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]))`, `r` is either `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` or `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is either `k % (i + 1)` or 0, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or `n - 2 - i`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is 0 and `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]))`, `r` is `a[i + 1]`, and `rem` is 0.
