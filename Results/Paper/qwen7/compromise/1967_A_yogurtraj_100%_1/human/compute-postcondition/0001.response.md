Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value within the range 1 to 100.
