Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `rem` is either `k % (n - 1)` or 0.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is fully reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all iterations.
   - `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - `y` is 0.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Since `n` is 0, `i` (which is `n - 1`) becomes `-1`.
   - `rem` being either `k % (n - 1)` or 0 implies that `rem` could be `k % (-1)` or 0. However, since modulo operation with negative numbers can be complex, and typically results in a non-negative remainder, let's assume `rem` is 0 for simplicity.
   - `k` is fully reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all iterations. Given `i` is `-1`, this term does not apply because there are no valid `i` values (since `i` starts from `-1` and goes up to `n-1` which is `0-1 = -1`).
   - `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. Since `n` is 0, `k // n` is undefined in Python due to division by zero. However, if we interpret it as handling division by zero gracefully, it might result in an error or an undefined value. But for the sake of this problem, let's assume `r` is simply `a[-1]` (which doesn't exist) plus an undefined value, leading to an undefined `r`.

3. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`.
   - Since `n` is 0, any multiplication involving `n` will result in 0.
   - `k % n` is undefined due to division by zero.
   - `r` is undefined as explained above.

Given these observations, the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n` involves undefined operations and thus cannot produce a meaningful result.

Output: **undefined**
