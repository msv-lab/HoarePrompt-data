Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is reduced by `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]))`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the value of `y` to `n - 1 - i`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `a`, `k`, `r`, `rem`, or `y` except for updating `y` to `n - 1 - i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
