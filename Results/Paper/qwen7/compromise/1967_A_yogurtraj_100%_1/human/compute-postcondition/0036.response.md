Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is decreased by the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is equal to `a[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of `a[i + 1]`, which means `r` now holds the value of `a[4]` since `i` is 3. The value of `k` is decreased by the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, which translates to `4 * (a[4] - a[3])`. The initial state of `i` remains unchanged at 3.
