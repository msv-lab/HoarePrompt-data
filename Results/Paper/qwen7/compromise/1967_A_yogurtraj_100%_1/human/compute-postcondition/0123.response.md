Output State: **`rem` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), r` is equal to `a[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. Here, `i` is 2, so `r` becomes `a[3]`. The values of `rem`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are updated as described, but no new values are assigned to them, so their previous conditions remain valid.
