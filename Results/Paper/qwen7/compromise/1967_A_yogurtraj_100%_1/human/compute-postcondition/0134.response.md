Postcondition: **`rem` is either `k % 3` or 0, `i` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, `n` is `n - 1` and must still be greater than 1, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is either `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` or `a[i + 1]`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is 0, `i` is either 1 or 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
