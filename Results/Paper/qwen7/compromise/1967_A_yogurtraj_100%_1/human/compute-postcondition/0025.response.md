Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its original value, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers.**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `k` is updated by subtracting the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its original value. The value of `n` remains greater than 2, and `a` is still a list of integers.
