Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n - 2`, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is either reduced to 0 or left with a non-negative value that cannot be further reduced by the loop, `r` holds the final value determined during the last iteration, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is equal to the number of iterations performed, `a`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop, and the current value of `k` is not 0**.
