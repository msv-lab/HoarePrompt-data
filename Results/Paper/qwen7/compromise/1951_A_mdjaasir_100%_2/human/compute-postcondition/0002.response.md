Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses based on the conditions evaluated within the loop for each iteration. Specifically, for each value of `n` (read from input) and string `a` (also read from input), the code checks the count of '1's in `a`. If the count is 0, it prints 'YES'. If the count is greater than 2 and even, it prints 'YES'. If the count is exactly 2, it checks if the second '1' is not immediately following the first '1'; if so, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. For all other cases, it prints 'NO'. The final output state will be a list of these responses in the order they were generated during the loop iterations.
