Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (length of the array), and a list arr (containing n integers). For each test case, it calls `func_1` on the array arr, stores the result, and collects all results in a list. Finally, it prints each result on a new line.**
