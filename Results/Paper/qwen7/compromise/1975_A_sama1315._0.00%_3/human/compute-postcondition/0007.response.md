Output State: `index` is 6, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `results` is a list containing elements generated by `func_1(arr)` for each iteration. The length of `results` list is equal to `t`. `index` is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop and by `n` (where `n` is the value of `int(data[index])`) at the end of each iteration.
