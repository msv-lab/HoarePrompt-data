Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input `number` such that the number of increasing subsequences in the generated sequence is exactly `number`.
   - The logic inside `func_1` involves bitwise operations and dynamic programming-like approach to construct the sequence. It ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `number`.

3. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is built by appending values in a specific pattern, ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `number`.
   - The function recursively reduces the `number` and constructs the sequence accordingly.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself.
   - The logic in `func_1` guarantees that the constructed sequence meets the requirement of having exactly `number` increasing subsequences.

Given the problem statement and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly constructs the sequence based on the input `number`. The sequence generation logic is sound and ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `number`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
