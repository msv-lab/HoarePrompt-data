Output State: **`size_overlap` is (0, 1), `sequence` must be non-negative, `i` is max(sequence, default=0), `size` is `i + 2`, `value` is \((1 << i + 2) - (1 << i + 1)\), and `number` must be at least 3.**

Explanation: The code `size += 1` increments the value of `size` by 1. Initially, `size` was `i + 1`. Since `i` is `max(sequence, default=0)`, and `sequence` is non-negative, `i` is at least 0. Therefore, after the increment, `size` becomes `i + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
