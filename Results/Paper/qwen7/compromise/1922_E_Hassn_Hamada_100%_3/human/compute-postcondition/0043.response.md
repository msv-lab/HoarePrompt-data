Output State: **`size` is 8, `i` is 7, `number` must be at least 128, `value` is 255, and `size_overlap` is (7, 7)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `value` using the bitwise left shift operator. Specifically, `(1 << size) - (1 << i)` translates to `(1 << 8) - (1 << 7)`. 

- `(1 << 8)` results in `256`.
- `(1 << 7)` results in `128`.
- Subtracting `128` from `256` gives `128`.

However, since the initial value of `value` was `63`, and the operation does not involve `number` or `size_overlap`, those variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `value` is `255`.
