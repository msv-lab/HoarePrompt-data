Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is given by:
   \[
   (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) \leq number
   \]
   This condition checks if the difference between \(2^{size+1}\) and \(2^i\) is less than or equal to `number`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `size` is 8
   - `i` is 7
   - `number` must be at least 128
   - `value` is 255 (not relevant for this loop condition)
   - `size_overlap` is (7, 7) (not relevant for this loop condition)

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition**:
   - Calculate \(2^{size+1}\):
     \[
     2^{8+1} = 2^9 = 512
     \]
   - Calculate \(2^i\):
     \[
     2^7 = 128
     \]
   - Compute the difference:
     \[
     512 - 128 = 384
     \]
   - Check if this difference is less than or equal to `number`:
     \[
     384 \leq number
     \]
   - Since `number` must be at least 128, and 384 is indeed greater than 128, the condition is satisfied.

4. **Next Iteration Requirement**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition must still be true.
   - We need to ensure that the difference \(2^{size+1} - 2^i\) remains less than or equal to `number`.
   - To maintain this condition, `size` should remain 8, `i` should remain 7, and `number` must remain at least 128.

### Conclusion:
The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `size` must remain 8
- `i` must remain 7
- `number` must remain at least 128

Therefore, the modified state is:
State: **`size` is 8, `i` is 7, `number` must be at least 128**
