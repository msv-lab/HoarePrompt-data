Output State: **`size_overlap` is (1, 1), `sequence` must be non-negative, `i` must be at least 1, `size` is `i + 2`, `value` is \(1 << i\), and `number` must be at least 3.**

The code `size += 1` increments the value of `size` by 1. Given the initial state where `size` is `i + 2`, after executing the code, `size` becomes `i + 3`. However, since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we keep it in the form of `i + 3`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
