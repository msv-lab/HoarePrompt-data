Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is given by the expression `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`.
2. **Current States**:
   - `size` is 4.
   - `size_overlap` remains (2, 1).
   - `sequence` must be non-negative.
   - `i` must be at least 1.
   - `number` must be at least 14.
   - `value` is 14.

3. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables involved in the loop head are `size`, `i`, and `number`.

4. **Evaluate the Loop Condition**:
   - Substitute the current values into the loop condition:
     \[
     (1 << 4 + 1) - (1 << i) \leq number
     \]
     Simplifying this:
     \[
     (1 << 5) - (1 << i) \leq number
     \]
     \[
     32 - (1 << i) \leq number
     \]

5. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition must still hold true.
   - Since `number` must be at least 14 and `value` is 14, let's assume `number` is exactly 14 for simplicity (since it must be at least 14 and no other constraints are given).
   - We need to find the smallest `i` such that the condition holds:
     \[
     32 - (1 << i) \leq 14
     \]
     Solving for `i`:
     \[
     32 - 14 \leq 1 << i
     \]
     \[
     18 \leq 1 << i
     \]
     The smallest `i` that satisfies this is `i = 5` because \(1 << 5 = 32\).

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `size` remains 4.
   - `i` must be at least 5 for the loop to continue.
   - `number` must remain at least 14.

### Final State:
State: **`size` is 4, `i` must be at least 5, `number` must be at least 14**
