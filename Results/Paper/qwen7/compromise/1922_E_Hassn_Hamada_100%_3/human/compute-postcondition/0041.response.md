Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`.

2. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - `1 << size + 1` shifts the binary representation of 1 left by `size + 1` bits.
   - `1 << i` shifts the binary representation of 1 left by `i` bits.
   - The expression `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` calculates the difference between these two values.

3. **Determine the current values**:
   - `size` is 7.
   - `i` is 7.
   - `number` is at least 14.
   - `value` is 63 (this is not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `size_overlap` is (7, 7) (this is not relevant to the loop condition).

4. **Calculate the loop condition with the current values**:
   - `(1 << (7 + 1)) - (1 << 7) = (1 << 8) - (1 << 7) = 256 - 128 = 128`.
   - The condition becomes `128 <= number`.

5. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - Since `number` is at least 14, it is not guaranteed that `128 <= number` is true. Therefore, the loop cannot execute with the current values.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to adjust the state such that the loop condition `128 <= number` is satisfied.
   - The only variable that can be adjusted is `number`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `number` is at least 128.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`size` is 7, `i` is 7, `number` must be at least 128, `value` is 63, and `size_overlap` is (7, 7)**
