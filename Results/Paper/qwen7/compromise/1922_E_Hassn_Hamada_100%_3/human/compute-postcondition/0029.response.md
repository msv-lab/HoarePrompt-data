Output State: **`size` is 5, `i` must be at least 5, `number` must be at least 14, `value` is 2^5 - 2^i**

Explanation: The code calculates `value` using the expression `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. Given that `size` is 5 and `i` must be at least 5, the expression simplifies to `value = 2^5 - 2^i`. Since `i` must be at least 5, the minimum value for `value` would be `2^5 - 2^5 = 0`. However, since `i` could be greater than 5, `value` could be less than 0. But without a specific value for `i`, the most accurate representation is that `value` is `2^5 - 2^i`, where `i` is at least 5. The initial conditions for `size`, `i`, and `number` remain unchanged.
