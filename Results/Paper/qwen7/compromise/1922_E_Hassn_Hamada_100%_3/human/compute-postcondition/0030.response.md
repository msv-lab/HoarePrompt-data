Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is given by the expression `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`.

2. **Understand the variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `size`: This is a constant or a variable that does not change within the loop.
   - `i`: This is a variable that changes within the loop.
   - `number`: This is a constant or a variable that does not change within the loop.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `size` is 5.
   - `i` must be at least 5.
   - `number` must be at least 14.
   - `value` is \(2^5 - 2^i\).

4. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) \leq number\).
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     (1 << (5 + 1)) - (1 << i) = (1 << 6) - (1 << i) = 64 - (1 << i)
     \]
   - The loop condition becomes:
     \[
     64 - (1 << i) \leq number
     \]

5. **Check the current state**:
   - Since `i` must be at least 5, let's check the smallest possible value for `i`, which is 5.
   - For \(i = 5\):
     \[
     64 - (1 << 5) = 64 - 32 = 32
     \]
   - Given that `number` must be at least 14, 32 is indeed greater than 14, so the loop would not continue if `i` is exactly 5.

6. **Adjust the state to allow the loop to continue**:
   - To ensure the loop continues, `i` must be such that the expression \(64 - (1 << i)\) is still less than or equal to `number`.
   - Since `number` must be at least 14, the smallest `i` that satisfies this condition is 6 (since \(64 - (1 << 6) = 32\) and 32 is greater than 14, but \(64 - (1 << 7) = 16\) is still greater than 14, and so on).
   - Therefore, `i` must be at least 6.

7. **Final state**:
   - `size` remains 5.
   - `i` must be at least 6.
   - `number` must be at least 14.
   - `value` is \(2^5 - 2^i\), which will change based on the new value of `i`.

Thus, the final state to allow the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`size` is 5, `i` must be at least 6, `number` must be at least 14**
