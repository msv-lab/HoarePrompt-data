Output State: `size` is 12, `i` is 0, `number` must be at least 128, `value` is 1022.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `size` as long as `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`. Given that `i` starts at 7 and remains unchanged, and considering the condition must hold true for each iteration, the loop will continue to increment `size` until the expression no longer holds. Since `i` is fixed at 7 and `number` must be at least 128, the maximum `size` can reach is when `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << 7) > 128`, which happens when `size` is 12. At this point, `value` will be `(1 << 12) - (1 << 7) = 4096 - 128 = 1022`. Therefore, after all iterations, `size` will be 12, `i` will be 0 (since it decreases with each iteration and cannot go below 0), `number` must still be at least 128, and `value` will be 1022.
