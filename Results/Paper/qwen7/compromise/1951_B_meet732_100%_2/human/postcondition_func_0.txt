The function accepts a list `a` of distinct integers representing cow ratings and an index `k` (1 <= k <= n). It searches for indices of at most two cows with ratings greater than the k-th cow's rating. Based on the number of such cows found and their positions, it returns a specific value. If no such cows are found, it returns a value related to the last cow's index. If only one such cow is found, it returns a value based on the position of this cow relative to `k`. If two such cows are found, it returns a value based on their positions relative to each other and `k`.
