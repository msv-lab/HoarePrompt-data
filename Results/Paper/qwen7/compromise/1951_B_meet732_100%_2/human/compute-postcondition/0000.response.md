Output State: **a is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and 1 <= k <= n where k is the index of the cow you own; x is the k-th element of list a.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the k-th element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. The list `a` and the condition on `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new assignment of `x` to the k-th element of `a`.
