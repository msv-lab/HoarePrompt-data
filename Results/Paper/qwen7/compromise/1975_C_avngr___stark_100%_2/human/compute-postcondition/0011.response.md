Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is 0, `temp` is a slice of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i+3**.

This means that `temp` is assigned a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i+3`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
