The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since the `continue` statement does not modify any variables and simply skips to the next iteration, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers converted from input, and `max` is the second largest value among any three consecutive elements in the list `a`.**
