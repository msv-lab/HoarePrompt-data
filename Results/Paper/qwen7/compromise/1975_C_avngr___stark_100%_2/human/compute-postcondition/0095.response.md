Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function returns a value based on the given constraints and input data.**

Note: The function indirectly accepts input through the structure of the test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer n and a list of n integers a_i. The function processes these inputs according to the specified constraints and returns a result for each test case.
