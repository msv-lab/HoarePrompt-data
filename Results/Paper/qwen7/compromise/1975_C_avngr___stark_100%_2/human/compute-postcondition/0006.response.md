Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` equals 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and we continue the loop or statement.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement itself does not affect the values of these variables but indicates that the loop or statement will proceed to the next iteration.
