Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(0, x)`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - `x` is the same as before (we don't know its exact value, but it must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to continue).

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 4.
   - `x` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `x` remains unchanged.

5. **Construct the New State:**
   - The list `l` and the flag `flag` are not affected by the loop head, so they remain the same as before.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 4, `x` is the same as before**
