Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\) and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `i` is an index such that \(0 \leq i < x\), `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers. If `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
