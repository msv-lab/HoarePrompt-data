Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\) and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `i` is equal to `x`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, and `flag` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` takes an input and assigns it to the variable `x`. The value of `t`, `n`, `p`, `i`, `l`, and `flag` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `i` is updated to be equal to the new value of `x`, and `flag` remains `False` because no condition involving `l` and `i` has been evaluated yet.
