Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is a new input integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\) and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `i` is equal to `x + 1`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split and mapped to integers, and `flag` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, x):
    if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
        flag = True
        print(2)
        break
else:
    print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `l` is a list of integers. If the element at index `i` in list `l` points to an index in `l` such that the element at that index is equal to `i + 1`, then `flag` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the condition is not met, the postcondition remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `x` is the same as before, `flag` is True if `l[3 - 1] == 4` (i.e., `l[2] == 4`), and `flag` remains unchanged if `l[3 - 1] != 4` (i.e., `l[2] != 4`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 4, `x` is the same as before, and if `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`, then `flag` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l[l[i] - 1]` does not equal `i + 1`, then `flag` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
