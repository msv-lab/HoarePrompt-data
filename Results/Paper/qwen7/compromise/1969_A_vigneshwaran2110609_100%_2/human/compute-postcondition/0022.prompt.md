Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, x):
    if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
        flag = True
        print(2)
        break
else:
    print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `i` is an index within the range of the list `p`, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, if `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`, then the flag is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited; otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\) and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `i` is an index such that \(0 \leq i < x\), `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers. If `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\) and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, and `flag` is `True` if `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`, otherwise `flag` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
