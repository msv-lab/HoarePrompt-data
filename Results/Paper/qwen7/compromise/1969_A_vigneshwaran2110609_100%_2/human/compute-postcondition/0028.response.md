Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\) and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `i` is equal to `0`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, and `flag` is `False`. The value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`.**
