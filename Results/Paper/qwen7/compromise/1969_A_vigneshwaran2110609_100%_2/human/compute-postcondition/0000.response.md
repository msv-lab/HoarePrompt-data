Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and the list `p` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, `t` is still an integer within the range 1 to 5000, `n` is now an integer input by the user within the specified range, and `p` remains as a list of integers with the given conditions.
