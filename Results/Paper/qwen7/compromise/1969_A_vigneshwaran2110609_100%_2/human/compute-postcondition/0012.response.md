Output State: **`flag` is `True`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\) and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `i` is an index such that \(0 \leq i < x\), `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The line `flag = True` simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `flag`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, `i`, `x`, and `l` are still as per the initial state.
