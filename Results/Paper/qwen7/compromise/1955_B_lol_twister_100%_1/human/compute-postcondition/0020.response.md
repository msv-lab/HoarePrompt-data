Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for k in range(0, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `k` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior**: The loop iterates over `k` from `0` to `n-1`. Each iteration calculates an element for the list `li` using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` where `h` ranges from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - The list `li` contains `n` elements.
   - The last value of `k` in the previous iteration would be `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `k` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `k` should be `n`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the range.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `k`.

**State:**
**`li` is a list of `n` elements, `a`, `c`, and `d` retain their original values, `k` is `n`**.

So, the final state is:
State: **`li` is a list of `n` elements, `a` retains its value, `c` retains its value, `d` retains its value, `k` is `n`**.
