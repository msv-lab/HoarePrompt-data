Output State: `li` is a list with `n` elements, each element being `a + k * c + d * h` where `h` ranges from `0` to `n-1`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `li` will contain `n` elements. Each element in the list is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`, with `h` taking on every integer value from `0` to `n-1`. For example, if `n` is 5, the list will be `[a + k * c, a + k * c + d, a + k * c + 2*d, a + k * c + 3*d, a + k * c + 4*d]`.
