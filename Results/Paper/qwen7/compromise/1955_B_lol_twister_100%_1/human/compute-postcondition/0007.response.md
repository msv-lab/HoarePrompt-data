Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for h in range(0, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `h` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is 0
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500
   - `h` is 1
   - `li` is a list containing the value `a + k * c + d * h` and the appended value `a + k * c + d * h`

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `h` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `h` is 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `h` will be 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `h` should be less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `h` is 1, so for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 1. Given the constraint 2 <= n <= 500, `n` can still be any value within this range.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `h` is incremented by 1, so `h` becomes 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head, but it must still satisfy the condition 2 <= n <= 500.

5. **Update the list `li`**:
   - The list `li` contains the values `a + k * c + d * h` for the current and previous values of `h`.
   - For `h = 0`, the value is `a + k * c + d * 0 = a + k * c`.
   - For `h = 1`, the value is `a + k * c + d * 1 = a + k * c + d`.
   - For `h = 2`, the value is `a + k * c + d * 2 = a + k * c + 2d`.
   - Therefore, `li` will now contain `[a + k * c, a + k * c + d, a + k * c + 2d]`.

Putting it all together, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`k` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `h` is 2, `li` is a list containing the values [a + k * c, a + k * c + d, a + k * c + 2d]**
