The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `c`, and `d`, and a list `l`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]. 

The function checks some condition(s) based on these inputs and returns either 'yes' or 'no'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, two integers `c` and `d`, and a list `l` of n^2 integers, and return 'yes' or 'no' based on certain conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer between 2 and 500), c and d (integers between 1 and 10^6), and a list l of n^2 integers. It returns 'yes' or 'no' based on specific conditions.**
