Output State: The list `li` will contain `n` elements, each calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. The values of `a`, `c`, `d`, and `k` remain unchanged.

In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `li` will look like this: `[a + k * c, a + k * c + d, a + k * c + 2*d, ..., a + k * c + (n-1)*d]`. This means it starts with the initial value `a + k * c` and each subsequent element increases by `d` until it reaches `a + k * c + (n-1)*d`. The variable `h` will have been incremented to `n-1` by the end of the loop, but this does not affect the final state of `li`.
