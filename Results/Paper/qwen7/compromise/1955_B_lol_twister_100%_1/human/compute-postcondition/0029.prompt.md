Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]; `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`; `li` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(0, n):
    for h in range(0, n):
        li.append(a + k * c + d * h)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `k` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `h` is n-1, `li` is a list containing the values [a, a + d, a + 2d, ..., a + (n-1)d].

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `h` will be equal to `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The list `li` will contain `n` elements, each calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`, where `h` ranges from `0` to `n-1`. Given that `k` remains `0` throughout the loop, the formula simplifies to `a + d * h`, resulting in the sequence `[a, a + d, a + 2d, ..., a + (n-1)d]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The list `li` will contain `n` elements, each calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. Specifically, `li` will be `[a + k * c, a + k * c + d, a + k * c + 2*d, ..., a + k * c + (n-1)*d]`.

In this final state, the list `li` starts with the value `a + k * c` and increments by `d` for each subsequent element, up to `n` elements in total. The variables `a`, `c`, `d`, and `k` retain their original values, and `h` is no longer used in the list construction but was incremented in the loop to reach `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `li` is a list with `n` elements: `a + k * c`, `a + k * c + d`, `a + k * c + d * 2`, ..., `a + k * c + d * (n-1)`. The value of `n` must be greater than 0.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `li` will contain `n` elements where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. The initial conditions require that `n` must be greater than 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
