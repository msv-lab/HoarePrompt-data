Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the minimum value in the input list `l` is not equal to \(a_{1,1}\), which is supposed to be the smallest element in the progressive square. According to the rules, the smallest element \(a_{1,1}\) should be the minimum value in the sorted list `li`. However, the program assumes that the smallest element in `l` is \(a_{1,1}\) without checking this condition. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 2 3
3 9 6 5 7 11
```
In this case, the minimum value in the input list is 3, but the correct \(a_{1,1}\) should be 1 (since the progressive square starts with 1, 2, 3...). The program will fail to recognize this and incorrectly output "YES".

To fix this, the program needs to check if the smallest element in the input list matches the calculated \(a_{1,1}\) before proceeding with the comparison.
