Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly implements the logic to check if the given list of integers `l` can form a progressive square based on the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`.
2. The function `func_1` first finds the minimum value `a` in the list `l`.
3. It then generates a list `li` containing the expected values of a progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` and `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
4. After generating `li`, it sorts both `li` and `l` and checks if they are equal.
5. If they are equal, it returns `'yes'`, indicating that the list `l` can form a progressive square. Otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to verify if the given list can form a progressive square.

Correctness: **True**
