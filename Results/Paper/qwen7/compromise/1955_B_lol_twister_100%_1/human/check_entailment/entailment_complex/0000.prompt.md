Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, c and d are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and l is a list of n^2 integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9].
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
        
    #State: Output State: `li` is a list with `n` elements: `a + k * c`, `a + k * c + d`, `a + k * c + 2*d`, ..., `a + k * c + (n-1)*d`. The value of `n` must be greater than 0.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `li` will contain `n` elements where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. This means the list `li` will start with the value `a + k * c` and increment by `d` for each subsequent element, up to `n` elements in total. The variables `a`, `c`, `d`, and `k` retain their original values, and `h` is no longer used in the list construction but was incremented in the loop to reach `n-1`.
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if (l == li) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns 'yes'
    #State: `li` is a sorted list with `n` elements: `a + k * c`, `a + k * c + d`, `a + k * c + 2*d`, ..., `a + k * c + (n-1)*d` and the list is not equal to `l`.
    return 'no'
    #The program returns 'no'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (an integer between 2 and 500), `c` and `d` (integers between 1 and \(10^6\)), and a list `l` containing \(n^2\) integers each in the range [1, \(10^9\)]. It generates a new list `li` by calculating values based on `a` (the minimum value in `l`), `c`, `d`, and `k` (ranging from 0 to `n-1`). After sorting both `li` and `l`, the function checks if they are equal. If they are equal, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.
