### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l` containing `n^2` integers.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function calculates the expected values of the progressive square starting from the minimum value `a` in the list `l`.
   - It generates a list `li` where each element is computed as `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` and `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
   - The list `li` is then sorted.
   - The input list `l` is also sorted.
   - Finally, it checks if the sorted lists `li` and `l` are equal and returns 'yes' or 'no' accordingly.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Minimum Value Check:**
   - The original assessment claims that the program does not check if the minimum value in the input list `l` matches the calculated `a_{1,1}`.
   - In the annotated code, it is clear that `a` is set to the minimum value in `l` (`a = min(l)`).
   - The program then proceeds to generate the expected values using this `a` and checks if the generated list matches the sorted input list.

2. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach in the program is correct because:
     - The smallest element in the progressive square is indeed the minimum value in the list `l`.
     - By setting `a` to the minimum value in `l`, the program ensures that the smallest element in the generated list `li` is the same as the smallest element in the input list `l`.
     - Sorting both lists and comparing them ensures that the entire list `l` matches the expected values of the progressive square.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate. The program correctly handles the case where the minimum value in the input list `l` is not equal to \(a_{1,1}\) because it sets `a` to the minimum value in `l` and generates the expected values accordingly. The comparison of the sorted lists ensures that the input list matches the expected values of the progressive square.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
