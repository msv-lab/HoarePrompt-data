### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Generation of Progressive Square**: The function `func_1` correctly generates the progressive square starting from the minimum value `a` in the list `l`. The formula `a + k * c + d * h` ensures that the values follow the required pattern.
2. **Sorting and Comparison**: Both `li` and `l` are sorted before comparing them. This ensures that the order of elements does not affect the comparison.
3. **Minimum Value Check**: The original assessment claims that the program does not check if the smallest element in the input list `l` matches the calculated `a_{1,1}`. However, the code already starts by setting `a` to the minimum value in `l`, which is the correct `a_{1,1}` for the progressive square.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- **Initialization of `a`**: The variable `a` is set to the minimum value in the list `l` using `a = min(l)`. This ensures that `a` is indeed the smallest element in the list, which corresponds to `a_{1,1}` in the progressive square.
- **Loop Construction**: The nested loops generate the progressive square values based on `a`, `c`, and `d`. The values are stored in the list `li`.
- **Sorting and Comparison**: Both `li` and `l` are sorted, and the program checks if they are equal. Since `a` is the minimum value in `l`, and the progressive square is generated starting from `a`, the sorted lists should match if the input list `l` contains the correct elements for the progressive square.

Given the above points, the program correctly handles the generation and verification of the progressive square. The original assessment is inaccurate because the program does indeed check and use the correct `a_{1,1}` value.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided inputs.
