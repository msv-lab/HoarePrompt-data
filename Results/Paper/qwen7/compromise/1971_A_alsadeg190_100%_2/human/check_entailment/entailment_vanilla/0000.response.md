### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `x` from the first line.
2. **Loop Iteration**: It then iterates `x` times to handle each test case.
3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` using `input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list of strings. `map(int, ...)` converts these strings into integers.
4. **Finding Min and Max**: 
   - If `x < y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.
5. **Output Format**: The output format matches the requirement of printing the minimum value first, followed by the maximum value for each test case.

Given that the logic correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values and prints them in the required order, the program appears to be correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
