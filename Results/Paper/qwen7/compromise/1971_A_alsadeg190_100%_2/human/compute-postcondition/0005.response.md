Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from input. It then prints either `(x, y)` if `x` is less than `y`, or `(y, x)` otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results of each comparison.**
