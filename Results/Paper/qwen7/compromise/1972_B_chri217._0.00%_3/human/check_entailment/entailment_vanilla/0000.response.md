### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: 
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`. This approach is correct for handling multiple test cases.
   
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - The program iterates over each test case using a loop. This is correct for processing multiple test cases.

3. **Extracting Test Case Data**:
   - For each test case, it correctly extracts `n` (the number of coins) and `s` (the string representing the state of the coins).
   
4. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(s)` to determine the winner for each test case. This is correct.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of coins facing up (`num_up`).
   - If `num_up` is odd, it returns `'YES'`, indicating Alice wins.
   - If `num_up` is even, it returns `'NO'`, indicating Bob wins.
   
6. **Game Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is based on the observation that the game's outcome depends on whether the number of facing-up coins is odd or even. This is correct according to the problem statement.
   - The game rules ensure that the number of facing-up coins changes in such a way that an odd number remains odd and an even number remains even after each move, leading to the conclusion that the game will end with an odd number of coins if Alice starts with an odd number, and Bob will win otherwise.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the initial number of coins facing up.

### Correctness:
