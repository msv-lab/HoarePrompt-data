Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`; `ans1` is decreased by `4 * a[k - 1] + 4 * a[i]`**

Explanation: Initially, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[k - 1] + a[i] * 2`. The code then further decreases `ans1` by `a[i] * 2`. Combining these two operations, `ans1` is effectively decreased by `2 * a[k - 1] + a[i] * 2 + a[i] * 2`, which simplifies to `2 * a[k - 1] + 2 * a[i] * 2` or `4 * a[k - 1] + 4 * a[i]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the given code snippet.
