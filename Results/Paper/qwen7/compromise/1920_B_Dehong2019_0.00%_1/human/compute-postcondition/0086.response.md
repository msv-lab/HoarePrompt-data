Output State: **`i` is `x`, `ans1` is reduced by 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a`, and `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `0` to `x-1`, and in each iteration, it subtracts `2 * a[i]` from `ans1`. After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `x` (since the loop increments `i` from `0` to `x-1`), and `ans1` will be reduced by twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a`. The variable `ans2` is then assigned the value of `ans1`, so `ans2` is also equal to the updated value of `ans1`.
