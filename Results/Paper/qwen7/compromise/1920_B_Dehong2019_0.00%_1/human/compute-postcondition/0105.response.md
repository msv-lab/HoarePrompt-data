Postcondition: `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is `k - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum of the new `ans1` and `ans2`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is further decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`, `i` is increased by 1, `k` is decreased by 1 and must remain greater than 0, and `ans` is updated to be the maximum of the new `ans1` and `ans2`. If `i + x >= n`, the values of `ans1`, `i`, `k`, and `ans` remain as they were after the initial increase of `ans1` by `a[i]`, increment of `i` by 1, decrement of `k` by 1, and setting `ans` to the maximum of the new `ans1` and `ans2`.
