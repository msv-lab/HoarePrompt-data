Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the constant `k`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < k`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is equal to the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1 + 1 = i + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `k`. Therefore, the new value of `i` should be `i + 1` (from the previous iteration) plus 1, which means `i` is now `i + 2`.
   - The value of `ans` does not change within the loop body based on the given information, so it remains `ans` being the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is now `i + 2`.
   - `k` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`ans` is equal to the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `i + 2`**.
