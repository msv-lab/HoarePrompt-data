Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans1` is `ans1 - a[1] * 2`**

Explanation: The variable `i` is initially set to 1 and must be less than `x`. The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of `a[i]` (where `i` is 1) from `ans1`. Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]`, and thus `ans1` is updated to `ans1 - a[1] * 2`. The condition that `i` must be less than `x` remains unchanged.
