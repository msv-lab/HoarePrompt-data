Output State: `i` is `k + x - 1`, `ans1` is decreased by the sum of `2 * a[k - 1] + 2 * a[k] + ... + 2 * a[k + x - 2]`.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations (from 0 to `x-1`), the variable `i` will be equal to `k + x - 1`. The variable `ans1` will have been decreased by the sum of twice each element from index `k - 1` to `k + x - 2` in the list `a`.
