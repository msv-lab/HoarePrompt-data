Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `range(k)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is the maximum of the new `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - `ans1` is increased by `a[i_new]`.
   - `k` must be greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `k` must still be greater than 0. Since the loop has executed once, `k` is now `k - 1`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so if it was `i` at the end of the previous iteration, it will become `i + 1` in the next iteration.
- `k` will be decremented by 1, so if it was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will become `k - 1` in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ans` is the maximum of the new `ans1` and `ans2`, `ans1` is increased by `a[i_new]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is `k - 1` and must be greater than 0**.
