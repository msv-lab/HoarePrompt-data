Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 0
   - `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Consider the effect of the loop body**: The loop body decreases `ans1` by `a[0] * 2`. However, since we are only adjusting the state for the next iteration, we do not need to consider the exact value of `ans1` but rather the condition under which the loop continues.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 1
- `x` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration
- `ans1` is still affected by the loop body, but we do not need to specify its exact value since it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be the same as before, `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`**.
