Output State: **`i` is `k`, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[k - 1] + a[i] * 2`**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `i` is equal to `k`, and `ans1` is already decreased by `2 * a[k - 1]`. The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` further decreases `ans1` by `2 * a[i] * 2`. Since `i` is `k`, the updated value of `ans1` is the initial decrease plus the additional decrease, which is `2 * a[k - 1] + a[i] * 2`.
