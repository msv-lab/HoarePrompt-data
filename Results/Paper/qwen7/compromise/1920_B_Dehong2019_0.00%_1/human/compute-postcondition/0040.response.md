Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `x` is an integer input, `i` is equal to `k - 1`, `ans1` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` minus twice the sum of the elements from index `x` to `x + k - 1` (if within bounds), `ans2` retains its initial value, and `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The code `a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)` takes an input string, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, sorts these integers in descending order, and assigns the sorted list to `a`. The values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and the loop counter `_` remain unchanged.
