Output State: `i` is `x`, `ans1` is `ans1 - 2 * sum(a[0:x])`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `x` because it increments with each iteration and loops back to 0 every `k` iterations. The variable `ans1` will be reduced by twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a`. This is because the loop subtracts `2 * a[i]` for each iteration from `ans1`, and since `i` cycles through the indices of `a` up to `x-1`, `ans1` is effectively reduced by `2 * sum(a[0:x])`.
