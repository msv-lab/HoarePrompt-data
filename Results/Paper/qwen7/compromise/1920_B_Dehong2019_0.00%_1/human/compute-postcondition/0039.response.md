Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `x` is an integer input, `i` is equal to `k - 1`, `ans1` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` minus twice the sum of the elements from index `x` to `x + k - 1` (if within bounds), `ans2` retains its initial value, and the loop counter `_` is set to 0.**

This output state reflects that the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are updated to the integer inputs received from the user. The value of `i` is updated to `k - 1`. The calculation for `ans1` remains unchanged, and `ans2` and the loop counter `_` are reset as per the given conditions.
