Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `idx` is defined as `2 + t`, where `t` is an integer.
   - `t` is equal to `int(data[0])`, meaning `t` is the integer value of the first element in the `data` list.
   - `results` is a list containing `t` elements, and each element is the result of calling `func_1` on a list of integers.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The code snippet is `print('\n'.join(results))`.

Given this, let's determine what will be printed:

- `t` is an integer derived from `data[0]`.
- `results` is a list with `t` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to a list of integers.
- When `'\n'.join(results)` is executed, it concatenates all elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).

Therefore, the output will be a string where each line corresponds to one of the elements in the `results` list, with each element being the result of `func_1` applied to a list of integers.

Output: **the results of `func_1` applied to a list of integers, each on a new line**
