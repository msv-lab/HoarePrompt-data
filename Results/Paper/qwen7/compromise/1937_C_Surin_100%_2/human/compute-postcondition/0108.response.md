Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current Values**:
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is currently 2, the loop will execute again if `n` is greater than 2.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `r` is the input string from the user, `v2` is 2, `v1` is 2, `prev` is 1, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0, and if `r` equals '<', then `v1` remains 2.**
