Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `i + 1`: This means `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` is at least 2: This provides context about the value of `n`, but it's not directly relevant to the print statement.
   - `r` is an input string: This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.
   - `prev` is equal to `i` from the previous iteration: This means `prev` holds the value of `i` before it was incremented.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
   ```

Given this information, let's determine the values that will be printed:

- `i` is the current value after being incremented by 1.
- `prev` is the value of `i` before it was incremented.

So, if we denote the value of `i` before incrementing as `i_prev`, then:
- `i = i_prev + 1`
- `prev = i_prev`

Substituting these into the print statement:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```
This translates to:
```python
print(f'? (i_prev + 1) (i_prev + 1) i_prev i_prev')
```

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [i_prev + 1] [i_prev + 1] [i_prev] [i_prev]**
