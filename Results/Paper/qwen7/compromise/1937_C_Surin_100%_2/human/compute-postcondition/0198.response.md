Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 6, `v2` is 3, `v1` is 3, `r` is the input from the user**

Explanation: The code `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is 3) to `v1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `v1` is now 3, while `i`, `n`, `v2`, and `r` retain their original values.
