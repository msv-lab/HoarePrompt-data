Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 2, `r` is the input from the user after the last iteration, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `prev = 0` updates the value of the variable `prev` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
