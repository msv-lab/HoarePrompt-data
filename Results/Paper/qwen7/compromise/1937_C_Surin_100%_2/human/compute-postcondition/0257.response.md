Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: the number of test cases \( t \) and for each test case, the size of the permutation \( n \). For each test case, it interacts with an external entity to determine the permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) through a series of queries and does not return any value.**
