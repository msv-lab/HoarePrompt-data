Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer, which means it ensures that any buffered output is written out to the console immediately. Since no variables are assigned new values or affected by this operation, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
