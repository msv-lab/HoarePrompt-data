Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3
- `n` must be at least 2 (though `n` is not used in the print statement)
- `v2` is 3

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Here, `v1` is not defined in the initial state, so it is not clear what value `v1` holds. Since `v1` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its value from the given information. Therefore, the placeholders `{v1}` will remain as they are in the output.

Given that `v2` is explicitly stated to be 3, the placeholders `{v2}` will be replaced with 3.

So, the print statement will output:
Output: **? {v1} {v1} 3 3**
