Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `r` is an input string**

The variable `r` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user, which is treated as a string. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for `n` to be greater than 4 still holds.
