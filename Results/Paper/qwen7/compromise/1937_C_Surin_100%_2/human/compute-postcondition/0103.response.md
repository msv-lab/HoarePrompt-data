Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is either the string '<' or no string (if the if part did not execute), `v2` is 2, `v1` is 1, `prev` is 1, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which means it ensures that all pending output is written to the terminal. Since no variables are modified or checked by this line of code, the values of all variables remain unchanged.
