Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 6, `r` is an input string such that if `r` is '>', then `prev` is set to 1. Otherwise, `r` is either '=', with `r2` being either '<' and `prev` set to 1, or `r2` is not '<', and the standard output is flushed.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the standard output buffer but does not change any variable values. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `r`, and `prev` remain unchanged from their initial states. Additionally, the fact that `r2` is either '<' when `r` is '=' remains valid.
