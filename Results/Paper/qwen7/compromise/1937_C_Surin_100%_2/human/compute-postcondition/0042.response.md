Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` must be within the range [1, n-1]
- `n` must be at least 2
- `r` is an input string and the current value of `r` is '='

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

Here, `prev` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is likely a variable that holds a previous value. Since no specific value for `prev` is given, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `prev` is used twice in the print statement, so we can infer that the same value will be printed both times.

Given the constraints and the information provided, the output will be:
Output: **? i i prev prev**
