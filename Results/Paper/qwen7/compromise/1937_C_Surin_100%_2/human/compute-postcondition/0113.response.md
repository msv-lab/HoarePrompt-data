Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `r` is the input from the user, `v2` is 3, `v1` is 2, `prev` is 1, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0, the user is prompted to enter a string**.

The code `r = input('')` prompts the user to input a string, which is stored in the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
