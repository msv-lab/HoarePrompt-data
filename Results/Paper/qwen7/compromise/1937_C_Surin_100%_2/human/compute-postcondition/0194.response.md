Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 6, `v2` is 3, `v1` is 2, and the value of `r` remains unchanged as it was input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `v2 = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `v2`. The values of `i`, `n`, `v1`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
