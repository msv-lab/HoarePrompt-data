Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is greater than 2 but its exact value is not needed for the print statement.
- `r` is an input string and is currently set to '='.
- `prev` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the print statement. Since `r` is the current value and no other value for `prev` is given, we assume `prev` refers to the previous value of `r`, which would still be '=' if no other information is provided.

Given this information, the print statement will output the following:

Output: **? 3 3 = =**
