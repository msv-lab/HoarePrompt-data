Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 6, `r` is '=', `r2` is an input string**

Explanation: The code `r2 = input('')` takes user input and assigns it to the variable `r2`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged. The value of `r` is specifically given as '=', and this remains unaffected by the new input. Therefore, `r2` now holds the value entered by the user, while the other variables retain their initial states.
