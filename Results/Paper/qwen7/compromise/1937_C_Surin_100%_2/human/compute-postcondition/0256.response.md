Output State: **The loop will execute until all possible comparisons are made, with `i` reaching `n`, `n` being at least 6, `v2` being `n-1`, `v1` being `n-1`, and `prev` being `n-1`.**

In this final state, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value of `n`, indicating that all iterations of the inner loops have been executed. The variable `n` will be at least 6, as it needs to be large enough to go through all the iterations specified in the conditions. The variables `v2` and `v1` will both be `n-1`, as they are set to `i` in the last iteration of the loops. Lastly, `prev` will also be `n-1`, as it is updated to `i` in the last iteration when `r` is `'> '` or when the final comparison results in `prev` being updated to `i`.
