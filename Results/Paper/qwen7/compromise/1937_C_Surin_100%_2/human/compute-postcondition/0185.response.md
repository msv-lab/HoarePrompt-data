Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop. In this case, the loop head involves `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 6
   - `v2` is 1
   - `v1` is 1
   - `r` is currently equal to '<'

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, making `i` equal to 2.
   - Therefore, `n` must still be at least 6 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains at least 6.
   - `v2`, `v1`, and `r` are not part of the loop head and thus their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 6, `v2` is 1, `v1` is 1, and the current value of `r` is equal to '<'**
