Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `r` is '=', no changes were made to the variables by the code.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables. It only flushes the output buffer, which means it ensures that all pending output is written to the standard output. Since no variables are modified by this operation, their values remain unchanged.
