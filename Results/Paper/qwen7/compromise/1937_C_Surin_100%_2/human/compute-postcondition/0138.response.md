Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (since `range(1, n)` means `i` takes values from `1` to `n-1`).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `3` and `n` is greater than `2`.

3. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `4`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than `4` because the loop condition is `1 <= i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `4` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` must be greater than `4` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4**.
