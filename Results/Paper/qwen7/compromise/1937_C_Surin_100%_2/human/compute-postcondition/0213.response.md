Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 6, `r` is an input string, and the string `r` is equal to '=', no changes made by `sys.stdout.flush()`**.

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call does not change the values of any variables. It only ensures that any buffered output is written to the console immediately. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
