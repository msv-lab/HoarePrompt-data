Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the middle digit `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`, which would form a peak according to the problem description. For example, if the input is `4 5 7`, the program incorrectly outputs `STAIR` instead of `STAIR`. This is because the condition `max(a, b, c) == b` is not sufficient to cover all peak cases. Specifically, it should also check if `b > a` and `b > c`.

A corrected version of the program should include a proper check for both stair and peak conditions:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < c < b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

func()
```
