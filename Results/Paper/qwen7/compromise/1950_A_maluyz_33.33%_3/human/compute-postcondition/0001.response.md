Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < t`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state of `t` and `i` to ensure the loop can execute.

- **Initial Value of `i`**: Since `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
- **Value of `t`**: For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. Given the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), we can safely assume `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to start.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be at least 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` must be at least 1**
