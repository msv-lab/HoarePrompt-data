Output State: The output state will consist of strings printed during each iteration of the loop based on the comparison of three integers (`a`, `b`, and `c`) entered for each iteration. Specifically, for each line of input, if `a < b < c`, it prints 'STAIR'; if `a == b == c`, it prints 'NONE'; if `max(a, b, c) == b`, it prints 'PEAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. This process repeats `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input.
