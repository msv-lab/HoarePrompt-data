Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) fit the "first-k-th" settling pattern.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) must fit within one of these repeating patterns.
   - The key insight is that \( n \) modulo \( 2k-2 \) should match the position of \( x \) within the repeating pattern.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It checks two conditions using `func_1` to find possible values of \( k \).
   - The function `func_1` finds all divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) and returns them in a specific order.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly identifies all divisors of a given number \( x \) and returns them in a specific order.
   - This is used to determine potential values of \( k \) by checking if \( x \) fits within the repeating pattern defined by \( k \).

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in the main loop is correct in terms of checking the conditions and collecting valid \( k \) values.
   - The use of `func_1` to find divisors is appropriate and necessary for determining \( k \).

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
