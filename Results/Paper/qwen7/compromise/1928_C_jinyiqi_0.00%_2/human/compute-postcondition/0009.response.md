Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `output1` is a list containing 1 and 3, `output2` is a list containing the integer value of `x / 2`**

Explanation: The code `output1.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is initially 2) to the list `output1`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The values of `x`, `n`, `output1`, and `output2` remain as per the initial state except that `output1` now contains 1 and 3.
