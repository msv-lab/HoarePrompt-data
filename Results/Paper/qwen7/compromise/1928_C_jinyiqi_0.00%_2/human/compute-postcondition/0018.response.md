Output State: **Postcondition: `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is greater than or equal to the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `x`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` from 1 up to the largest divisor less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\), `output2` is a list containing the corresponding quotients when `x` is divided by each divisor in `output1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `output1` will contain all the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` will contain the corresponding quotients when `x` is divided by each of these divisors. The variable `i` will be set to the smallest integer greater than the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x`.
