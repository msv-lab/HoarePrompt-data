State: **`test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `test_cases` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `test_cases`.
2. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `test_cases`.
3. Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0 (the starting value for the `range` function).
4. `test_cases` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute even once.
5. The state of `answers` being an empty list is not directly related to the loop's execution but is mentioned in the problem statement.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `test_cases` (to ensure the loop can execute) and `i` (to match the starting value of the loop).
