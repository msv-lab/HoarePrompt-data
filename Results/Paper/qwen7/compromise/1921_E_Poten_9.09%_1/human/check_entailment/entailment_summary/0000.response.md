Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the rules of the game and outputs the expected results for the provided test cases.

1. **Initial Conditions Check**: The program correctly checks if the initial positions of Alice and Bob are in the same row or if Alice is in the first row (which would result in a draw).
2. **Parity Check**: The program checks the parity (even or odd nature) of the initial positions of Alice and Bob. This is crucial because it helps determine who can force a win under optimal play.
3. **Relative Position Analysis**: The program analyzes the relative positions of Alice and Bob, considering their initial coordinates and the constraints of their movements. It correctly handles different scenarios where Alice and Bob are in different rows and calculates whether Alice or Bob can force a win.
4. **Output Handling**: The program correctly appends the appropriate outcome ('Draw', 'Bob', 'Alice') to the `answers` list and prints it after processing all test cases.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the game outcome based on the provided rules and test cases. The conditions and logic seem to align with the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
