t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the list of integers a (of length n) represents the initial number of stones in each pile, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
