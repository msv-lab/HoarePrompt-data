Output State: **`cw` is True, `nums` is a list of integers where each element has been decremented by the cumulative sum of all previous elements in `nums`, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`.**

Explanation: The code `cw = True` simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `cw`. This does not affect the values of `nums` or `ls`. Therefore, the values of `nums` and `ls` remain unchanged from their initial state.
