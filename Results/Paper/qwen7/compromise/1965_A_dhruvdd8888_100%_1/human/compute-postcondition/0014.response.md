Based on the initial state provided:

- `cw` is `False`.
- `nums` is a list of integers where each element has been decremented by the cumulative sum of all previous elements in `nums`.
- `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`.
- The `if` condition `(cw)` is `False`.

Given that the `if` condition `(cw)` is `False`, the code inside the `if` block will not be executed. Therefore, the `print('Alice')` statement will not be executed because the condition is not met.

Output: **nothing**
