Output State: `cw` is False, `nums` is a list of integers where each element has been decremented by the cumulative sum of all previous elements in `nums`, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`.

Explanation: The loop iterates from the second last element to the second element of the `nums` list. For each element, if it equals 1, `cw` is toggled; otherwise, `cw` remains True. Since the loop starts from the end and moves towards the beginning, and given that the value of `cw` at the start of the loop is True, it will be toggled for every 1 found in the `nums` list. If there is an odd number of 1s, `cw` will end up being False; if even, it would be True. However, since we do not know the exact number of 1s in the list, we can only definitively say that `cw` will be False if there was at least one 1 and the total number of 1s was odd. The `nums` and `ls` values remain as per the initial state because the loop does not modify these variables.
