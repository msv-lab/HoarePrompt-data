### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - **Input**: The function takes no input parameters but reads from standard input.
   - **Pile Representation**: The input consists of a number `N` followed by `N` space-separated integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile.
   - **Processing**:
     - The input strings are split and converted to integers, and a '0' is added to the set `nums`.
     - The set `nums` is then sorted, and a cumulative sum `ls` is calculated.
     - Each element in `nums` is decremented by `ls`.
     - The function then iterates through the sorted list `nums` from the second last element to the second element, checking if any element is equal to 1.
     - The variable `cw` is toggled based on the presence of 1s in the list.
     - Finally, the function prints 'Alice' if `cw` is True, otherwise it prints 'Bob'.

2. **Key Issues**:
   - **Incorrect Pile Handling**: The program does not handle the game logic correctly. Specifically, it does not ensure that the removal of stones is limited by the smallest nonempty pile in each turn.
   - **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: The cumulative sum `ls` is used to decrement the piles, which is not aligned with the game rules. The game requires removing stones from all piles simultaneously, not just decrementing by a cumulative sum.
   - **Toggling Logic**: The logic for toggling `cw` based on the presence of 1s is flawed. The game's outcome depends on the parity of the number of piles with exactly one stone after each move, but the current implementation does not correctly simulate the game's turns.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3
     2
     2 1
     ```
     According to the game rules, Alice can remove 1 stone from the pile of size 2, making it 1, and the game ends because Bob cannot make a move. Therefore, Alice should win.
   - However, the program incorrectly handles this scenario and would not correctly determine the winner based on the given logic.

4. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not follow the game rules. The provided solution does not account for the restriction of removing stones up to the size of the smallest nonempty pile in each turn.
   - The annotated code further confirms that the program's logic is flawed and does not simulate the game correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement.

**Final: False**
