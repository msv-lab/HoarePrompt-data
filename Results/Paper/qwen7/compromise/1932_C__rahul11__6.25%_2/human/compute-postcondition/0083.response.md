Output State: **`k` is 2, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[1] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `n` is the number of elements in the array, `r` is decremented by 1 if `s[k]` is not 'L', `c` is incremented by 1, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`**

Explanation: The code `res[c] = ans % m % MOD` updates the value of `res[c]` to be the result of `ans % m % MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
