Postcondition: `c` is 4 or 5; `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`; `m` is an integer entered by the user; `arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least three elements; `s` is a list of characters from an input string; `ans` is adjusted according to whether `s[2]` is 'L' or not; `i` is the last or second last element of `arr`; `l` is 4 or 2 or 3 or 1; `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 2` or `n - 3`; `k` is 2; if `s[2]` is 'L', `res[c]` remains unchanged and `ans` is adjusted accordingly; otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r-1] % MOD` and `r` is decreased by 1.
