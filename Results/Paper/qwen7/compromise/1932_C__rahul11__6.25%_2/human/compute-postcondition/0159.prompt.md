Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; the array `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all i; the string `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `MOD` is 1000000006.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(input())
    res = [0] * n
    ans = 1
    for i in arr:
        ans *= i
    res[0] = ans % m % MOD
    c = 1
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for k in range(n - 1):
        if s[k] == 'L':
            ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
            res[c] = ans % m % MOD
            l += 1
        else:
            ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
            res[c] = ans % m % MOD
            r -= 1
        c += 1
    print(*res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `k` will be `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` will be the result of repeatedly dividing it by elements in `arr` based on the direction specified in `s`, `l` will be `n`, `r` will be `-1`, `res[c]` will contain the final value of `ans % m % MOD`, and `c` will be `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `k` will be `n-2`, `ans` will be `ans // arr[l] % MOD` or `ans // arr[r] % MOD` depending on the last operation, `res[c]` will be the final value of `ans % m % MOD`, `n` will be the number of elements in the array, `l` will be `n-1`, `r` will be 0, and `c` will be `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `c` is equal to `n`, `res[c-1]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least three elements, `s` is a list of characters from an input string, `ans` is the result of repeatedly dividing it by elements of `arr` based on the direction specified by `s`, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `l` is `n-1`, `r` is 0, `k` is `n-1`.

This means after the loop completes all its iterations, the counter `c` will be equal to the length of the string `s`, indicating that the loop has executed `n-1` times (since `k` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-2`). The variable `res` will contain `n` elements, with the last element being the final value of `ans` after all divisions have been performed. The value of `ans` will be the product of all elements in `arr` divided by the elements specified in `s` in the order they appear, modulo `MOD`. The pointers `l` and `r` will point to the start and end of the list `arr`, respectively, indicating that all elements in `arr` have been processed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
