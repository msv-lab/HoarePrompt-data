Output State: **`n` is 1, `m` is the second integer input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(input())` takes a new string input from the user and converts it into a list of characters. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `arr` remains as a list of integers obtained from the previous input.
