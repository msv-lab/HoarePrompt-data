Output State: **`k` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `l` is 2, `r` is `r - 1`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Initially, `l` was 1, so after executing the code, `l` becomes 2. The values of `k`, `n`, `ans`, `r`, `res[c]`, and `MOD` remain unchanged from their initial states.
