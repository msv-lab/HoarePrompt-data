Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
2. The main issues are:
   - The initial product calculation (`ans`) is only computed once before the loop starts, which means it does not update with each removal of an element from the array.
   - The program uses `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6` instead of the given `m` for the modulo operation, which is incorrect.
   - The program does not handle the case where the product becomes zero after an early division, leading to incorrect results.
   - The program does not reset the product (`ans`) after each command, causing incorrect results for subsequent operations.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly process the commands and compute the required remainders.

Correctness: **False**
