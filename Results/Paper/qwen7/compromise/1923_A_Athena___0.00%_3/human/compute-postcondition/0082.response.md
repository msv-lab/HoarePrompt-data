Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `a` is not empty (`a`) and the first element of `a` is 0 (`a[0] == 0`).

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is 0 (this state is not directly relevant to the loop condition).
   - `i` is the index of the last remaining element in the list `a`.
   - `len(a)` is the length of the list `a` with the first element removed.
   - `t` is 0 (this state is not directly relevant to the loop condition).

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition involves two parts: `a` is not empty and `a[0] == 0`.
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true.
   - Since `a` is not empty, `len(a)` should still be greater than 0.
   - For `a[0] == 0` to be true, the first element of `a` must still be 0.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `len(a)` must be greater than 0.
   - `a[0]` must be 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `len(a)` and `a[0]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`res` is 0, `i` is the index of the last remaining element in the list `a`, `len(a)` must be greater than 0, and `a[0]` must be 0**.
