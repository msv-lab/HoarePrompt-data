Output State: **`res` is 1, `i` is 0, `len(a)` is the length of the original list `a` with all leading zeros removed, the current value of `a[i]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Initially, `res` is 0, so after executing this line, `res` becomes 1. The other variables (`i` and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
