Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list with its first element being 1, `i` is the index of the last iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Initially, the first element of `a` is 0. After executing the code, the first element of `a` becomes 1 (since the first element is removed and the next element, which is 1, moves to the first position). The values of `res`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
