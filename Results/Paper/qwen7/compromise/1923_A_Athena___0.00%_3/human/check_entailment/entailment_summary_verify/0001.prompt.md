You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (number of cells), and a list of `n` integers indicating whether each cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1). For each test case, it removes leading zeros from the list, counts the remaining leading zeros across all test cases, and prints the final list after removing leading zeros. The function then prints the total count of leading zeros removed from all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of cells and a list of integers `a` indicating whether each cell contains a chip (1) or is free (0).

2. **Initial Processing:**
   - The program removes leading zeros (free cells at the beginning) using `while a and a[0] == 0: a.pop(0)`.
   - It also removes trailing zeros (free cells at the end) using `while a and a[-1] == 0: a.pop()`.

3. **Counting Operations:**
   - The program initializes `res` to 0, which will be used to count the number of operations needed.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and increments `res` every time it encounters a free cell (0).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the list `a` after processing (which should now start with at least one chip and end with no free cells).
   - It prints the value of `res`, which is supposed to be the minimum number of operations required.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Operations:**
   - The logic to count the number of operations is flawed. The program simply counts the number of free cells in the processed list `a`. However, the problem requires moving chips to the closest free cell to the left, not just counting free cells.
   - For example, in the input `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]`, the program would remove leading and trailing zeros and then count the free cells, resulting in `res = 2` instead of `1`.

2. **Output of Processed List:**
   - While printing the processed list `a` is unnecessary and does not affect correctness, it is not aligned with the problem statement's requirement to output the minimum number of operations.

### Correct Solution

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the process of moving chips to the closest free cell to the left until all chips form a single block. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the first chip
        first_chip_index = next(i for i, x in enumerate(a) if x == 1)
        
        # Initialize the result counter
        res = 0
        
        # Iterate through the array starting from the first chip
        for i in range(first_chip_index, n):
            if a[i] == 1:
                # Find the closest free cell to the left
                j = i - 1
                while j >= 0 and a[j] == 0:
                    j -= 1
                if j < 0:
                    break
                # Move the chip to the closest free cell
                res += i - j - 1
                # Mark the current cell as free
                a[i] = 0
                a[j + 1] = 1
        
        print(res)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the process of moving chips to the closest free cell to the left. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
