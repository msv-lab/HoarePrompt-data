The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it calculates a value `ans` based on the number of cards (`n`), the number of operations allowed (`k`), and the initial distribution of card types (`a`). It then appends each calculated `ans` value to a list `ans_list`. After processing all test cases, it prints each value in `ans_list`. The final state of the program is that `ans_list` contains the calculated `ans` values for each test case, and these values are printed out.
