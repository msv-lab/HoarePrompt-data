Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is a non-negative integer, `n` must be at least 1, `ans` remains unchanged, `k` is either decreased by `dif * (i + 1) * 2` or set to 0, `dif` is the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1. If `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, then `res` is decreased by 7; otherwise, `res` is decreased by 5 plus the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`.
