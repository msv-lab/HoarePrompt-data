Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input.**

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state required the input to be a positive integer to continue the loop, which is now satisfied as `n` and `k` hold the values of the input integers. All other variables remain unaffected, and the precondition that the input must be a positive integer to continue the loop is now met with `n` and `k` holding the respective integer values from the input.
