Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `k` is an integer, `ans` is `ans + k // (i + 1)`, `res` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, and `n` must be at least 1. The difference (`dif`) between consecutive elements in the list `a` is not equal to 0, and `(k < dif * (i + 1))`. The current value of `i` is not 0.
