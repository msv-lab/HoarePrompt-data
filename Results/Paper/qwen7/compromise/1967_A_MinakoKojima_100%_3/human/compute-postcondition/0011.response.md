Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the first element of the list `a`, `res` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, and `n` must be at least 1. If the difference (`dif`) between consecutive elements in the list `a` is 0, `res` is further decreased by 1.**
