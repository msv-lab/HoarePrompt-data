You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}. The list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}, representing the number of cards of type i initially.
def func():
    ans_list = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        ans = a[0]
        
        res = n - 1
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
            if dif == 0:
                res -= 1
            if dif != 0:
                if k >= dif * (i + 1):
                    ans += dif
                    k -= dif * (i + 1)
                    res -= 1
                else:
                    ans += k // (i + 1)
                    if i != 0:
                        res += k % (i + 1)
                    k = 0
                    break
                if k == 0:
                    break
        
        if k != 0:
            ans += k // n
            res += k % n
        
        ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
        
        ans += res
        
        ans_list.append(ans)
        
    #State: `ans_list` contains the sum of `ans` values calculated for each iteration, with each `ans` value being computed based on the logic within the loop. The final `ans` value after all iterations is the last element in `ans_list`.
    for a in ans_list:
        print(a)
        
    #State: Output State: `ans_list` must have as many elements as there are iterations of the loop, with each element being the value of `a` from each respective iteration of the loop.
    #
    #In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans_list` will contain a list where each element corresponds to the value of `a` printed during each iteration of the loop. The length of `ans_list` will be equal to the total number of iterations the loop ran.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, n, k, and a, where t is an integer between 1 and 100, n and k are integers with specific ranges, and a is a list of n integers. It returns a value based on the given conditions and inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
