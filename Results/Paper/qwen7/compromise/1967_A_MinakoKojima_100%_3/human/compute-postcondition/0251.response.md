Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `res` is -3, `k` is `k - dif * 3`, and `ans` is `2 * dif`. Otherwise, `res` is -1, `k` is 0, and `ans` is either `dif` or 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
