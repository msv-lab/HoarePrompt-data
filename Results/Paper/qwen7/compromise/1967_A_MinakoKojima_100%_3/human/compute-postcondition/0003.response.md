Output State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user split by space, `k` is an integer input by the user split by space and converted to int.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `a`. The variable `k` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
