Output State: **`i` is `x + 2`, `n` is `y`, `dif` is `a[a[i + 1] - a[i]]`, `ans` is `ans + dif`, `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated by subtracting `dif * (i + 1)` from its current value. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `dif`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
