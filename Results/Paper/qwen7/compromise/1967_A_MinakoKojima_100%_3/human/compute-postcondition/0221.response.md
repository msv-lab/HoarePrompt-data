Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is -2, `k` is `-dif * 2`, `ans` is `dif`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `k` by subtracting `dif * (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 1, `i + 1` equals 2. So, `k` is updated to `-dif * 2`. The values of `n`, `res`, `dif`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
