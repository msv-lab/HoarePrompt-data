Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is -2, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0**

Explanation: The line `res -= 1` subtracts 1 from the current value of `res`. Given that `res` was initially `-1`, after executing this line, `res` becomes `-2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
