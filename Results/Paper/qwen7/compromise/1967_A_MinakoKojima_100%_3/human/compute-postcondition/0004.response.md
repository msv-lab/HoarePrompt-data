Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user split by space, `k` is an integer input by the user split by space and converted to int.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `k` remain unchanged as it is not affected by the sorting operation. The initial state of `a` being a list of integers input by the user and `k` being an integer input by the user are preserved, but now `a` is sorted.
