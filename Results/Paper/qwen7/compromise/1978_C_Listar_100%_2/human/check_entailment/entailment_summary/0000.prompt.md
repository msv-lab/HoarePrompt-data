Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

    8 14
    
    112 777
    
    5 12
    
    5 2

    Yes
    3 1 2
    No
    Yes
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7

    8 2 3 4 5 6 1 7
    No
    Yes
    5 4 3 1 2
    Yes
    2 1 3 4 5
    
Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
T = int(input())
for i in range(T):
    func_6()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    c = 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -2):
        c += 1
        if k == 0:
            return l
        if k < i - 1:
            return func_2(c, k, l)
        k = k - i + 1
        l = func_3(c, l)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer between 1 and 200,000) and `k` (an integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000). It reduces `k` by half, initializes a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n`, and iterates over `l` in reverse order. If `k` becomes zero, it returns the list `l`. If `k` is less than the current index minus one, it calls another function `func_2` with parameters `c`, `k`, and `l`. Otherwise, it updates `k` and calls `func_3` with parameters `c` and `l`, then updates `l`. Finally, the function returns a modified list `l` where `c` is set to 1, `k` is zero, and `l` contains integers from 1 to `n`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(c, k, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[-c - k])
    (l[-c], l[-c - k]) = (y, x)
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `c` (a non-negative integer less than the length of the list `l`), `k` (a non-negative integer), and `l` (a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`). After swapping the elements at indices `-c` and `-c - k` in the list `l`, it returns the modified list `l`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(c, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[c - 1])
    (l[c - 1], l[-c]) = (x, y)
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function accepts two parameters: `c`, a positive integer within the range 1 to half the length of the list `l`, and `l`, a list of integers representing a permutation. It swaps the elements at index `c-1` and the last element of the list (`-c`), then returns the modified list `l`.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if k % 2:
        return (0, 0)
    if n % 2:
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else:
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    if max_k < k:
        return (0, 0)
    return (n, k)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( 0 \leq k \leq 10^{12} \). It then checks if \( k \) is odd and returns (0, 0) if true. Next, it calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \) and checks if it is less than \( k \). If so, it returns (0, 0). Otherwise, it returns \( n \) and the adjusted even value of \( k \).
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(l):
    print('YES')
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    return
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function accepts a list of integers `l` representing positions in a permutation of length `n`. It prints 'YES' followed by the integers in `l` separated by spaces, then prints an empty line. The function does not return any value.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    (n, k) = func_4()
    if n == 0:
        print('NO')
        return
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_5(l)
    return
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function accepts no parameters and returns either `None` or the value of `l`, which is the result of calling `func_5(l)` with the input `l` that itself is the result of `func_1(n, k)`, where `n` and `k` are both the results of calling `func_4()`. If `n` is 0, the function prints 'NO' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it proceeds to compute `l` and then returns its value.
