### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \).
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |p_i - i| \).

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**
   - **func_4()**: This function checks if \( k \) is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \). It returns \( (0, 0) \) if \( k \) is odd or if \( k \) exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value.
   - **func_1()**: This function attempts to construct a permutation with the required Manhattan value. It uses a recursive approach with helper functions `func_2()` and `func_3()`.
   - **func_2()** and **func_3()**: These functions swap elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - **func_5()**: This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation.
   - **func_6()**: This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4()` and `func_1()`, and then calls `func_5()` to print the result.

3. **Verification of Correctness:**
   - **func_4()**: Ensures \( k \) is even and within the valid range. If \( k \) is odd or exceeds the maximum possible value, it returns invalid values.
   - **func_1()**: Constructs the permutation by recursively swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value. The logic seems to handle even and odd \( n \) correctly.
     - The function starts by reducing \( k \) by half, which is a crucial step because the Manhattan value of a permutation is always even.
     - It initializes a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n`.
     - It iterates over the list in reverse order, adjusting the Manhattan value by swapping elements.
     - If `k` becomes zero, it returns the list `l`.
     - If `k` is less than the current index minus one, it calls `func_2()` to swap elements.
     - Otherwise, it updates `k` and calls `func_3()` to swap elements.
   - **func_2()** and **func_3()**: Swap elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value, ensuring the permutation remains valid.
   - **func_5()**: Correctly prints the permutation if found.
   - **func_6()**: Properly handles the input and calls the necessary functions to solve the problem.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases like odd \( k \), odd \( n \), and when \( k \) exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value.
   - The recursive approach in `func_1()` ensures that the permutation is built correctly by adjusting the Manhattan value through swaps.

5. **Detailed Analysis of func_1():**
   - The function correctly reduces \( k \) by half initially, which is essential because the Manhattan value of a permutation is always even.
   - The loop iterates over the list in reverse order, starting from the largest index.
   - The function handles the case where `k` becomes zero by returning the list `l`.
   - The function handles the case where `k` is less than the current index minus one by calling `func_2()`, which swaps elements to reduce the Manhattan value.
   - The function handles the general case by updating `k` and calling `func_3()`, which swaps elements to further adjust the Manhattan value.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to find a permutation with the specified Manhattan value or determine that no such permutation exists.
   - The recursive approach in `func_1()` ensures that the permutation is built correctly by adjusting the Manhattan value through swaps.
   - The overall structure and logic of the code are sound and handle various edge cases appropriately.
