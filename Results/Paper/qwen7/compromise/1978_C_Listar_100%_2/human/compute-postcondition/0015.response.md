Postcondition: `n` is an integer, `k` is an even integer obtained from the second input split, and `max_k` is the maximum value between `n` and `k`. If `n` is even, `max_k` is simply `n`; if `n` is odd, `max_k` is calculated as `((n // 2) * 2) + 1`. Since the program does not enter the if block and goes to the else block, it means `max_k` is not less than `k`.
