You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, k) is a tuple of two integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and n is an integer such that the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length n is at least k.
def func_4():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (k % 2) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two zeros (0, 0)
    #State: `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, and `k` is even
    if (n % 2) :
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else :
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer, `k` is an even integer obtained from the second input split, and `max_k` is the maximum value between `n` and `k`. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is calculated as `((n // 2) * 2) + 1`. If `n` is even, `max_k` is simply `n`.
    if (max_k < k) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns 0, 0
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer, `k` is an even integer obtained from the second input split, and `max_k` is the maximum value between `n` and `k`. If `n` is even, `max_k` is simply `n`; if `n` is odd, `max_k` is calculated as `((n // 2) * 2) + 1`. Since the program does not enter the if block and goes to the else block, it means `max_k` is not less than `k`.
    return n, k
    #The program returns the integer `n` and the even integer `k` that is either equal to `n` if `n` is even, or the closest even number greater than or equal to `n` if `n` is odd.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but returns either (0, 0), 0, 0, or the integer `n` and the even integer `k` that is either equal to `n` if `n` is even, or the closest even number greater than or equal to `n` if `n` is odd.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns two zeros (0, 0)

Case_2: The program returns 0, 0

Case_3: The program returns the integer `n` and the even integer `k` that is either equal to `n` if `n` is even, or the closest even number greater than or equal to `n` if `n` is odd.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
