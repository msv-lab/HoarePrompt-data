Output State: **`s` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `c` in `s`, `ans` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` reads a line of input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `s`. The counts of each element (`cnt[c]`) and the calculated value of `ans` remain unchanged because they are not modified by this line of code. Variables `t` and `n` also remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
