Output State: **`c` is 0, `cnt[c]` is 1, `ans` is 1**

Explanation: Initially, `c` is 0 and `cnt[c]` (which is `cnt[0]`) is incremented by 1, making `cnt[0]` equal to 1. The code `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` checks if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. Since `cnt[1]` is not mentioned and has not been initialized or modified, it is considered to be 0. Therefore, the condition `cnt[1] > 0` evaluates to `False`, and `ans` is not incremented. However, `ans` was initially 0 before this line of code, so it is incremented by 1, making `ans` equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
