Output State: **`ans` will be the sum of the number of zeros in the list `s` plus the count of ones in `s` minus 1, `cnt` will contain the count of each integer in `s`, `zeroes` will be the initial number of zeros in `s`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input**.

Explanation: The code `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` reads a line of input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, and then maps each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `s`. The initial values of `ans`, `cnt`, `zeroes`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.
