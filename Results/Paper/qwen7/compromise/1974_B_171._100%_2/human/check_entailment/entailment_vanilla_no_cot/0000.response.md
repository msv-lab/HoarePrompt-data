Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and then splits the input into manageable parts. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it correctly extracts the necessary information (length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself).

3. **Decoding Logic**:
   - It first finds all unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - It creates a mapping where each character in the sorted unique list is paired with its corresponding symmetric character.
   - It uses this mapping to decode the entire encoded string.

4. **Output**: The decoded strings are stored and printed out correctly.

Given these points, the program accurately decodes the encoded strings according to the specified algorithm. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
