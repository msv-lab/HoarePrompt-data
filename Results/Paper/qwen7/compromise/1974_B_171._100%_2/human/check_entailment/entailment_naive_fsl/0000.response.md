Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly decodes the encoded string according to the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads multiple test cases efficiently using `sys.stdin.read` and processes them correctly.
2. **Decoding Logic**: 
   - It first extracts the unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically to form the auxiliary string `r`.
   - It then creates a mapping (`char_map`) where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
   - Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the encoded string `b` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding symmetric character from `r`.

Given the examples and the nature of the problem, the program handles all potential cases correctly. For instance:
- Decoding "serofedsoc" to "codeforces".
- Decoding "ttf" to "fft".
- Decoding "tlrhgmaoi" to "algorithm".
- Decoding "w" to "w".
- Decoding "hnndledmnhlttin" to "meetinthemiddle".

Since the program works correctly for all provided examples and the logic aligns with the problem description, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
