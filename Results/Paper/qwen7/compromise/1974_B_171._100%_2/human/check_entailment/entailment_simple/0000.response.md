Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases as described.
2. The function `func_1` is designed to decode a string based on the encoding algorithm provided.
3. It first creates an ordered list of unique characters from the encoded string.
4. It then creates a mapping (`char_map`) where each character is paired with its symmetric counterpart in the list of unique characters.
5. Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the encoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the mapping.
6. The provided state comments and the logic within the function align with the problem description and the expected behavior.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
