Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be non-zero.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 ⋅ 10^4.
   - `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `L` is an empty list.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition is `n`, so we need to ensure that `n` is non-zero for the loop to execute again.
   - We need to check the value of `n` after the previous iteration to determine if it is zero or not.

4. **Calculate the value of `n` after the previous iteration**:
   - The expression for `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
   - Let's denote the value of `n` before the previous iteration as `n_prev`.
   - After the previous iteration, `n` becomes `n_prev - (n_prev + 1) // 2`.

5. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must be non-zero.
   - Therefore, `n_prev - (n_prev + 1) // 2` must be non-zero.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `n` is derived from `n_prev`, we need to ensure that `n_prev` is such that `n_prev - (n_prev + 1) // 2` is non-zero.
   - This means `n_prev` must be greater than 1 because if `n_prev` is 1, then `n_prev - (n_prev + 1) // 2 = 1 - 1 = 0`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `n` must be non-zero after the previous iteration, which means `n_prev` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `_` is 1, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
