`L` must contain at least three elements, `pow` is 16, `tot` is the sum of the first three elements of `L`, and `k` is further decreased by `tot`. The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `L`, `pow`, and `tot` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`L` must contain at least three elements, `pow` is 16, `tot` is the sum of the first three elements of `L`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the original value of `k` decreased by `tot`.**
