You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        L = []
        
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
        
        tot = 0
        
        pow = 1
        
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
                break
            tot += a
            k -= tot
            pow *= 2
        
    #State: Output State: `L` contains at least `t` elements, `pow` is equal to \(2^t\), `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, and `k` is reduced to a value that is no longer less than or equal to the sum of any remaining elements in `L`.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, `L` will contain at least as many elements as the input integer `t`. The variable `pow` will be equal to \(2^t\) because it doubles with each iteration of the loop. `tot` will be the sum of all elements in the list `L` since it accumulates the values of `a` in each iteration. Finally, `k` will be reduced to a value that is no longer less than or equal to the sum of any remaining elements in `L`, meaning that the loop has processed all elements in `L` and `k` has been fully consumed or adjusted according to the loop's logic.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers n and k within each test case where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. It returns a value based on the relationship between n and k.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
