Output State: **`k` is now `k - tot`, `pow` is 1, `m` is 0, `tot` is equal to `k - a` if `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, otherwise `tot` remains unchanged, and `n` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `k -= tot` subtracts the value of `tot` from `k`. The other variables (`pow`, `m`, `tot`, and `n`) remain unchanged. The value of `tot` is described in the initial state and does not get updated by this operation.
