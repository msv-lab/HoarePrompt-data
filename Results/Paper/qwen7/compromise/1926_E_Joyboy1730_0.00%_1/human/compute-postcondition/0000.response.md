Output State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) remains valid after the code execution. The other information about the test cases consisting of two integers `n` and `k` such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9\) is not affected by this code and thus is not included in the output state.
