Output State: **`L` must have at least two elements, `a` is the next element from `L`, `k` is decreased by `tot + a`, `pow` is multiplied by 4, `tot` is now `tot + a`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pow *= 2` multiplies the value of `pow` by 2. Since `pow` was previously multiplied by 2 (as per the initial state), it is now multiplied by 4. The other variables (`L`, `a`, `k`, and `tot`) remain unchanged according to the provided initial state.
