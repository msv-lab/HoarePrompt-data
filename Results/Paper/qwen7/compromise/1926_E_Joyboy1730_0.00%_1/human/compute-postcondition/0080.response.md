Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k` is now `k - (tot + a)`: This means `k` is updated to its current value minus the sum of `tot` and `a`.
   - `pow` is 4: This is a constant value.
   - `m` is 0: This is another constant value.
   - `tot` is 0: This is a constant value.
   - `a` is the next element in the list `L`: Since `a` is the next element in the list `L`, it must be the first element of `L` because no other elements have been mentioned yet.
   - `n` is 1: This is another constant value.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
   ```

3. **Calculating `k`:**
   - From the initial state, we know `a` is the first element of `L`.
   - Therefore, `k` is updated to `k - (tot + a) = k - (0 + a) = k - a`.

4. **Substituting into the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement becomes `print(4 * (2 * (k - a) - 1))`.
   - Simplifying inside the parentheses: `2 * (k - a) - 1 = 2k - 2a - 1`.
   - So, the expression becomes `4 * (2k - 2a - 1) = 8k - 8a - 4`.

Given the initial state and the formula, the print statement will output the result of `8k - 8a - 4`.

Output: **8k - 8a - 4**
