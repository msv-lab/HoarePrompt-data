Based on the initial state provided:

- `L` must have at least one element.
- `tot` is less than `k`.
- `k` is less than or equal to `tot` plus the value of `a`.

However, the values of `pow`, `k`, and `a` are not explicitly given. Therefore, we cannot determine their exact values. 

Given this, the expression `pow * (2 * k - 1)` involves `pow`, which is not defined in the initial state, and `k` and `a` whose values are not specified. 

Output: **pow * (2 * k - 1) (where pow, k, and a are undefined based on the given initial state)**
