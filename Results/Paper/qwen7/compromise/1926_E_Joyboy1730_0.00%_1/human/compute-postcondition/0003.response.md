Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 5 â‹… 10^4, inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `_` is 1**

The code initializes an empty list `L`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `_`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
