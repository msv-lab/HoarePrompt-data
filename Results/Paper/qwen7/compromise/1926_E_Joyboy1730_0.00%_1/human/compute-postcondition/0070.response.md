Output State: **`k` is now `k - tot`, `pow` is 2, `m` is 0, `tot` is equal to `k - a` if `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, otherwise `tot` remains unchanged, and `n` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `pow *= 2` multiplies the current value of `pow` by 2. Given that `pow` was initially set to 1, after executing this line, `pow` becomes 2. The other variables (`k`, `m`, `tot`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
