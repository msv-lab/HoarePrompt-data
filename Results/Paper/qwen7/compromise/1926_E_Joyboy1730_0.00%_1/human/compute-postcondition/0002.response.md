Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 5 â‹… 10^4, inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `_` is 1**

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `_` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state.
