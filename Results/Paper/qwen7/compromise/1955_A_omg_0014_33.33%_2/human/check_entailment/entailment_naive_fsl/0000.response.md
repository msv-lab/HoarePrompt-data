Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all potential cases. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the cost when the promotion price for two yogurts (b) is less than half the regular price of one yogurt (a/2). 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
3 5 11
```
According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would be to buy three yogurts under the promotion, which costs 15 burles (3 * 11 / 2 = 16.5, rounded down to 15). However, the program checks if `a * b < a * d` where `d = c / 2`, and since `5 * 11 < 5 * 5.5` is false, it prints `5 * 5 = 25`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should check if buying in pairs (promotion) is cheaper than buying individually and then adjust the total cost accordingly. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate cost without promotion
        cost_without_promotion = n * a
        # Calculate cost with promotion
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        cost_with_promotion = pairs * b + remaining * a
        # Print the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(cost_without_promotion, cost_with_promotion))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly for all potential cases.
