Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `n` times, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case.

2. **Calculating the Cost:**
   - The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`. This seems to be an attempt to use the promotion price per yogurt (`c / 2`).
   - The program then checks if the cost of buying yogurts individually (`a * b`) is less than the cost of buying them in pairs using the promotion (`a * d`).

3. **Output:**
   - If the individual cost is cheaper, it prints `a * b`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`.

### Analysis:
- The logic in the program is flawed because it does not correctly handle the scenario where buying in pairs (promotion) might be cheaper overall.
- The program incorrectly compares the cost of buying one yogurt at a time with the cost of buying half a pair of yogurts, which is not a valid comparison.
- The program does not account for the optimal strategy of buying as many pairs as possible and then handling any remaining yogurts individually.

### Example Analysis:
- For the first test case (2 5 9): 
  - Individual cost: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
  - Promotion cost: \(2 \times \frac{9}{2} = 9\)
  - The program outputs 9, which is correct.
- For the second test case (3 5 9):
  - Individual cost: \(3 \times 5 = 15\)
  - Promotion cost: \(1 \times 9 + 1 \times 5 = 14\) (buy one pair and one individual)
  - The program outputs 14, which is correct.
- For the third test case (3 5 11):
  - Individual cost: \(3 \times 5 = 15\)
  - Promotion cost: \(1 \times 11 + 1 \times 5 = 16\) (buy one pair and one individual)
  - The program outputs 15, which is correct.
- For the fourth test case (4 5 11):
  - Individual cost: \(4 \times 5 = 20\)
  - Promotion cost: \(2 \times 11 = 22\)
  - The program outputs 20, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 20 (buy two pairs).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
