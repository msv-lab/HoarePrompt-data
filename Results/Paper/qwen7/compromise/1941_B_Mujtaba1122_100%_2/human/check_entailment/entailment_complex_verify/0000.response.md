### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version step-by-step to evaluate the correctness of the program.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
- If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`.
- If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operations.
- It iterates through the array (excluding the first and last elements).
- For each element `i` (where `1 < i < n-1`), it checks if the conditions `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0` are met.
- If the conditions are met, it performs the operation:
  - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
  - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
  - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
- After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero.
- If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES".
- If `func_1` returns `False`, it prints "NO".

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic flow.
- The program reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the result based on the logic implemented in `func_2`.

#### Test Case Analysis:
- Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
  ```
  5
  2 4 4 5 1
  ```
  - Initial array: `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`
  - Operation at `i=2`: `[2, 2, 2, 3, 1]`
  - Operation at `i=2` again: `[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Operation at `i=3`: `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`
  - No further operations can reduce the array to all zeros.

- The program should have printed "NO" for this case, but it prints "YES" due to the incorrect logic in `func_2`.

#### Correctness of the Program:
- The original assessment correctly identified that the program does not handle the case where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros properly.
- The annotated code confirms that the program does not check if the remaining elements can be reduced to zero after each operation.

Given the analysis, the program is indeed incorrect as it fails to handle cases where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly handle cases where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros, as demonstrated by the provided test case.
