### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operations.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2.
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `list[i]` is greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the operation:
     - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
   - If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero after performing the operation, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

### Analysis:

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function correctly checks if all elements in the list are zero. If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`. If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- The function `func_2` iterates through the array and applies the specified operations. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:
  - The operation `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]` should be `list[i+1] -= list[i-1]` to correctly subtract the value of `list[i-1]` once.
  - The operation `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]` is correct.
  - The operation `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]` should be `list[i-1] -= list[i-1]` to set `list[i-1]` to zero.
  
- The condition `while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):` is correct and ensures that the operation is only performed when the conditions are met.
- The function correctly prints 'NO' if `list[i-1]` is not zero after performing the operation and returns immediately.
- After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

### Issues in the Implementation:
- The operations inside the `while` loop need to be corrected to ensure they are applied correctly.
- The operations `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`, `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`, and `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]` should be simplified to `list[i+1] -= list[i-1]`, `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`, and `list[i-1] -= list[i-1]`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= list[i - 1]
        
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('NO')
            return
    
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was accurate in its reasoning but did not address the specific issues in the implementation. The corrected code ensures that the operations are applied correctly, and the program will now work as intended.

### Final: **True**
