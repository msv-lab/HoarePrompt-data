### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotated version to evaluate the correctness of the program.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. It iterates through the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds a non-zero element. If it completes the iteration without finding any non-zero elements, it returns `True`.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros by repeatedly applying the specified operation. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Loop through indices from 1 to n-2**: This ensures we can access both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]`.
2. **While loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`. These conditions ensure that the operation can be applied.
3. **Operation**: 
   - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`: Decrease `list[i + 1]` by `list[i - 1]`.
   - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`: Decrease `list[i]` by `2 * list[i - 1]`.
   - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`: Decrease `list[i - 1]` by `list[i - 1]` (effectively setting it to zero).
4. **Check if `list[i - 1]` is not zero**: If `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the operation, it prints "NO" and returns immediately. This means the operation cannot proceed further.
5. **Post-operation check**: After the loop, if `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic flow. The key points are:
- The function `func_2` correctly applies the operation and checks if the operation can continue.
- The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements are zero.
- The overall logic ensures that the array is reduced to all zeros if possible.

#### Test Case Verification:
Let's verify the logic with the provided test case:
```
5
2 4 4 5 1
```

1. **Initial array**: `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`
2. **First operation at `i=2`**: `[2, 2, 2, 3, 1]`
3. **Second operation at `i=2`**: `[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]`
4. **Third operation at `i=3`**: `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`

Since no further operations can reduce the array to all zeros, the program should correctly output "NO". The annotated code correctly identifies this and prints "NO".

Given the detailed analysis and the correct handling of the test case, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. The original assessment was incorrect, and the program is indeed correct.
