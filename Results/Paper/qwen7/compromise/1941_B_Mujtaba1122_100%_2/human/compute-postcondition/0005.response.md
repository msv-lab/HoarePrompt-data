Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0)`.

2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `list[0]` must be greater than 0.
   - `list[1]` is `-1 * list[0]` (which is `-list[0]`).
   - `list[2]` must be greater than 0.
   - `list[i]` (which is `list[1]`) is `-3 * list[0]`.
   - `list[i-1]` (which is `list[0]`) is 0.

3. **Check the loop condition with the current state**:
   - `list[i] = -3 * list[0]`. For this to be greater than 1, `-3 * list[0]` must be greater than 1. Since `list[0]` must be greater than 0, this implies that `list[0]` must be less than -1/3, but since `list[0]` is an integer, it must be less than -1.
   - `list[i - 1] = list[0]` is 0. This does not satisfy the condition `list[i - 1] > 0`.

Since `list[i - 1]` is 0, the loop condition `list[i - 1] > 0` is not satisfied. Therefore, no adjustment to the loop condition variables (`list[i]`, `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1]`) can make the loop execute again because the condition `list[i - 1] > 0` cannot be met.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1; `list[0]` must be greater than 0; `list[1]` is `-1 * list[0]`; `list[2]` must be greater than 0; `list[i]` (which is `list[1]`) is `-3 * list[0]; `list[i-1]` (which is `list[0]`) is 0.**
