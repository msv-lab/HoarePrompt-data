Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n - 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `list[0]` is -2.
   - `list[1]` is 6.
   - `list[2]` is -3.
   - `list[3]` is 5.
   - `list[4]` is 4.
   - `list[0]` is less than or equal to 0 (This is a condition on the list, but it doesn't affect the loop directly).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 2`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented to 2.

5. **Determine the next value of `n`**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`. Since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3**
