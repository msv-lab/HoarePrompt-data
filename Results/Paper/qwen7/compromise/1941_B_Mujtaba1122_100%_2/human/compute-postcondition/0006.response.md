Output State: **`i` is 1; `list[0]` must be greater than 0; `list[1]` is `-1 * list[0]`; `list[2]` must be greater than 0; `list[3]` is `-3 * list[0] - 1`; `list[1]` is `-1 * list[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` updates `list[i + 1]` (which is `list[2]`) by subtracting `1 * list[i - 1]` (which is `list[0]`) from it. Given that `list[0]` is greater than 0, `list[2]` is initially greater than 0, and `list[0]` is 0, the updated value of `list[2]` is `-3 * list[0] - 1`, which simplifies to `-3 * list[0] - 1` since `list[0]` is 0. Therefore, `list[2]` becomes `-3 * list[0] - 1` or `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
