Output State: `i` is 2; `list[2]` is less than or equal to 0; `list[1]` is 0; `list[3]` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` remains 2 as the condition `list[i] > 1` will eventually fail when `list[2]` becomes less than or equal to 0. The value of `list[2]` keeps decreasing until it reaches 0 or below due to the operations inside the loop. Similarly, `list[1]` and `list[3]` also become 0 because they are used in the subtraction operations and their values get reduced until they reach 0.
