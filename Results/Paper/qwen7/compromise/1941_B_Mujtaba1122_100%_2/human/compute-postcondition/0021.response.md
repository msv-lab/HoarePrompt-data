Output State: **`i` is 2; `list[2]` must be greater than 1; `list[1]` must be greater than 0; `list[3]` must be greater than 0; `list[3]` is decreased by `list[1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `list[i + 1]` by subtracting `1 * list[i - 1]` from it. Given `i` is 2, `list[i + 1]` refers to `list[3]` and `list[i - 1]` refers to `list[1]`. Therefore, `list[3]` is decreased by `list[1]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
