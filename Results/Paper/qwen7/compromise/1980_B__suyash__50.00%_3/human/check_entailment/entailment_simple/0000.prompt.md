Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100 for all i.

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows:
    #
    #- `i` is equal to the length of list `l`.
    #- `a` is the last input string received.
    #- `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `a` and converting each part to an integer.
    #- `o` is a list of strings sorted in reverse order.
    #- `n` is the first element of list `b`.
    #- `f` is the second element of list `b`.
    #- `k` is the third element of list `b` minus the sum of `dic[l[-1]]` and `dic[l[-2]]` (if `l` has at least two elements), otherwise just the third element of list `b`.
    #- `fav` is the element at index `f - 1` of list `o` if `k` is equal to `n`, otherwise no new variables are introduced.
    #- `dic` is a dictionary where keys are elements of list `o` and values are their counts in list `o`.
    #- `l` is a list of unique elements from `o` sorted in reverse order.
    #
    #After all iterations, the loop has completed its execution. Depending on the conditions within the loop, one of the following outputs has been printed: 'NO', 'MAYBE', or 'YES'. If no output was printed, it means the loop did not meet any of the conditions to print 'NO' or 'MAYBE', and thus the final state of `k` reflects the cumulative subtraction of dictionary values corresponding to the elements of `l` from the third element of list `b`.
