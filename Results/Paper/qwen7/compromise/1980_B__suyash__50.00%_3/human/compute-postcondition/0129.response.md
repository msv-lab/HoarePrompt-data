Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1`, which means `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `k` is the third element of list `b` minus `dic[l[i-1]]` minus `dic[l[i]]`.
- `dic` remains unchanged.
- `len(l)` remains unchanged.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will simply print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
