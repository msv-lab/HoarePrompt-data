Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `k` is decreased by `dic[l[i_end + 1]]`, `fav` is not equal to `l[i_end + 1]`**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by the value of `dic[l[i_end + 1]]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition that `fav` is not equal to `l[i_end + 1]` remains true.
