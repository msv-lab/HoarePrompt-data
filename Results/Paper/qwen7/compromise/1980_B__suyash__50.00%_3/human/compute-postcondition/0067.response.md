Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `k` is defined as `k - dic[l[2]]`. However, since `l` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `k`. But we know that `k` is derived from `k` minus the value of `dic[l[2]]`.

Given the print statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

The output will be the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
