Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i_end + 1`
- `k` is decreased by `dic[l[i_end + 1]]`
- `fav` is not equal to `l[i_end + 1]`

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('MAYBE')
```

This statement will print the string `'MAYBE'` regardless of the values of the other variables because the print statement does not depend on any of them. It directly outputs the string `'MAYBE'`.

Output: **MAYBE**
