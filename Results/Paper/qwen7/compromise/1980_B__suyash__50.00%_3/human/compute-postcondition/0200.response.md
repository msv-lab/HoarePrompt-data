Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `k` is decreased by `dic[l[i_end + 1]]`, `fav` is not equal to `l[i_end + 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement has been executed, which would exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within, but it does not change the values of the variables `i`, `k`, and `fav`. They retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
