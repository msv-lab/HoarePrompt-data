Output State: **`fav` is not equal to `l[i]`, `k` is decreased by `dic[l[i]]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `i` is incremented and `k` is updated. The values of `fav`, `l[i]`, `k`, and `i` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed, but the program will now exit the current loop or conditional block.
