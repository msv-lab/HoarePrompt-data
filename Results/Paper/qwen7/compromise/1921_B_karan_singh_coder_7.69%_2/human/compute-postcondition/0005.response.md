Output State: **`s1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `t1` is the number of '1's in the string `t`.**

Explanation: The code `t1 = t.count('1')` counts the number of '1's in the string `t` and assigns the result to the variable `t1`. The values of `s1`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
