Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is 1 (not directly relevant to the loop head)
   - `s1` is the number of '1's in the string `s` (not directly relevant to the loop head)
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (relevant to the loop condition)
   - `s` is an input string (not directly relevant to the loop head)
   - `t1` is the number of '1's in the string `t` (not directly relevant to the loop head)
   - `i` is 0 (relevant to the loop head)

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 1
- `n` must still be greater than 0

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`cnt` is 1, `s1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `t1` is the number of '1's in the string `t`, `i` is 1**
