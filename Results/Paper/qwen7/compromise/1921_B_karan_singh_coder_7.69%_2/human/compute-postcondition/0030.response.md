The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8, and `n` must be greater than 8 for the loop to continue executing.

Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 9. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 9.

State: **`i` is 9, `n` must be greater than 9**
