Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `s1` is the number of '1's in the input string `s`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the newly input string, `t1` is the number of '1's in the string `t`, `i` is 8, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, `t` is the newly input string, `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`**.

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0, which changes its value from the initial state of 6 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged with their initial values or conditions.
