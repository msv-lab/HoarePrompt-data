Postcondition: **`cnt` is `n`, `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`, `s1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `s`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, `s` is the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is `n-1`. If `s1` equals `t1`, then `d` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `d` is updated to `abs(s1 - t1)`**.
