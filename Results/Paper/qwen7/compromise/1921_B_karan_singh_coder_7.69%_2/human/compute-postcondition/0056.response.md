Output State: `cnt` is `n`, `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`, `s1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `s`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, `s` is the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string `t`, `n` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is `n-1`.

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations (from 0 to `n-1`), the variable `cnt` will hold the value `n`. This means that `cnt` has been incremented once for each iteration of the loop, starting from 0. The values of `t1`, `s1`, `d`, `s`, and `t` remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop, and `n` must be a non-negative integer since it represents the number of iterations. The variable `i` will be `n-1` because the loop increments `i` at the start of each iteration and stops when `i` reaches `n-1`.
