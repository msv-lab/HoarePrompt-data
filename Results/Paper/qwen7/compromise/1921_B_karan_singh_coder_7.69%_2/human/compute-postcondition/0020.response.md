Postcondition: **`cnt` is 6, `s1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `n` is equal to 4, `s` is an input string, `t1` is the number of '1's in the string `t`, `i` is 8, and `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, the variable `cnt` remains at 6, `s1` and `t1` represent the number of '1's in strings `s` and `t` respectively, `n` is still 4, `s` is an input string, `i` is 8, and `d` is the absolute difference between the counts of '1's in `s` and `t`.
