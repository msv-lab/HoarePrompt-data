Output State: **`cnt` is 3, `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`, `s1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `s`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, `s` is the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string `t`, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments `cnt` by 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at the same index in string `t`. Given that `i` is 3, `cnt` is incremented by 1 only if `s[3]` is not equal to `t[3]`. Since the initial value of `cnt` was 2, it becomes 3. The values of `t1`, `s1`, `d`, `s`, `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
