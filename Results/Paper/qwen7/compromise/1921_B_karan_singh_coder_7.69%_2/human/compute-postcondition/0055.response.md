Output State: `cnt` is equal to the value of `n`, `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`, `s1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `s`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, `s` is the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string `t`, `n` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is equal to `n-1`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `cnt` will hold the total count of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ, which is equal to the number of iterations `n`. The values of `t1`, `s1`, `d`, `s`, and `t` remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop. The variable `i` will be `n-1` because the loop increments `i` at each iteration and stops when `i` reaches `n-1`. The precondition that `n` must be a non-negative integer remains unchanged.
