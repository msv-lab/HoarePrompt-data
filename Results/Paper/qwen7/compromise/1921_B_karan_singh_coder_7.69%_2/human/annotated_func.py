#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the second line contains a string s of n characters where '1' indicates a cat in the corresponding box and '0' indicates no cat; the third line contains a string f of n characters where '1' indicates the desired presence of a cat in the corresponding box and '0' indicates no cat. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        t = input()
        
        s1 = s.count('1')
        
        t1 = t.count('1')
        
        cnt = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            cnt += s[i] != t[i]
        
        if s1 == t1:
            print(s1 if cnt else 0)
        else:
            d = abs(s1 - t1)
            print((cnt - d) // 2 + d)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to iterate through each test case provided by the input. For each test case, the following conditions will be checked and actions performed:
    #
    #1. Count the number of '1's in the strings `s` and `t` (denoted as `s1` and `t1` respectively).
    #2. Calculate the total number of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ (denoted as `cnt`).
    #3. If `s1` equals `t1`, the output will be `s1` if `cnt` is zero, otherwise, it will be `0`.
    #4. If `s1` does not equal `t1`, calculate the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1` (denoted as `d`), and then compute the final output as `(cnt - d) // 2 + d`.
    #
    #After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output will be determined based on the last test case processed. Specifically, the output will be either the count of '1's in the final string `s` (`s1`), adjusted according to whether the counts of '1's in `s` and `t` are equal or not, as described above.
    #
    #The exact numerical value of the output cannot be determined without knowing the specific inputs for each test case, but the process described above will be followed for each one.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \), a binary string \( s \) of length \( n \) indicating the presence of cats in boxes, and another binary string \( f \) of length \( n \) indicating the desired presence of cats. For each test case, it calculates the number of positions where the actual and desired cat presence differ (\( cnt \)), counts the number of '1's in both strings (\( s1 \) and \( t1 \)), and determines the output based on whether these counts are equal or not. If the counts are equal, the output is \( s1 \) if no differences exist, otherwise, it is \( 0 \). If the counts are not equal, the output is calculated as \( (cnt - d) // 2 + d \), where \( d \) is the absolute difference between \( s1 \) and \( t1 \). The function ultimately prints the result for each test case.
