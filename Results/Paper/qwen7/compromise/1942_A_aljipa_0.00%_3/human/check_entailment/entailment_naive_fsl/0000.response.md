Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array that meets the specified conditions for all potential cases. Specifically, the program generates an array of 1s if `k` equals `n`, an array from `0` to `n-1` if `k` equals `1`, and `-1` otherwise. However, this approach does not guarantee that exactly `k` out of `n` cyclic shifts will be sorted for all values of `n` and `k`.

For instance, consider the test case `n = 3` and `k = 2`. According to the problem description, we need an array such that exactly 2 out of the 3 cyclic shifts are sorted. The program would generate the array `[0, 1, 2]` for this case, but the cyclic shifts are:
1. `[0, 1, 2]` (sorted)
2. `[1, 2, 0]` (not sorted)
3. `[2, 0, 1]` (not sorted)

Here, only one cyclic shift is sorted, not two, so the generated array does not meet the requirement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
