You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        print(*res)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it generates and prints a list based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \). If \( k \) equals \( n \), it prints a list of \( n \) ones. If \( k \) equals 1, it prints a list containing numbers from 0 to \( n-1 \). In all other cases, it prints -1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to generate an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of its `n` cyclic shifts are sorted. If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then generates a result list `res` based on the values of `k` and `n`:
     - If `k == n`, it sets `res` to `[1] * n`. This means every cyclic shift would be sorted.
     - If `k == 1`, it sets `res` to `range(n)`. This means only one specific cyclic shift will be sorted.
     - Otherwise, it sets `res` to `[-1]`, indicating no valid array can be found.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - For `k == n`: The array `[1] * n` ensures that every cyclic shift is sorted because all elements are the same.
   - For `k == 1`: The array `range(n)` ensures that only one specific cyclic shift is sorted. For example, for `n = 3`, the array `[0, 1, 2]` has only one sorted cyclic shift `[0, 1, 2]`.
   - For other values of `k`: The logic correctly outputs `-1` because no such array can exist where exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted for `k < n`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly by ensuring that only valid arrays are generated.
   - The constraints are also respected since the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^3\).

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
