Postcondition: `extroverts` is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, and `universals` is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and `extroverts % 3 + universals` is greater than or equal to 3, then the condition `extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3` holds true.
