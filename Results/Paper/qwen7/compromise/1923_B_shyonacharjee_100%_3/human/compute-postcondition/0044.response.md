Output State: **`can_survive` is True, `bullets_used` is 0, `total_bullets_needed` is `health + bullets_used`, `t` is `t - 1`, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element in each tuple, `distance` is `abs(pos)`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The line `total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health` updates the value of `total_bullets_needed` to be the sum of `bullets_used` (which is 0 initially) and `health`. Since `bullets_used` is 0, `total_bullets_needed` becomes `health`. All other variables remain unchanged.
