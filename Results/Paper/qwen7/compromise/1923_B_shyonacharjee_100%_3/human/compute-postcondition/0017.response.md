Output State: **`bullets_used` is `health`, `total_bullets_needed` is `health`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples, the first element of the first tuple in `monsters` is `pos`, the second element of the first tuple in `monsters` is `health`, `can_survive` is `False`, and `distance` is `abs(pos)`**.

In this case, the code simply updates the value of the variable `distance` to be the absolute value of `pos`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
