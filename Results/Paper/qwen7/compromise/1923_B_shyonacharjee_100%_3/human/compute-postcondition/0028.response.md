Postcondition: **`can_survive` remains False, `bullets_used` is 2 * health, `total_bullets_needed` is 3 * health, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, monsters is a list of tuples that now contains at least two tuples, and the first tuple being processed is the second tuple in the list, `distance` is abs(pos) for the new first tuple, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
