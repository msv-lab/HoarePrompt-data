Output State: **`can_survive` remains False, `bullets_used` is `n * health`, `total_bullets_needed` is `n * health`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples with all tuples processed, `distance` is `abs(pos)` for the last processed tuple, `n` is updated to the first integer input, `k` is updated to the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
