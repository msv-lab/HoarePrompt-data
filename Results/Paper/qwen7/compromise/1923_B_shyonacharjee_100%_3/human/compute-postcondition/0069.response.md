Based on the initial state provided:

- `can_survive` remains `True`.
- `bullets_used` equals the sum of all `health` values in the `monsters` list.
- `total_bullets_needed` equals `bullets_used + health` of the last processed monster.
- `t` is `t - len(monsters)`.
- `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
- `monsters` is an empty list after all tuples have been processed.
- `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last processed monster.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
```

Given that `can_survive` is explicitly stated to remain `True`, the condition `if can_survive` will evaluate to `True`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
