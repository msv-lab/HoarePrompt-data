Postcondition: `can_survive` remains True, `total_bullets_needed` equals `health + bullets_used + health + next_health`, `t` is `t - 1`, `distance` is recalculated as `abs(next_pos)`, `pos` and `health` are updated to the next tuple in the `monsters` list, `bullets_used` is updated to `bullets_used + health + next_health, distance is calculated as abs(pos). If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, `can_survive` becomes False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.
