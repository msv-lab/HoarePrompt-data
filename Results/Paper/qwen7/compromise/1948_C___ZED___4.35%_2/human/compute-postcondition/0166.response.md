Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to the total number of test cases, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 for each test case, `b` remains the same as the input string for each test case, and `no_path` remains `False` unless the last second character of `b` is `'>';` in that case, `no_path` becomes `True`.**

In more detail:
- The variable `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases because the loop runs once for each test case.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, as specified in the problem statement.
- The string `b` remains unchanged for each test case as it is re-input at the start of each iteration but does not get modified within the loop.
- The variable `no_path` remains `False` unless the last second character of `b` is `'>';` in that case, `no_path` becomes `True`. This condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration, and if it is met, `no_path` is set to `True` and printed along with the index `k` (which is `n-1` in this case).
