Output State: **`k` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `a[k]` is not '>'; `no_path` is False.**

Explanation: The variable `no_path` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The values of `k`, `n`, and the current value of `a[k]` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged values along with the new assignment to `no_path`.
