Based on the initial state provided:

- `no_path` is `False`
- `k` is `5`
- `n` must be greater than `3`
- The current value of `a[5]` remains unchanged unless `a[5]` is not `'>'`, in which case `a[5]` will be updated accordingly.

The print statement `print(k)` will simply print the value of `k`.

Output: **5**
