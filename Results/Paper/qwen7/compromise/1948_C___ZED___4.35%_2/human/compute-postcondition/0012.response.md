Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `b` is the input string from the user, and the second last character of `b` is '>', and `no_path` is True.**

The variable `no_path` is set to `True`, which does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `b`, or the condition of the second last character of `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
