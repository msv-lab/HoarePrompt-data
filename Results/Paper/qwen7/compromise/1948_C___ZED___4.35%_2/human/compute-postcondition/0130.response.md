Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for k in range(0, n, 2)`. The variables involved here are `k` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is within the range defined by `range(0, n, 2)`. This means `k` should be less than `n` and should increase by 2 each time.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `k` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - If `b[2]` is not '>', then `no_path` is False.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `k`**: Since `k` starts from 0 and increases by 2 each time, the next value of `k` would be `2 + 2 = 4`.

5. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `k` (which will be 4) must still be less than `n`. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it must also be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to continue.

6. **Adjust the States**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `k` and `n`. 

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`k` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**.
