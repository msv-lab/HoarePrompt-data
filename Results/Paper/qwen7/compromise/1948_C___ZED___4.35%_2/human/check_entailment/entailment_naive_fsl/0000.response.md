Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to consider the movement of the robot through the grid properly. Let's analyze a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
4
4
<>><
><>>
```

According to the problem description, the robot starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, 4). Here is a step-by-step analysis of the robot's movement:

1. Start at (1, 1) and move right to (1, 2).
2. At (1, 2), the arrow points left, so the robot moves left to (1, 1).
3. From (1, 1), the robot moves right to (1, 2) again.
4. At (1, 2), the arrow points left, so the robot moves left to (1, 1).
5. This cycle continues indefinitely, and the robot never reaches (2, 4).

However, the program incorrectly prints 'YES' for this case because it only checks the last character of the second row and the value of `n`. It does not properly simulate the robot's movement through the grid.

To fix this, the program needs to simulate the robot's movement through the grid and check if it can reach (2, n) based on the given arrows.
