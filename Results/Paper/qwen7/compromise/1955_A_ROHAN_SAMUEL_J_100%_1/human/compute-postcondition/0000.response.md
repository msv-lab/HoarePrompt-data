Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input from `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**: The loop will execute as long as the input value (let's call this value `num_iterations`) is a positive integer. Since the initial state provides that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we know that `t` itself could be the input value or some derived value from `t`.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `num_iterations` must be a positive integer. Given the constraints, `t` is guaranteed to be a positive integer within the specified range. Therefore, `num_iterations` will always be valid and positive.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that the state before the loop starts includes the condition that the loop can execute. This means `t` should be adjusted to reflect that it can be used as the input to determine the number of iterations.

Given these considerations, the state before the loop starts should include the fact that `t` is a valid positive integer that can be used to determine the number of iterations.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

This ensures that the loop can execute as expected based on the given constraints.
