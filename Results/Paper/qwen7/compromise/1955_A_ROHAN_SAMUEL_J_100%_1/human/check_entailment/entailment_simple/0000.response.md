Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic to calculate the minimum cost is as follows:
   - If `n` is odd:
     - It checks if buying two yogurts at the promotional price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the regular price (`b`). If `2 * a < b`, it's more cost-effective to buy all yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`).
     - Otherwise, it calculates the cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price (`n // 2 * b`) and the remaining yogurt at the regular price (`a`).
   - If `n` is even:
     - It directly calculates the cost by buying all yogurts at the promotional price (`n // 2 * b`), since buying two yogurts at the promotional price is always cheaper than buying them at the regular price when `n` is even.
4. The program prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
