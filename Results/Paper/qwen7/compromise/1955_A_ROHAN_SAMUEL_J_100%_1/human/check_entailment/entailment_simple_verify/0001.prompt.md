You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each corresponding to the output of one test case. For each test case, if `n` is odd, it will print either `a * n` or `n // 2 * b + a`, depending on whether `2 * a < b` holds true. If `n` is even, it will print either `a * n` or `n // 2 * b`, again depending on whether `2 * a < b` holds true. The exact values printed will depend on the specific inputs provided for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculation Logic:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd (`n % 2`).
     - If `n` is odd, it further checks whether buying two yogurts at the promotional price is cheaper than buying each yogurt individually.
       - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
       - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and then buying the remaining yogurt individually).
   - If `n` is even, it directly checks whether buying two yogurts at the promotional price is cheaper than buying each yogurt individually.
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` (buying all pairs at the promotional price).

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The logic handles both odd and even values of `n` correctly.
   - It also correctly compares the costs between individual prices and promotional prices.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

### Verification with Example Input:

Let's verify the logic with the provided example input:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `2 5 9`
- Calculation:
  - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is even, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`
  - Therefore, use the promotional price: `2 // 2 * 9 = 9`
- Output: `9` (Correct)

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `3 5 9`
- Calculation:
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is odd, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`
  - Therefore, use the individual price: `3 * 5 = 15`
- Output: `15` (Incorrect, should be `14`)

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `3 5 11`
- Calculation:
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is odd, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`
  - Therefore, use the promotional price for two and individual price for one: `1 * 5 + 1 * 11 / 2 = 15`
- Output: `15` (Correct)

#### Test Case 4:
- Input: `4 5 11`
- Calculation:
  - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is even, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`
  - Therefore, use the promotional price: `4 // 2 * 11 = 22`
- Output: `22` (Incorrect, should be `20`)

### Conclusion:

The program does not handle the odd `n` case correctly when the promotional price for two is cheaper. It should calculate the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` instead of just `n // 2 * b`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
