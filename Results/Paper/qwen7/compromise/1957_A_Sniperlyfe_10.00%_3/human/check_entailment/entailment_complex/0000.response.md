Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly reads the input and calls the function `func_1` with the list of stick lengths.
- The function `func_1` correctly counts the frequency of each unique stick length using a dictionary.
- The function then calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4 (since each polygon requires 4 equal sides).
- The logic in the function is sound and matches the problem requirements.

Given the problem statement and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
