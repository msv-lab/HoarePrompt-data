Output State: **The program returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 4, where each frequency is the count of a unique stick length in the original list.**

This means that for each unique stick length in the original list (`arr`), the program calculates the integer division of its frequency (`v // 4`) and then sums these results to produce the final output.
