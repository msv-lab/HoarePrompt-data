Output State: **`score` is 0, `start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= start_pos <= n, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9, `p` is a list of integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of integers representing the array a; `current_pos` is set to `start_pos`.**

The code initializes `current_pos` to the value of `start_pos`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
