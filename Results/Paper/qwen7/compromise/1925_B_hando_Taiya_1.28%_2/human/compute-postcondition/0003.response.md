Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `ans` is the maximum value between any divisor `i` of `x` (where 1 ≤ i ≤ isqrt(x)) and its corresponding co-divisor `x // i` (where isqrt(x) < x // i ≤ x), such that both `i` and `x // i` are greater than or equal to `n`.
