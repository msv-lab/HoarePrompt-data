Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x**.

Explanation: The code `x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads two integers from the input, splits them by whitespace, and converts them to integers. These integers are then assigned to the variables `x` and `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, as it was not affected by the code. The conditions on the ranges of `t`, `x`, and `n` are preserved.
