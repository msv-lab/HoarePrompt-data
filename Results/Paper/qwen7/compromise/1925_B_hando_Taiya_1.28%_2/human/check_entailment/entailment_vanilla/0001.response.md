### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to split a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties is `x` and the GCD of these difficulties is maximized.
   - The program should handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of `x` and `n`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `x` is divisible by `n`, the optimal solution would be to have each sub-problem with difficulty `x // n`.
   - Otherwise, we need to find pairs `(i, x // i)` such that `i` divides `x` and `i <= n` or `x // i <= n`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`tc`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
   - It then iterates through possible values from `1` to `isqrt(x)` to check if `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - If `i` is a divisor of `x` and `n <= x // i`, it updates `ans` with the maximum value of `i`.
     - If `x // i` is a divisor of `x` and `n <= i`, it updates `ans` with the maximum value of `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum balance found.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `x` is divisible by `n` by checking both `i` and `x // i`.
   - The use of `isqrt(x)` ensures that the loop runs efficiently.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1()` is sound and covers all necessary conditions to maximize the balance.
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results as expected.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.
