Output State: **`sub_summ` is 0 + `val_a[0]`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the first element in `sec_arr`**

Explanation: The code `sub_summ += val_a[0]` adds the first element of `sec_arr` (which is stored in `val_a`) to `sub_summ`. Since `sub_summ` was initially 0, it now becomes 0 plus the first element of `sec_arr`. The list `sec_arr` and the variable `val_a` remain unchanged.
