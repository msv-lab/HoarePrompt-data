Output State: **`sub_summ' is the sum of all `val_a[0]` values in `sec_arr` plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, `main_ar` must contain at least one element (and will have one less element than before)**.

Explanation: The value of `sub_summ` is updated by adding `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
