Output State: **`sub_summ` is `val_a[0] + val_a[0]`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `val_a` is the second element in the original `sec_arr`**.

Explanation: The value of `sub_summ` was initially `0 + val_a[0]`. After executing `sub_summ += val_a[0]`, `sub_summ` is updated to `val_a[0] + val_a[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
