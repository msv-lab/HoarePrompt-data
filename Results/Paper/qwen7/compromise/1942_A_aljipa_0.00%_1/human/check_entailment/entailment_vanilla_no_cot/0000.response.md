Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly address the problem requirements. Here's why:

1. **Case for `k == n`:**
   - If `k == n`, every cyclic shift of the array should be sorted. This can only happen if all elements in the array are the same. However, the current implementation uses `[1] * n` which is correct for this specific case.

2. **Case for `k == 1`:**
   - If `k == 1`, only one cyclic shift should be sorted. The current implementation uses `range(n)` which generates a list of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. This will not ensure that only one cyclic shift is sorted. For example, with `n = 3` and `k = 1`, the array `[0, 1, 2]` would have three sorted cyclic shifts: `[0, 1, 2]`, `[1, 2, 0]`, and `[2, 0, 1]`.

3. **Case for other values of `k`:**
   - The current implementation uses `[-1]` for other values of `k`, which is incorrect because it doesn't provide a valid array for those cases.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to generate an array that meets the criteria for different values of `k`. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        if k == n:
            # All elements are the same
            res = [1] * n
        elif k == 1:
            # Only one cyclic shift is sorted
            res = [1] + list(range(2, n)) + [1]
        else:
            # No valid array exists for other values of k
            res = [-1]
        print(*res)
```

This corrected function handles the special cases where `k == n` and `k == 1` correctly and outputs `-1` for other values of `k`.
