Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `a` is the total number of iterations the loop ran, `i` ranges from `0` to `a-1`, `b` remains a positive integer, `j` is equal to `2 * b - 1`, and `k` is equal to `b`. The value of `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the values of `d` and `e` are determined by the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have taken on every integer value from `0` to `a-1`, where `a` is the number of times the outer loop was executed. For each iteration, `b` is a positive integer, `j` will always be `2 * b - 1`, and `k` will be set to `b`. The values of `t`, `d`, and `e` will reflect the inputs given during each iteration of the loop.
