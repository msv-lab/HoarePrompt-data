Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `j` is `b-1`, `k` is `b-1`, `k` is now equal to `j` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is explicitly mentioned, the `break` statement is likely breaking out of an implied loop or conditional structure. However, the values of the variables `b`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the conditions and values of `j` and `k` remain as they were initially, and we simply note that the execution breaks out of the loop or conditional block.
