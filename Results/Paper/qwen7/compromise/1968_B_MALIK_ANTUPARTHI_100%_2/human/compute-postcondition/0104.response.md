Postcondition: `b` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `b`. After executing the if-else block, either `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is updated to `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`, or both `j` and `k` are set to `j` (which is equal to `b`), depending on whether the condition `d[j] in e[k:]` is true or false, and whether `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`.
