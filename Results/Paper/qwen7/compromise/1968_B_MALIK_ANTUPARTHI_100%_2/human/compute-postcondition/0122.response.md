Output State: **`b` is a positive integer, `j` is `b + 1`, and `k` is `b + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `b`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, and we simply indicate that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
