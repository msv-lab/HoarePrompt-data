Output State: **`b` is an input integer, `j` is `b`, `k` is `b`, `i` is `b`, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input string**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `d`. Since no specific value is given for the input, `d` will hold the string representation of whatever is inputted. All other variables (`b`, `j`, `k`, `i`, `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
