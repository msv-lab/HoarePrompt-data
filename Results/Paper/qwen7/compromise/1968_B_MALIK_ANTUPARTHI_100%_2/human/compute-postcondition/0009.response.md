Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is the string input from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `k` is `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`, `j` is between 0 and `b-1` inclusive, and the character at index `j` in `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `k` to be the index of the character `d[j]` in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, plus 1, plus the original value of `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
