Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` in the range `range(a)`. This means the loop will iterate from `0` to `a-1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as:
   - `b` is greater than 0
   - `j` is `b`
   - `k` is `b`

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < a`. Since `i` starts at `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, the loop will stop when `i` reaches `a`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by `1` at the start of each new iteration.
   - The variables `j` and `k` remain unchanged within the loop body unless explicitly modified.

Given that no modifications to `j` and `k` are mentioned in the problem, they will still be equal to `b` at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `b` remains greater than 0.
   - `j` is `b`.
   - `k` is `b`.
   - `i` will be incremented by `1` from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Assuming `i` was `b-1` at the end of the previous iteration (since `j` and `k` were both `b`), the next value of `i` will be `b`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`b` is greater than 0, `j` is `b`, `k` is `b`, `i` is `b`**
