Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is a string input from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then `k` is updated to `j + 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
