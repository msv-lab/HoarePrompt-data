Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `b`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each value of `j` in the range from `0` to `b-1`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `b-1` and `b` is greater than 0.
   - For the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be `b`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be `b`.
   - `b` remains unchanged.

5. **Postconditions**:
   - The postcondition for the loop is that if `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated accordingly. However, since we are only concerned with the loop head variables `j` and `b`, we do not need to adjust `k`, `d`, `e`, or `c` here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`b` is greater than 0, `j` is `b`**.
