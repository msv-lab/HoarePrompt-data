Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is a string input from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `k` is `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`, `j` is `j + 1`**

Explanation: 
- The variable `k` is updated to the value of `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`. Here, `e[k:]` means the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end. `d[j]` refers to the character at index `j` in the string `d`. The method `index(d[j])` finds the position of the character `d[j]` in the substring `e[k:]`, and the result is adjusted by adding 1 and then adding `k`.
- The variable `j` is incremented by 1, i.e., `j` is now `j + 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`) remain unchanged as they are not directly involved in the operation.
