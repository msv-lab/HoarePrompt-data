Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is a string input from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `k` is either equal to `j + 1` or `j`, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `j + 1`. Otherwise, `k` is set to `j` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
