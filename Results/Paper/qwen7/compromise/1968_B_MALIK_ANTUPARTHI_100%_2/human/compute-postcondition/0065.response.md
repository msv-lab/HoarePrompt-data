Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `j` is `b-1`, `k` is `j + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or the innermost conditional block it is within. Given the initial conditions and the fact that no further operations are performed on the variables `b`, `j`, or `k` after the `break` statement, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the only effect of the `break` statement is to indicate that we exit the current loop or conditional block.
