You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = input()
        e = input()
        k = 0
        for j in range(b):
            if d[j] in e[k:]:
                k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
                if k == c or j == b - 1:
                    k = j + 1
                    break
            else:
                k = j
                break
        print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `m`, and binary strings `a` and `b`. It calculates and prints the position `k` in string `e` where the substring `d` (derived from `a`) can be found, or indicates if it cannot be found. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to find the maximum prefix length `k` such that the first `k` characters of string `a` form a subsequence of string `b`. However, the logic within the loop is flawed.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The program uses a nested loop to check if each character of `d` (string `a`) is present in the remaining part of `e` (string `b`). This approach is incorrect because it does not properly handle the requirement of finding the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

2. **Incorrect Subsequence Check**: The program checks if `d[j]` is in `e[k:]` and updates `k` accordingly. However, this does not guarantee that the characters are in the correct order to form a subsequence. For example, consider the following test case:

   ```
   Input:
   1
   5 4
   10011
   1110

   Expected Output:
   2
   ```

   The program should output `2` because the prefix "10" of string `a` is a subsequence of string `b`. However, the current implementation might fail to correctly identify this.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program fails to handle edge cases properly. For instance, if `a` is a prefix of `b`, the program should return the length of `a`. However, the current implementation might not handle this correctly due to the flawed logic.

To fix the program, a more appropriate approach would involve using a two-pointer technique to traverse both strings and ensure the characters match in the correct order. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = input()
        e = input()
        k = 0
        for j in range(b):
            found = False
            for l in range(k, c):
                if d[j] == e[l]:
                    k = l + 1
                    found = True
                    break
            if not found:
                break
        print(k)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the characters of `a` are checked in the correct order against `b` to form a subsequence.
