Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cnt` is a list of length `n+1` filled with zeros, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for every element `x` in `cnt`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt` as a list of length `n+1` filled with zeros. This changes the value of `cnt` but does not affect the values of `n`, `ans`, or `a`. Therefore, `n` remains an input integer, `cnt` is now a list of length `n+1` filled with zeros, `ans` remains the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for every element `x` in `cnt`, and `a` remains a list of integers obtained from input.
