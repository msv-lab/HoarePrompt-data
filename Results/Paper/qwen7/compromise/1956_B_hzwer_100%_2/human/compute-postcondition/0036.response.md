Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variables `x` and `cnt`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `cnt`. For the loop to execute, `cnt` must contain at least one element.

3. **Adjust the states**: 
   - The variable `ans` is not directly involved in the loop condition and its value does not affect whether the loop will execute or not. Therefore, it does not need to be adjusted.
   - The variable `cnt` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. 

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are related to `cnt`.

**State:**
- `cnt` must contain at least one element.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`cnt` must contain at least one element**
