Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cnt` is a list of length `n`, and `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for every element `x` in `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, but it does not affect the values of `cnt` or `ans`. Therefore, `cnt` remains a list of length `n`, and `ans` remains the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for every element `x` in `cnt`.
