Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `x` which is iterating over the list `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body Behavior**: The loop body increments `cnt[x]` by 1. This means that each element `x` in the list `a` is being processed and its count in `cnt` is being incremented.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1 for each `x` in `a`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `x` is an element of `a`, and `a` is a non-empty list, the loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `a`.
   - After processing one element `x` from `a`, the next element in `a` will be the focus of the next iteration.
   - The `cnt` dictionary will have the count of the current `x` incremented by 1.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `a` will now contain all elements except the one that was just processed.
   - `cnt[x]` will be incremented by 1 for the current `x`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers (excluding the last processed element), `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1 for the last processed element `x`**.
