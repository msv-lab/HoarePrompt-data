Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer \( n \) and a list of integers \( a \). It counts the occurrences of each integer in the list \( a \) and calculates the total number of reductions needed such that each integer appears at most once. The function prints the total count of these reductions for each test case.**
