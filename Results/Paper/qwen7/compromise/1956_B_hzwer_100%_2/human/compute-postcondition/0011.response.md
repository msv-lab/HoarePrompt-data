Output State: The variable `a` is an empty list, and `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element represents the count of its index value in the original list `a`. All elements in `cnt` are incremented based on the occurrence of their respective indices in `a` during the loop's iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cnt` will contain the frequency count of each integer present in the original list `a`.
