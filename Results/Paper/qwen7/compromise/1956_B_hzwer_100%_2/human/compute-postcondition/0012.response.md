Output State: The list `a` is empty, and the list `cnt` is of length `n + 1` with each element representing the count of occurrences of each integer from the original list `a`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, every integer from the list `a` will have been processed exactly once. Therefore, the list `a` becomes empty since all elements have been accounted for in the `cnt` list. The `cnt` list, which was initialized with all zeros, now contains the count of how many times each integer from the original list `a` appeared. The length of `cnt` remains `n + 1`, where `n` is the number of unique integers in the original list `a`.
