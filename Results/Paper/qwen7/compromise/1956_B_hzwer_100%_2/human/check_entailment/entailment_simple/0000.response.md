Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally against an opponent who always plays optimally to maximize their score while minimizing yours.
2. The provided solution reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and calculates the maximum number of points you can get.
3. The logic in the solution is as follows:
   - It reads the number of cards `n`.
   - It reads the integers on the cards in your hand.
   - It counts the occurrences of each integer using `cnt`.
   - It calculates the maximum points you can get by ensuring that for each integer `x` in `cnt`, you can get at most `max(0, x - 1)` points because Nene will always try to prevent you from scoring if possible.
4. The solution correctly handles the constraints and the logic for calculating the maximum points you can get.
5. Given the problem statement and the example, the provided solution matches the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
