Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by optimally selecting cards, given that Nene always plays optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours.
2. The provided code reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it:
   - Reads the number of cards \( n \).
   - Reads the integers on the cards in your hand.
   - Counts the occurrences of each integer using `cnt`.
   - Calculates the answer by summing up `max(0, x - 1)` for each count `x` in `cnt`.

3. The logic behind the calculation:
   - For each integer \( x \), if it appears more than once in your hand, you can ensure that one of those cards will be played on the first occurrence, and Nene will play the other, thus scoring 1 point for Nene. Therefore, for each integer \( x \) that appears more than once, you can ensure at least one point for yourself by playing one of those cards first.
   - The expression `max(0, x - 1)` correctly accounts for this: if \( x > 1 \), you can ensure at least one point; otherwise, if \( x \leq 1 \), you cannot ensure any points.

4. The code correctly implements this logic by counting the occurrences and then calculating the result based on the counts.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the provided solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
