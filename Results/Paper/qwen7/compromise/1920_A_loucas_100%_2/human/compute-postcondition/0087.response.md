Output State: **`num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `big` is a list containing the integer `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Since `a` is an input integer, it is added to the list `big` as its first element. All other variables remain unchanged.
