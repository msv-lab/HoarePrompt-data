Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `i` is the next element in `no`.
  - `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less`.
  - `i` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`.

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for i in no:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head specifies that `i` should take values from the iterable `no`.

2. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be the next element in `no`.
   - Additionally, the conditions involving `less` and `big` must still hold true for the new value of `i`.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is derived from the iterable `no`, the next value of `i` will be the next element in `no`.
   - The conditions involving `less` and `big` must still be satisfied by this new value of `i`.

### New State:
- **`i` is the next element in `no`:** This means `i` will change to the next value in the sequence defined by `no`.
- **`i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less`:** This condition must still hold true for the new value of `i`.
- **`i` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`:** This condition must still hold true for the new value of `i`.

### Final State:
- **State:**
  - `i` is the next element in `no`.
  - `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less`.
  - `i` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`.

So, the final state is:
**`i` is the next element in `no`, `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less`, and `i` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`.**
