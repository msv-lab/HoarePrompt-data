Output State: **`innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an input integer different from 2, `a` is an input integer, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.**

The code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Since `a` is an input integer, the list `no` now contains this value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
