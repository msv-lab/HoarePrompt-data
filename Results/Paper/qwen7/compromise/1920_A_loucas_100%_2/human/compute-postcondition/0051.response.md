Output State: **`i` is the first element of `no` and is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`; `num` is `no[0] - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is decremented by 1. Since `i` is the first element of `no`, `num` was initially set to `no[0]`. After decrementing `num` by 1, `num` becomes `no[0] - 1`. All other conditions and relationships remain unchanged.
