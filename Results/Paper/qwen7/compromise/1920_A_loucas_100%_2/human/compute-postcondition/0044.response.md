Postcondition: **`innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`, `big` contains all the integers `a` for which `x` was 1 during the iterations, `less` contains all the integers `a` for which `x` was 2 during the iterations, `no` contains all the integers `a` for which `x` was neither 1 nor 2 during the iterations, `num` is equal to `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, and the current value of `num` is less than 1.**
