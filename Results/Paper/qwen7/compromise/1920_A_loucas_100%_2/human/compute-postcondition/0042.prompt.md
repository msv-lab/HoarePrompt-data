Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `innerLoop` is an input integer, `loop` must be an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive; `iterable` is 0; `less` is an empty list; `big` is an empty list; `no` is an empty list; `num` is 0
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0. If `x` is 1, `a` is added to the list `big`. If `x` is 2, `a` is appended to the list `less`. Otherwise, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `innerLoop` must be greater than 0; `iterable2` is 1; `x` is an input integer; `a` is an input integer; `big` contains the value of `a`; either `less` is a list containing `a` or `no` is a list containing `a`, depending on whether `x` equals 1 or 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `innerLoop` must be greater than 0; `iterable2` is 2; `x` is the first integer inputted by the user; `a` is the second integer inputted by the user; `big` contains the value of `a`; either `less` is a list containing `a` or `no` is a list containing `a`, depending on the value of `x`. If `x` equals 1, `big` now contains the value `[a, a]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
