Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in no:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `no`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: The postcondition given is that `i` is an integer such that `i <= min_less` and `i + 1 < max_big`. This means that `i` should be within a specific range defined by `min_less` and `max_big`.

3. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next value in the sequence defined by `no`. Since `i` is an integer, it will increment by 1 from its current value.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `no` remains unchanged as it is the iterable being used in the loop.

Given the postcondition, if `i` is currently such that `i <= min_less` and `i + 1 < max_big`, then for the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- We need to ensure that `i + 1` still satisfies the condition `i + 1 < max_big`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `no` remains unchanged.

Since the exact values of `min_less` and `max_big` are not provided, we can express the state in terms of these conditions.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 1 <= min_less` and `i + 2 < max_big`, `no` remains unchanged**.
