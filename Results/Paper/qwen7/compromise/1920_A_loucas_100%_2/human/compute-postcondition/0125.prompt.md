Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is equal to or greater than 3, `iterable2` is 2, `big` is a list that may contain integers based on user inputs where `x == 1`, `less` is a list that may contain integers based on user inputs where `x == 2` and `a` is not already in `less`, `no` is a list that contains integers based on user inputs where `x` is neither 1 nor 2, and `num` remains unchanged as it is always 0 since the condition `num < 1` is never met.
Code of the loop:
for i in no:
    if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
        num -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `no` contains at least one integer. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list, then the current minimum value in the `less` list is greater than or equal to `i`, and the current maximum value in the `big` list is less than or equal to `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `no` contains at least one integer, `i` is the next integer in the `no` list, and either `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list, or `i` remains unchanged from its original value in the `no` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `no` contains at least one integer, `i` is the next integer in the `no` list, and either `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list, or `i` remains unchanged from its original value in the `no` list; additionally, `num` is decremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
