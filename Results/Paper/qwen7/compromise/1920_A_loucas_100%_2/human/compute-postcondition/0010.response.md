Output State: **`innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `big` is a list containing the value `a`.**

Explanation: The code `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Since `a` is an input integer, `big` now contains this integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
