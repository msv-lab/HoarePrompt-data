Output State: **`i` is an integer such that it is less than or equal to the minimum value in the list `less` and one less than the maximum value in the list `big`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is decremented by 1. Since `i` was originally less than or equal to the minimum value in the list `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list `big`, after decrementing `i` by 1, `i` will still be less than or equal to the minimum value in the list `less` (because `i` was already the smallest possible value), but it will now be one less than the maximum value in the list `big` (since it was previously equal to the maximum value).
