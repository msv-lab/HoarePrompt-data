Postcondition: `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `a` is contained in either a list named `big`, `less`, or `no`, depending on the value of `x`. If `x` equals 1, `a` is in the list `big`; if `x` equals 2, `a` is in the list `less`; otherwise, `a` is in the list `no`.
