Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is the first element of `no` and is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`.
   - In the if part, `num` is set to `no[0] - 1`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `no` with the variable `i`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `no`, the next value of `i` will be the next element in `no`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must still be within the bounds defined by `less` and `big`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is the first element of `no`.
- `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less`.
- `i` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`.

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be the next element in `no`.
- The new `i` must still satisfy the conditions relative to `less` and `big`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is the next element in `no`.
- `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less`.
- `i` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`.

Since `i` is the first element in `no` in the previous iteration, the next element in `no` will be `i + 1` (assuming `no` is a list of integers).

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is the next element in `no`, `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less`, `i` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`**.
