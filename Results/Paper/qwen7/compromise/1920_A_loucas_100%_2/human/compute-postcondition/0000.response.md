Output State: **`loop` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `loop` ≤ 500.**

Explanation: The code `loop = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `loop`. The initial conditions for `t` and the constraints for `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, with the constraints described. The only change is that `loop` now holds the value of the integer input provided by the user, which is within the specified range for `loop`.
