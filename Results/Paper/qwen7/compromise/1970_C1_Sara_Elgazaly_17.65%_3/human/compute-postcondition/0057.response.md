Output State: **`s` remains False, `x` is equal to `y`, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `y` is the popped element from `lst[x]`, and `lst[x]` now has one less element; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the loop or if statement that `x` was set to equal `y` is broken, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
