Output State: **`s` remains False, `x` is equal to `y`, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `y` is the popped element from `lst[x]`, and `lst[x]` now has one less element.**

Explanation: The code `y = lst[x].pop()` pops the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to `y`. The other variables (`s`, `x`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged. The list `lst[x]` now has one less element because the last element was popped.
