Output State: **`s` is False, `x` is equal to `y`, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `y` is the popped element from `lst[x]`, and `lst[x]` is now an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `y = lst[x].pop()` pops the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to `y`. After popping, `lst[x]` becomes an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged.
