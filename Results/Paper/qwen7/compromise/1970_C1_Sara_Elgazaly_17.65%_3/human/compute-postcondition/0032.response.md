Output State: **`s` is True, `x` is equal to `y`, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `y` is the popped element from `lst[x]`, and `lst[x]` is now a non-empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `y = lst[x].pop()` pops the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to `y`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `y` now holds the popped element from `lst[x]`, which was a non-empty list before the operation.
