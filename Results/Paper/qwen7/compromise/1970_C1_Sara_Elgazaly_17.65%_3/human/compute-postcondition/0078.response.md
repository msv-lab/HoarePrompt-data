Output State: **`s` is True, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` which was popped from the list, and `lst[y]` is now empty.**

This means that the value of `y` is now set to the last element of the list `lst[x]` after it has been popped from the list, and `lst[y]` is now an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged.
