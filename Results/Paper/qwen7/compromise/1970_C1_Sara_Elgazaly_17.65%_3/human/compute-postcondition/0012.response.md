Output State: **`x` must be at least 3, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `lst[a]` now contains the value `[a, b, b]`**

Explanation: The code `lst[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list at index `a` in the list `lst`. Since `lst[b]` initially contains `[a, b]`, appending `b` to `lst[a]` results in `lst[a]` becoming `[a, b, b]`. The values of `x`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
