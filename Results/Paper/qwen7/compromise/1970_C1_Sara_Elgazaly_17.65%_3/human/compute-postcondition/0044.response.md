Output State: **`s` is False, `x` is equal to `y`, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `y` is the popped element from `lst[x]`, and `lst[x]` is now an empty list; `x` is now equal to `y`.**

Explanation: The code `x = y` assigns the value of `y` to `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
