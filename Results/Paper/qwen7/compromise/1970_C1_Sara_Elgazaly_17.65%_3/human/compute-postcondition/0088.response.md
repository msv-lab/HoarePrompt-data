Output State: **`s` is False, `x` is equal to `y`, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, and `lst[x]` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The initial state of `s` is True. The line `s = not s` changes the value of `s` from True to False. The values of `x`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. `lst[x]` remains an empty list as no operation was performed on it in this line. Therefore, the updated state of `s` is False, while `x`, `a`, and `b` retain their initial values.
