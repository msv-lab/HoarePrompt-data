Output State: **`s` is True, `x` is the final value it was set to, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` after popping it.**

Explanation: The code `y = lst[x].pop()` pops the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to the variable `y`. The values of `s`, `x`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation.
