Output State: **`x` must be at least 1, `a` is the first integer entered by the user, `b` is the second integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into integers, assigning them to variables `a` and `b`. The precondition that `x` must be at least 1 remains unchanged.
