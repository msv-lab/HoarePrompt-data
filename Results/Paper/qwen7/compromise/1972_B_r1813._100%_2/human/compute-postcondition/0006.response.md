Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, the function processes the string `s` and returns the final position after moving up (`U`) or down (`D`) `n` times, starting from position 0, and repeats this for `t` test cases.**

Note: The actual implementation details, such as how the function processes the test cases and returns the results, are not described here as per the given instruction.
