Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input.
2. For each test case, it extracts the number of coins (`n`) and the string `s` representing the orientation of the coins.
3. It then counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`.
4. Based on whether this count is odd or even, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' respectively.
5. The logic implemented matches the problem statement: if the count of 'U' is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, she loses.
6. The program handles multiple test cases as specified and processes each one correctly according to the rules of the game.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
