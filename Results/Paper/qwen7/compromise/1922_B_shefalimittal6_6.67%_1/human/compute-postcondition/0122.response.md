Output State: **All keys in `num_of_lens` have been processed, and `res` contains the sum of all combinatorial calculations performed during the loop iterations.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, all keys in the `num_of_lens` dictionary will have been processed. The variable `res` will contain the cumulative result of all the combinatorial calculations performed within the loop. Specifically, for each value `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 3, `math.comb(cnt, 3)` is added to `res`. Additionally, for each `cnt` that is greater than or equal to 2, `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` (where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`) is added to `res`. The `num_of_lens` dictionary will be empty after all keys have been processed, as it is emptied of its contents with each iteration through the loop.
