Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the iteration variable `x` which is taken from the list `nums`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `x`, `nums`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `x`**: Since `x` is taken from `nums` during each iteration, the initial value of `x` is irrelevant as it changes with each iteration.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `nums`**: The list `nums` is already defined as a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string. The condition given is that `nums` is a list of integers.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `nums` must contain at least one element. If `nums` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `nums` is not empty for the loop to execute.

**State after adjustment**:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, and it must have at least one element.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, and `nums` must have at least one element**.
