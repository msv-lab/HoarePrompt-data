Based on the initial state provided:

- `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.
- `cnt` is the last integer value from the original `num_of_lens.values()`. Since `num_of_lens` is empty, there are no values in it, so `cnt` is `None`.
- `res` is the sum of applying the given combinatorial operations over all integers in the original `num_of_lens.values()` that met the conditions. Since `num_of_lens` is empty, there are no integers to apply any combinatorial operations to, so `res` is `0`.

Therefore, the `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`, which is `0`.

Output: **0**
