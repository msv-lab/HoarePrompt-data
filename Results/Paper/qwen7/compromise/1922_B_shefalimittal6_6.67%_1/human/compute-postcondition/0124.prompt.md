Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. All other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    num_of_lens = {}
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for x in nums:
        num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
    res = 0
    for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
        if cnt >= 3:
            res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
        if cnt >= 2:
            total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
            res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `num_of_lens` remains a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `nums` and its value is the total count of occurrences of that element in `nums`. The variable `res` is updated to include the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for every `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 3, and the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for every `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 2, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`. The value of `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt` for each iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The `num_of_lens` dictionary is empty, `cnt` is the last integer value from the original `num_of_lens.values()`, and `res` is the sum of applying the given combinatorial operations over all integers in the original `num_of_lens.values()` that met the conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All keys in `num_of_lens` have been processed, and `res` contains the sum of all combinatorial calculations performed during the loop iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
