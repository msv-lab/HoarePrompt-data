Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary with one less key-value pair, `cnt` is the next integer in `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. The value of `cnt` remains the next integer in `num_of_lens.values()`, and `total_sum` remains the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. The dictionary `num_of_lens` and its structure (one less key-value pair) remain unchanged.
