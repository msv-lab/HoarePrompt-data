Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( t \) indicating the number of subsequent test cases, followed by a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers. For each test case, it calculates a result based on the frequency of each integer in the list. Specifically, it counts the number of ways to choose 3 or more identical integers and pairs of identical integers, and sums these combinations to produce the final result for each test case. This process is repeated for each test case, and the results for all test cases are printed.**
