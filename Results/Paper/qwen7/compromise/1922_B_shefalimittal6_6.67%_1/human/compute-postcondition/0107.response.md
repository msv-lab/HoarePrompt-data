Output State: **`num_of_lens` must not be empty, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, `next_cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.**

Explanation: The code `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` increments the value of `res` by the result of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. The conditions related to `next_cnt` and the operations involving `math.comb(next_cnt, 2) * total_sum` are not affected by this line of code, so `next_cnt` remains the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` and `res` is updated accordingly.
