Output State: The `num_of_lens` dictionary will contain the count of each unique integer from the `nums` list. Specifically, for every integer `x` in `nums`, `num_of_lens[x]` will be set to the number of times `x` appears in `nums`. All other variables (`cnt`, `res`, `t`, `n`) will retain their values from the final iteration of the loop, and `nums` will be an empty list since all elements have been processed.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, the `num_of_lens` dictionary will show how many times each number appeared in the original `nums` list. The other variables will keep their values from the last iteration, and the `nums` list will be empty because all its elements have been counted.
