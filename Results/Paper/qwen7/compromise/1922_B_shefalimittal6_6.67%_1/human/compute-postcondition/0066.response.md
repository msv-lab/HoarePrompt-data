Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary with one less key-value pair, `cnt` is the next integer greater than or equal to 2, and `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`**.

Explanation: The code `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` increments `res` by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Since `cnt` is the next integer greater than or equal to 2, `math.comb(cnt, 3)` is a specific value. The dictionary `num_of_lens` and the variable `total_sum` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the value of `cnt` remains the same. Therefore, `res` is updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to its previous value.
