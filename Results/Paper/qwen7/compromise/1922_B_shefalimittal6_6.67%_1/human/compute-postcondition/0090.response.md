Output State: **`nums` must have at least one element, `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1 and equals num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1.**

This means that the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is updated to be its current value (which is incremented by 1) or 1 if it was not previously defined. The precondition that `nums` must have at least one element remains unchanged.
