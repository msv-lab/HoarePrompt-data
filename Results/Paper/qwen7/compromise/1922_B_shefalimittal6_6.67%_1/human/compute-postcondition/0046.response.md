Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `x`, which is assigned the value from the `nums` list in each iteration.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: 
   - `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.
   - `res` is initially updated based on the values in `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute for each element `x` in `nums`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `nums`, the initial state of `nums` is important. We need to ensure that `nums` is a non-empty list because if it is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - The variable `x` will take the value of each element in `nums` during each iteration, but its initial value before the loop starts is not specified in the loop head.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the one related to `nums` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
- `nums` must be a non-empty list.

So, the final answer is:
**State: **`nums` must be a non-empty list**.
