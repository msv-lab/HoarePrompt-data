Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the components:

1. `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `nums` and its value is the total count of occurrences of that element in `nums`.
2. `res` is updated based on the counts in `num_of_lens.values()`:
   - For each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 3, `res` includes the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
   - For each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 2, `res` includes the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`.

Given this, the value of `res` will be a sum of combinatorial calculations based on the counts of each unique element in `nums`.

To express this in the required format:

Output: **res (where res is the sum of math.comb(cnt, 3) for each cnt in num_of_lens.values() if cnt >= 3, plus the sum of math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum for each cnt in num_of_lens.values() if cnt >= 2, where total_sum is the sum of all values in num_of_lens.values() except the current cnt)**
