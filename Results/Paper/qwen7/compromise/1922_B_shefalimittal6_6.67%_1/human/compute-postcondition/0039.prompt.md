Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `num_of_lens` will be a dictionary where each key is an element from `nums` and its value is the total count of occurrences of that element in `nums`. The variable `n` remains an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, and `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `res` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary, `cnt` is a value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus the combination of `cnt` taken 2 at a time multiplied by `total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `res` remains unchanged; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt >= 2`, or `math.comb(cnt, 3) * total_sum` if `cnt < 2`, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3) * total_sum` plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `num_of_lens` remains a non-empty dictionary, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`, and `res` is updated to include `math.comb(cnt, 3) * total_sum` plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. The value of `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
