Output State: **`num_of_lens` must not be empty, `res` remains unchanged, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except for `cnt`. The value of `res` is not affected by this operation, so it remains unchanged. The variable `total_sum` is updated to hold this new sum. The precondition that `num_of_lens` must not be empty is still valid.
