Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, and `value` will be an input integer that has never been used within the loop during its execution. The variable `sum_value_digits` will hold the sum of the digits of `200000 - 1`, which is 18 (since 1 + 9 + 8 + 9 + ... + 1 + 9 + 8 + 9 = 18), and `values[200001]` will be the cumulative sum of `sum_value_digits` for all integers from 1 to 200000, which is 18 * 200000 / 2 = 1,800,000.
