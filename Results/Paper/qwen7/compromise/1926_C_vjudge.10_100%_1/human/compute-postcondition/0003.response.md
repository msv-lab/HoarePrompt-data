Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `inf`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue executing**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `inf`.

4. **Check the given state**: We know that `t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `inf` is 200001, and `values` is a list of 200001 zeros.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 1.
   - The constant `inf` is 200001.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `inf`.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. Specifically, `i` should be set to 1, and `inf` should be set to 200001.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 1**.
