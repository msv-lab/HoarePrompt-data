Output State: **`i` is a positive integer and its string representation is non-empty; `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of the current digit `x`.**

Explanation: The code `sum_value_digits += int(x)` updates the value of `sum_value_digits` by adding the integer value of `x`. The precondition that `i` must be a positive integer and its string representation must be non-empty remains unchanged. The variable `x` is converted to an integer using `int(x)`, and this integer value is added to `sum_value_digits`.
