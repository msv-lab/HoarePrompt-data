Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be 200001, `sum_value_digits` will be the sum of the digits of `i-1`, and `values[200001]` will be the cumulative sum of `sum_value_digits` for all integers from 1 to 200000.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will reach 200001 (since the loop runs from 1 to 200001). The variable `sum_value_digits` will hold the sum of the digits of the last value of `i` (which is 200000), and `values[200001]` will contain the total sum of `sum_value_digits` for every integer from 1 to 200000.
