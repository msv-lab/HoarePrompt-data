Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is explicitly given as 199,999.
- `value` is an input integer, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(values[value])
```

Here, `values` is not defined in the initial state, and since it is not provided, we cannot determine its contents. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value that will be printed from `values[value]`.

However, we can describe the output in terms of the given information:

Output: **values[value] (where value is an input integer)**
