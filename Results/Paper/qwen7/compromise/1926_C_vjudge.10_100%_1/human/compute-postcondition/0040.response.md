Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is set to 200001.
- `value` is an input integer.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(values[value])
```

Here, `values` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since it is not defined, we cannot determine its contents or the value of `values[value]`. Therefore, we can only describe the general form of the output.

Output: **values[value]** (where `value` is an input integer and `values` is an undefined list)
