Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is set to 200000.
- `value` is an input integer.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(values[value])
```

Here, `values` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `values` is not defined and no default value is provided, it's impossible to determine the exact content of `values`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value that will be printed from `values[value]`.

However, we can describe the situation as follows:

Output: **values[value] (where `value` is an input integer and `values` is an undefined list)**
