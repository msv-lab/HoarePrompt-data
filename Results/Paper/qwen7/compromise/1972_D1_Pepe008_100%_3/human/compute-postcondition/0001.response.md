State: **`T` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, t is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `t` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.
2. The loop iterates over the range of `T`, meaning `t` will take values from 0 to `T-1`.
3. For the loop to execute, `T` must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4).
4. No other variables or states need to be adjusted since they are not mentioned in the loop head.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `T` to ensure it is within the valid range and `t` to its initial value of 0.
