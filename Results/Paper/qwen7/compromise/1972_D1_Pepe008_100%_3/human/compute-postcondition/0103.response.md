To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the loop logic step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is `T`.
   - `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
   - `a` is the first element of `info`, which is an integer.
   - `b` is the final value it was set to during the loop's execution.
   - `suma` is the sum calculated based on the loop's conditions.
   - `i` is `b + 1`.
   - `x` is `a - (b * (b - 1)) // b ** 2 + 1`.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b + 1`.
   - For each iteration, `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
   - `suma` is incremented by `x + 1` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0`.
   - Additionally, `suma` is incremented by `1` if both `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are true.

3. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop completes, `t` remains `T`.
   - `info` stays as the list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
   - `b` is the upper limit of the range specified in the loop.
   - `i` is `b + 1`.
   - `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` for the last iteration, but since `i` is `b + 1`, `x` will be `a - ((b + 1) * b) // (b + 1) ** 2 + 1`.

Given the above, let's simplify the expression for `x` in the last iteration:

- For `i = b + 1`, `x` is calculated as:
  \[
  x = a - \frac{(b + 1) \cdot b}{(b + 1)^2} + 1 = a - \frac{b(b + 1)}{(b + 1)(b + 1)} + 1 = a - \frac{b}{b + 1} + 1
  \]

- Simplifying further:
  \[
  x = a - \frac{b}{b + 1} + 1 = a - \left(1 - \frac{1}{b + 1}\right) + 1 = a - 1 + \frac{1}{b + 1} + 1 = a + \frac{1}{b + 1}
  \]

Since `x` is a floating-point number, it will be rounded to the nearest integer due to integer division. Therefore, `x` will be approximately `a` (since `1 / (b + 1)` is very small).

4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - `suma` is incremented by `x + 1` if the conditions are met.
   - Since `x` is close to `a`, the increment will be `a + 1` if the conditions are met.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The print statement outputs `suma - 2`.
   - Given the loop logic and the conditions, `suma` will be the sum of all `x + 1` values, which simplifies to `a + 1` for each valid `i`.

Therefore, the final output will be:

Output: **suma - 2 (where suma is the sum of `x + 1` for each valid `i`, which is close to `a + 1` for each iteration)**

Given the conditions and the loop logic, the precise value of `suma` will be `a + 1` for each valid `i`, so:

Output: **a**
