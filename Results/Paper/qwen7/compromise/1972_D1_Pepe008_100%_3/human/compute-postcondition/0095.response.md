Output State: **`t` is `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `info` is an integer `a`, `b` must be at least 4, `suma` is `x + 2`, `i` is `4`, `x` is `a - 4 // 4`, `suma` is `x + 2**.

Explanation: The code `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to `suma`. Given that `x` is calculated as `a - 4 // 4`, `suma` is updated to `x + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
