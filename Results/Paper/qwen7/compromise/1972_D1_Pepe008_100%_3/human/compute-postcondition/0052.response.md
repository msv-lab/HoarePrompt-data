Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `b` must be a positive integer
   - `x` is 1
   - If \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) is greater than 0, then `suma` is 2. Otherwise, the value of `suma` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, b + 1):
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` ranges from 1 to `b`.
   - The loop variable `b` is used as the upper limit for the range.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than or equal to `b`.

5. **Conditions to Satisfy for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` must be 2.
   - `b` must still be a positive integer.
   - `x` remains unchanged at 1.
   - The value of `suma` remains unchanged based on the condition \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` must be 2.
   - `b` must be a positive integer.
   - `x` must be 1.
   - `suma` remains unchanged based on the condition \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `b` must be a positive integer, `x` is 1, `suma` remains unchanged based on the condition \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\)**.
