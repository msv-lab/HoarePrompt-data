Output State: **`T` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.**

The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` (which is equivalent to `T`) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the same condition applies to `T` after the code is executed. The other conditions about `n` and `m` remain unchanged because they have not been involved in the given code snippet.
