Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `b + 1` used in the `range` function.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is the loop variable, which starts from 1 (inclusive) and goes up to `b + 1` (exclusive).
   - `b` is the second element of the list `info`, converted to an integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `b + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be 1 initially.
   - `b` must be a positive integer because if `b` is 0 or negative, the range `1, b + 1` would not include any values, and the loop would not execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `b`.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `i` should be 1.
- `b` must be a positive integer.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `b` must be a positive integer**.
