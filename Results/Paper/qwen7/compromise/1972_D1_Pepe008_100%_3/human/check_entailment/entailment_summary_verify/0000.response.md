### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided program is incorrect:

1. **Formula and Conditions in the Program**:
   - The program uses the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` to calculate `x`. This formula does not directly relate to the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The conditions `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are not relevant to the problem at hand. These conditions do not check whether `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The program attempts to count pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the logic implemented does not correctly check this condition.
   - For example, in the test case `(n=10, m=8)`, the program incorrectly counts some pairs as valid, such as `(6, 2)`, which does not satisfy the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, one should iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The program should use the `math.gcd` function to compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) and then check the condition for each pair.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
