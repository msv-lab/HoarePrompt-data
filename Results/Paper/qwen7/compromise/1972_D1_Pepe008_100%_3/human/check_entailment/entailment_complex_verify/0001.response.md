### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the key points and verify them step-by-step:

1. **Formula for \(x\)**:
   - The formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i(i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\) does not correctly represent the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). This formula seems to be an attempt to count something related to the multiples but does not directly address the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **GCD Consideration**:
   - The program does not explicitly calculate or use the greatest common divisor (\(\gcd(a, b)\)) in the calculation, which is crucial for determining the valid pairs. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) requires considering the GCD.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition check \((a - i(i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i(i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) is not relevant to the problem. These conditions do not help in finding the valid pairs.

Given these issues, the original assessment correctly concludes that the program is incorrect. However, let's verify the annotated code to ensure there are no other subtle errors or misunderstandings.

### Annotated Code Verification:

- **Initialization**: 
  - `T` is correctly initialized as the number of test cases.
  - The loop iterates over each test case.
  - `info` is split into `a` and `b`.

- **Loop Logic**:
  - The loop iterates from 1 to `b`.
  - `x` is calculated using the formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i(i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\).
  - If `x` is greater than 0, it is added to `suma`.
  - Additional 1 is added to `suma` if both \((a - i(i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i(i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) are true.

- **Final Output**:
  - The result is printed after subtracting 2 from `suma`.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Formula for \(x\)**:
   - The formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i(i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\) is not derived from the problem statement and does not correctly count the number of valid pairs.

2. **GCD Consideration**:
   - The program does not compute \(\gcd(a, b)\) and use it in the condition check.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition \((a - i(i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i(i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) is irrelevant and does not contribute to solving the problem.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
