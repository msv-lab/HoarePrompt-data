Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Let's break down the issue:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `a - i * (i - 1)` is used in the calculation, but it should be checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. This is not correctly implemented in the given code.

2. **GCD Calculation Missing**: The program does not calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, which is necessary for determining if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Summation Logic**: The summation logic is incorrect. The current implementation does not properly account for the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
