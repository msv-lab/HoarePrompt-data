Postcondition: **Output State: The loop will continue executing until `i` reaches `num2`. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `num2`, and `order` will be incremented each time the condition `a[i-1] >= a[i]` is true. Therefore, `order` will count the number of times an element in the list `a` is greater than or equal to its successor. The final value of `order` is 0.**
