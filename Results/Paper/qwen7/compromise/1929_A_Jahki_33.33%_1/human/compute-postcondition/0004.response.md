Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the array elements, `i` is 1, `num2` must be greater than 1, and order is 1.**

The code `order += 1` increments the value of `order` by 1. Initially, `order` is implied to be 0 (since it is not explicitly defined otherwise), so after executing this line, `order` becomes 1. All other variables (`a`, `i`, and `num2`) remain unchanged.
