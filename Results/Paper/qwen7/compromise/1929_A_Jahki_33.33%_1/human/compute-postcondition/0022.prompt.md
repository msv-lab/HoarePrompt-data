You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the array elements, and num2 is not used in the function and can be ignored.
def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue executing until `i` reaches `num2`. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `num2`, and `order` will be incremented each time the condition `a[i-1] >= a[i]` is true. Therefore, `order` will count the number of times an element in the list `a` is greater than or equal to its successor.
    #
    #In summary, the final output state will be a list `a` of integers, an integer `i` equal to `num2`, and an integer `order` that represents the number of adjacent pairs in the list `a` where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers, and returns `True` in Case_1 or `False` in Case_2.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns True

Case_2: The program returns False


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
