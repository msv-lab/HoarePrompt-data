Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array \(a\) which is defined as the sum of differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

2. To maximize this beauty, we need to sort the array and then calculate the sum of differences between consecutive elements. Sorting ensures that the largest values are paired with the smallest values, maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative ones.

3. The provided code correctly sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

4. The function `func_1` checks if the array is already in non-decreasing order. If it is, the beauty would be 0 because no difference \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) would be positive. However, this function is not used in the main logic, so it doesn't affect the correctness of the solution for the general case where sorting is applied.

5. The main loop iterates over each test case, reads the array, sorts it, and calculates the beauty correctly.

Given these points, the provided program is correct and follows the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
