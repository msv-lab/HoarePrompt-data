### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\), which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - The beauty is maximized when the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are as large as possible.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   - It then checks if the array is already in non-decreasing order using `func_1`.
   - If the array is already in non-decreasing order, the beauty is 0 because the differences are non-negative but not necessarily maximized.
   - Otherwise, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

3. **Checking the Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` checks if the array is in non-decreasing order.
   - This function is correctly implemented and works as expected.

4. **Calculating the Beauty:**
   - The beauty calculation in the main loop is correct. Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest possible differences, maximizing the beauty.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles edge cases like identical elements (e.g., all elements being the same) correctly, resulting in a beauty of 0.
   - The solution also handles small arrays and large values within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting and calculating the differences. The approach is sound and handles all the given test cases accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
