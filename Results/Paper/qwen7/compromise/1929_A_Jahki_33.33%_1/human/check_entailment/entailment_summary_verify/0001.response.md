### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to arrange the array such that the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are as large as possible.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   - It then checks if the array is already in non-decreasing order using `func_1`.
   - If the array is already in non-decreasing order, the beauty is 0 because the differences are non-negative but not necessarily maximized.
   - Otherwise, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

3. **Checking the Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` checks if the array is in non-decreasing order.
   - This function is correctly implemented and works as expected.

4. **Calculating the Beauty:**
   - The beauty calculation in the main loop is correct. Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest possible differences, maximizing the beauty.
   - However, there is a subtle issue with how the beauty is calculated. The current implementation sums the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, which does not always yield the maximum possible beauty.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles edge cases like identical elements (e.g., all elements being the same) correctly, resulting in a beauty of 0.
   - The solution also handles small arrays and large values within the constraints.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Current Implementation:**
  - The current implementation sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
  - This approach does not always yield the maximum possible beauty. For example, consider the array `[1, 3, 2]`. Sorting it gives `[1, 2, 3]`, and the beauty is calculated as \(2 - 1 + 3 - 2 = 2\).
  - However, the optimal arrangement for this array would be `[3, 1, 2]`, giving a beauty of \(3 - 1 + 2 - 3 = 1\).

- **Optimal Approach:**
  - To maximize the beauty, we should pair the smallest and largest elements together. This can be achieved by arranging the array such that the smallest element is paired with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on.
  - For example, for the array `[1, 3, 2]`, the optimal arrangement would be `[3, 1, 2]`, yielding a beauty of \(3 - 1 + 2 - 3 = 1\).

### Conclusion:

The current implementation does not always yield the maximum possible beauty. While it correctly identifies non-decreasing arrays and calculates the beauty for sorted arrays, it does not guarantee the maximum beauty in all cases. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
