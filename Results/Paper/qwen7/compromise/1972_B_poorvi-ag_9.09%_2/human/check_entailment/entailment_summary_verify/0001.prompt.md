You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (number of test cases), a positive integer \( n \) (length of a string), and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it checks if \( n \) is even or if the number of "U"s in \( s \) is greater than the number of "D"s. If \( n \) is even, it appends "no" to the results list; otherwise, it appends "yes" or "no" based on the comparison of "U"s and "D"s. Finally, it prints each element of the results list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves a game where players remove and flip coins based on certain rules. The goal is to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of the coins.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `arr` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - The code checks if `n` is even. If so, it directly appends 'no' to the results list.
   - If `n` is odd, it checks if the number of 'U' (up) coins is greater than the number of 'D' (down) coins. If true, it appends 'yes' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'no'.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The logic for handling even `n` is correct. When `n` is even, Alice will always lose because she will always face an even number of up coins, and the game will eventually force her to make a move that leaves an even number of coins, leading to a losing position.
   - However, the logic for handling odd `n` is flawed. The condition `arr.count('U') > arr.count('D')` does not correctly determine the winner when `n` is odd. This condition only checks if there are more up coins than down coins, but it doesn't account for the optimal strategy of removing and flipping coins.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `5 UUDUD`, the code incorrectly outputs 'no', but the correct output should be 'yes' because Alice can win by strategically choosing coins.
   - For the input `5 UDDUD`, the code correctly outputs 'no'.
   - For the input `2 UU`, the code incorrectly outputs 'no', but the correct output should be 'yes'.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the game's logic for determining the winner, especially for odd `n`. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
