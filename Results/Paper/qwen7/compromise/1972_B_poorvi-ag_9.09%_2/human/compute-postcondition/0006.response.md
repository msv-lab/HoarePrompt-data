Output State: The output state depends on the initial list `results` and the conditions specified in the loop. Since no specific `results` list or `arr` string is provided, we cannot determine the exact output. However, the loop will print each element of the `results` list as it is, without modifying it.

If we assume an example where `results = ['no', 'yes', 'no']` and `arr` is a string like "UUDD", then the loop would print:

```
no
yes
no
```

Output State: ['no', 'yes', 'no'].
