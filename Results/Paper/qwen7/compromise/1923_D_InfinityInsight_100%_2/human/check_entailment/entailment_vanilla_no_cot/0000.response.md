Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the position where an element would fit in a sorted list, but it is not used correctly in the context of the problem. It seems to be trying to find the position of a value in the cumulative sum array `left`, but the logic is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Time**: The logic in `func_2` to calculate the minimum time for each slime to be eaten is incorrect. Specifically, the way it handles the cumulative sum and the logic to determine the minimum time are flawed. For instance, the condition `if a[i] < a[i - 1]:` is not sufficient to determine the minimum time for a slime to be eaten.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Neighbors**: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where a slime eats its neighbor. The logic to determine the next slime to eat and the time taken is not implemented properly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to maintain a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the minimum time each slime takes to be eaten. Hereâ€™s a more accurate implementation:

```python
def min_time_to_eaten_slimes(n, a):
    dp = [0] * n
    stack = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        count = 0
        while stack and a[stack[-1]] < a[i]:
            count += 1
            stack.pop()
        
        if stack:
            dp[i] = dp[stack[-1]] + 1
        
        stack.append(i)
    
    return dp

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = min_time_to_eaten_slimes(n, a)
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

This solution uses a stack to keep track of the indices of the slimes in increasing order of their sizes. For each slime, it calculates the minimum time it takes to be eaten by checking the previous slimes in the stack. This approach ensures that the logic is correctly implemented and handles the problem as described.
