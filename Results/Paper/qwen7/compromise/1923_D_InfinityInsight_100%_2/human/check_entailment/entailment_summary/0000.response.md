Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime. A slime can only eat a neighboring slime if it is strictly larger. The process continues until no more slimes can eat their neighbors.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function is used to find the position of the smallest element in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`. This is not directly relevant to solving the main problem but is used in `func_2`.
   - **func_2**: This function calculates the minimum time for each slime to be eaten. It uses two lists, `left` and `last`, to keep track of cumulative sums and positions of previous different values, respectively. The logic inside the function checks if a slime can eat its left or right neighbor and updates the answer accordingly.

3. **Execution Summary Analysis**:
   - The main code runs `func_2` twice: once on the original list and once on the reversed list. This ensures that the minimum time to be eaten is considered from both directions.
   - For each slime, it takes the maximum of the times calculated from both directions, ensuring the correct minimum time is obtained.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly identifies whether a slime can eat its neighbor and calculates the minimum time.
   - The main code correctly handles the edge cases where a slime might not be able to eat any other slime.
   - The use of `func_1` in `func_2` is necessary for finding the correct position in the cumulative sum list, which is essential for determining the minimum time.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
