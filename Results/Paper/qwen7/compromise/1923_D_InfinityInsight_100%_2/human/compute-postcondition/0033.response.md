Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`; `ans[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `ans[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to `ans[i]`. Since `i` is 1, `ans[1]` is set to 1. The other conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged.
