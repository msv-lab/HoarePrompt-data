Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` remains unchanged, `ans[2]` is 1, `inx2` is `last[1]`, `inx` remains unchanged, `x` is `left[2] - a[2] - 1`**

Explanation: The line `inx2 = last[i - 1]` assigns the value of `last[1]` (since `i` is 2, `i - 1` is 1) to `inx2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
