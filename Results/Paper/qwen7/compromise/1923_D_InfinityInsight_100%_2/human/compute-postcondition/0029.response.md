Output State: The list `last` contains the indices of the first occurrence of each unique element in the list `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to the last element of the list `a`. The list `left` will have its last element increased by the sum of all elements in the list `a`.

In more detail, the list `last` remains unchanged as it only records the first occurrences of unique elements and does not get updated inside the loop. The variable `i` will hold the value of the last element in the list `a` after the loop completes. The list `left` will have its last element updated to be the sum of all elements in the list `a`, as each iteration adds the current element `i` to the last element of `left`.
