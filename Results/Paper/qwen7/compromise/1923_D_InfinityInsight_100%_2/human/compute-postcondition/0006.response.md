Output State: **`i` is appended to the list `last`, `n` must be at least 2, the value of `a[i]` is not equal to the value of `a[i - 1]`.**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `last`. Since `i` was initially 1, now `1` is part of the list `last`. The conditions for `n` and the values of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` remain unchanged.
