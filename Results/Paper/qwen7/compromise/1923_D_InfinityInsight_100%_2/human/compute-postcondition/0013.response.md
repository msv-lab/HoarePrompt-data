Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `last` has its last element appended to itself**

Explanation: The code `last.append(last[-1])` appends the last element of the list `last` to itself. This means that the length of the list `last` increases by one, and the new element is a copy of the previous last element. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state, with `i` being incremented to 2 and `n` still being at least 2 for the loop to continue.
