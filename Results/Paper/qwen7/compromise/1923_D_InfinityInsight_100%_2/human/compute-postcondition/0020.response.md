Output State: The list `last` will contain the indices of the positions in the list `a` where the value changes. Specifically, `last` will end up being a list of length `n` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of that value in `a`.

For example, if `a` is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3]`, then `last` will be `[1, 2, 5]`. This means that the value `1` lasts until index `1`, the value `2` lasts until index `2`, and the value `3` lasts until the end of the list at index `5`.

If `a` is a list where all elements are the same, like `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, then `last` will simply be a list of the same length filled with the index `n-1`, because the value does not change and thus the last occurrence of the value is always at the last index. For instance, `last` would be `[3, 3, 3, 3]` for `n=4`.

In summary, the final state of `last` will capture the last index where each distinct value in `a` appears, ensuring that even if a value repeats, the last index is recorded.
