Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in a:`, where `a` is a list and `i` is the variable that will take on the values from the list `a`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Variables:**
   - The initial state given is that `last` is a list containing the indices of the first occurrence of each unique element in the list `a`.
   - `i` is initially set to `n`.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop depends on the list `a` and the variable `i`, these are the only variables that need to be adjusted.
   - `i` will take on the values from the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.
   - Therefore, `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `a` must contain at least one element.
- `i` must be set to the first element of the list `a`.

Thus, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`last` is a list containing the indices of the first occurrence of each unique element in the list `a`, `i` is the first element of the list `a`, and the list `a` must contain at least one element.**
