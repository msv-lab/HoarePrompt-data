Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`; `ans[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated or affected by the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain the same as their initial states. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.
