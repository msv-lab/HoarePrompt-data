Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of n integers representing the sizes of the slimes, and an integer `n` indicating the length of the list. It returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` (for i from 1 to n-1) is calculated based on the value of `inx` determined by the logic inside the loop: if `inx` is less than or equal to 0, then `ans[i] = 2 - inx`; otherwise, `ans[i] = i + 1 - inx`. Additionally, the last element of the list `left` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.**
