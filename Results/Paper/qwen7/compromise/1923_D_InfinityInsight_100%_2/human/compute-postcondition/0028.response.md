Output State: The list `last` contains the indices of the first occurrence of each unique element in the list `a`, `i` is the last element of the list `a`, and `left` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` up to that index.

To explain further, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `last` remains unchanged as it was initialized before the loop and does not get modified within the loop. The variable `i` becomes the last element of the list `a` since the loop iterates over each element in `a` exactly once, setting `i` to the current element on each iteration. The list `left` is constructed such that each element is the sum of all previous elements in `a`, starting from 0 (or whatever the initial value of `left` was before the loop started).
