Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Spending**: The logic for calculating the minimum spending is flawed. Specifically, the current implementation incorrectly calculates the cost by subtracting `s * s / 2` which does not align with the problem statement. The problem requires considering the cumulative effect of purchasing tickets on future days' prices.

2. **Sorting the List**: Sorting the list of ticket prices (`l.sort()`) before processing is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results because the order of days matters in this problem.

3. **Incorrect Formula for Cost Calculation**: The formula `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is not correct according to the problem's rules. The cost should be calculated based on the actual number of tickets purchased and the adjusted prices for subsequent days.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to use a dynamic programming approach or a greedy strategy that considers the cumulative effect of purchasing tickets on future days' prices. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        m = int(data[index + 1])
        k = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3

        prices = [int(data[index + i]) for i in range(n)]
        index += n

        dp = [float('inf')] * (k + 1)
        dp[0] = 0

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(k, 0, -1):
                if j >= m:
                    dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j - m] + prices[i] * m)
                else:
                    dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j - 1] + prices[i] * j)

        results.append(min(dp))

    for result in results:
        print(result)


func()
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum cost to buy up to `j` tickets considering the prices and adjustments for future days. This approach ensures that the solution adheres to the problem constraints and correctly calculates the minimum spending.
