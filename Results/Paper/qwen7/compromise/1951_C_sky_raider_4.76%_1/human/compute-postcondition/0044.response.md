Output State: **`i` is an input integer, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, and `k` is the third input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variable `i` is initialized to the first input integer using `i = int(input())`. The initial condition that `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to `n` is now satisfied by the assignment of `i` to the first input integer. Therefore, `i` remains the first input integer, and `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the next three integers entered.
