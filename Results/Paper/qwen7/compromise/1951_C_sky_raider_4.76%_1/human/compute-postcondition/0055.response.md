Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - s`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by `s`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `s` is still the minimum value between `m` and `k`, but since `k` has been updated, `s` might also change if `m` is less than the new value of `k`. However, the exact value of `s` is not specified, so we keep it as `s = min(m, k)`.
