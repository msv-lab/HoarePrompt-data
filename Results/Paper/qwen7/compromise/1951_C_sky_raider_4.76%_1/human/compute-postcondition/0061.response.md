Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `c` is the sum of `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for all `i` in the range of `n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `c` will hold the cumulative value of `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`. The conditions for the loop to execute, such as `n` being greater than 0, remain unchanged.
