Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`, and since `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is at the end of the range defined by `n`.
- `c` is the sum of `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. This means `c` has accumulated the value of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration of `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `k` is `k - n * s`, indicating that `k` has been reduced by `n * s` over the course of the loop.
- `s` is `min(m, k - n * s)`, meaning `s` is updated at the start of each iteration as the minimum of `m` and the remaining value of `k`.

Given these details, the print statement `print(int(c))` will output the integer value of `c`.

Output: **int(c)**
