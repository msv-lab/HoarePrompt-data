Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `b` is a new list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`, `count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 0, `d` is `k // 2`.**

The value of `d` is calculated as `k // 2`, which means `d` is the integer division of `k` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
