Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was a positive integer in the initial state.
