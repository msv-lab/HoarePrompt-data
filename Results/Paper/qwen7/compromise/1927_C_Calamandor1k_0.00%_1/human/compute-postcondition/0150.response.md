Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes positive integers \(n\) and \(m\), an even integer \(k\), and two arrays \(a\) and \(b\). It counts the number of elements in arrays \(a\) and \(b\) that are less than or equal to \(k\). If the count of such elements in both arrays is at least \(\frac{k}{2}\), the function outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.**
