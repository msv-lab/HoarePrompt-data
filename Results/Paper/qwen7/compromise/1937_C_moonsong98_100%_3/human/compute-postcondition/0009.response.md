Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `0, n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 (the start of the range `0, n`).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0 and that `n` is a positive integer allowing the loop to execute.

5. **Consider the Given States**:
   - `max_index` is the largest value of `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
   - `min_indices` is a list containing the value of `max_index`.

6. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being 0, `max_index` should be set to 0 initially because it is the largest value of `i` for which the condition holds true when `i` is 0.
   - `min_indices` should contain this initial value of `max_index`, which is 0.
   - `n` must be a positive integer to allow the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`max_index` is 0, `min_indices` is [0], `n` must be greater than 0**
