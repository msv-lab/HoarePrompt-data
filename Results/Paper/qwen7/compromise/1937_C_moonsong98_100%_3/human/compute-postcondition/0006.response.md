Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The variable `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is an integer equal to the input integer, where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\) and \(n \neq 2\).
- `max_index` is 0 (this variable is not used in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted).

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`. Since `n` is given to be within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\) and \(n \neq 2\), the smallest possible value for `n` is 3.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1, and `i` starts from 0.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `i` must be 0.

So, the state should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
