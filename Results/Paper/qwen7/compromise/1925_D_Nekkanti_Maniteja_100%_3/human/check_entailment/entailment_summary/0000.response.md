Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Combinatorial Calculation**: The variable `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is necessary for the combinatorial calculations.
3. **Summation of Friendship Values**: The program correctly sums up the friendship values \(f_i\) for all given pairs of friends.
4. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value calculation seems to be based on the formula \(s = c \times i \times c \times m + c \times a\), where \(i\) ranges from 0 to \(k-1\). However, this formula needs to be verified against the problem statement.
5. **Modular Arithmetic**: All calculations are performed under modular arithmetic using \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct.

Let's verify the formula used in the program:

- For each excursion, the probability of choosing any specific pair of friends is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
- The expected increase in friendship value for a pair of friends after \(k\) excursions is \(k\).

Given that there are \(m\) pairs of friends, the expected total increase in friendship values is \(m \times k\).

However, the program's formula \(s = c \times i \times c \times m + c \times a\) does not directly reflect this expected value calculation. Instead, it seems to be attempting to incorporate some form of combinatorial adjustment, but it is not clear how this formula aligns with the problem statement.

To ensure correctness, we need to compare the program's logic with the expected mathematical formulation. The program should calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \(k\) pairs chosen for the excursions, which is \(m \times k\).

Given the discrepancy between the expected value calculation and the provided formula, the program's logic appears to be incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
