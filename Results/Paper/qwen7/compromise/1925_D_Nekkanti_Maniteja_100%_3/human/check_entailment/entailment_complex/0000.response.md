Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes `M` as \(10^9 + 7\) and calculates the modular multiplicative inverse `c` of \(\frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\).

2. **Computation of Expected Value**:
   - The variable `a` is initialized to 0 and is used to accumulate the sum of friendship values `f_i` for all pairs.
   - For each of the `m` pairs, the program adds the friendship value `f_i` to `a`.

3. **Calculation of Expected Sum**:
   - The main computation happens in the loop that runs `k` times.
   - In each iteration, the program updates `s` using the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - This formula seems to be an attempt to compute the expected sum of friendship values considering the probability of choosing each pair and the increase in friendship values over time.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - All operations are performed under modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Analysis of the Formula

The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` needs careful examination:

- `c * i * c * m` accounts for the expected contribution of each pair being chosen multiple times.
- `c * a` accounts for the initial sum of friendship values.

However, the formula `c * (i + m) * c * (i + m) * (m - (i - k + 1)) + c * a * m` mentioned in the comment is not present in the code. This suggests that the formula might be incorrect or incomplete.

### Correctness Check

Given the problem statement and the example provided, the program should correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. However, the current implementation does not seem to fully capture the correct logic for the expected value calculation.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The formula used in the loop does not match the required logic for calculating the expected sum of friendship values.

Correctness: **False**
