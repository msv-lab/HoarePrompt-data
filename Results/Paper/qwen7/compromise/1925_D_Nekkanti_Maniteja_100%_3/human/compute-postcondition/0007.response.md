Output State: **`u`, `v`, and `f` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts based on spaces, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. Since the actual values of the input are not specified, we can only state that `u`, `v`, and `f` are now holding integer values from the input.
