Output State: `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is the sum of `a` plus `f` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=m-1`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `u` and `v` will retain their values from the last input provided during the third iteration, `f` will also hold the value from the last input provided during the third iteration. The variable `a` will contain the cumulative sum of all `f` values provided as inputs over all iterations of the loop, which is `a + f` for each `i` from `0` to `m-1`.
