Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo 1000000007, `s` is 0, `a` is 0.**

The code initializes `a` to 0. Since `a` was not previously defined, it is now set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
