Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4), followed by integers n, m, and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5). Additionally, it processes m lines of input, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i (a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns information based on the processed data, ensuring all pairs of friends are distinct and the sums of n, m, and k meet specified constraints.**

This means the function is designed to handle a series of test cases, each with specific parameters and additional structured data inputs, without accepting any parameters directly.
