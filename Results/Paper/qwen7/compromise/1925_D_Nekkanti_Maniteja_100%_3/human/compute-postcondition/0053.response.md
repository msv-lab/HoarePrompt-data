Output State: **`M` is 1000000007, `n` is the initial input integer, `m` is the initial input integer, `k` is the initial input integer, `i` is `k + 1`, `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = k-1`, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, and `a` is the sum of `f` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = k-1`.**

Explanation: The line `M = 10 ** 9 + 7` assigns the value 1000000007 to the variable `M`. This changes the value of `M` but does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `s`, `c`, or `a`. The value of `i` is updated to `k + 1` due to the increment operation, but the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The expressions for `s`, `c`, and `a` remain as they were, just with their dependencies on the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
