Output State: **`u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is 0, `i` is `m`, `k` is `m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `a = 0` sets the variable `a` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
