Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. Since the input to `int(input())` must be an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive, `n`, `m`, and `k` are also constrained to be within this range. The value of `t` remains unchanged.
