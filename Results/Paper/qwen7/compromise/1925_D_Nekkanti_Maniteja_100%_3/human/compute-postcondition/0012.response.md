Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - From the given state, we know that `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
   - `m` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `i < m`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i_prev + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`.

4. **Update the states**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i_prev + 2`.
   - `m` remains the same as it did not change during the iteration.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `u` is updated with the first input integer.
   - `v` is updated with the second input integer.
   - `f` is updated with the third input integer.
   - `i` becomes `i_prev + 2`.
   - `m` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is `a + f`, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `m` is `m_prev`, `u` is updated with the first input integer, `v` is updated with the second input integer, `f` is updated with the third input integer**.
