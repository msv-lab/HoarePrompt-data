Output State: **`u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is the cumulative sum of `f` added for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=m-1`, `i` is `m-1`, `k` is `m`, `s` is `s + c * (m-1) * c * m + c * a`**.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `u` will still be the first input integer, `v` will still be the second input integer, and `f` will still be the third input integer. The variable `a` will hold the cumulative sum of all integers `f` provided as input over the course of the loop's iterations. The variable `i` will be equal to `m-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `k` will retain its initial value `m`. The variable `s` will be updated to `s + c * (m-1) * c * m + c * a`, reflecting the final summation within the loop.
