Output State: **`i` is `k + 3`, `m` must be greater than `k + 3`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
