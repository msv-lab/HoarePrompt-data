Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo 1000000007.**

Explanation: The code calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\) (where \(M = 1000000007\)) and assigns it to `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `M` remain unchanged. The value of `c` is specifically the modular multiplicative inverse, which means that when `c` is multiplied by \(\frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\), the result is congruent to 1 modulo \(M\).
