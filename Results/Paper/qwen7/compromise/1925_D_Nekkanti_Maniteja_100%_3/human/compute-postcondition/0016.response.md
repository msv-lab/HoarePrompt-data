Output State: `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is the sum of `f` added for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=m-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, `u` will be the first input integer, `v` will be the second input integer, `f` will be the third input integer, and `a` will be the cumulative sum of all integers `f` provided as input over the course of the loop's iterations. The variable `i` will be equal to `m-1`, and `m` will retain its initial value.
