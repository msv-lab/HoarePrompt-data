Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo 1000000007, `s` is 0.**

The code initializes `s` to 0, which does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, or `c`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `s` is updated to 0.
