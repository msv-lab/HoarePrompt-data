Output State: **`a` is `a + f`, `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `i` is less than `m`, `k` is `m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `a` is incremented by the value of `f`. All other variables retain their initial or unchanged states.
