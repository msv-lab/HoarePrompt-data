The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a binary string `arr`. It checks if the count of '1's in `arr` is 2 and if '11' is a substring of `arr`. If either of these conditions is met, it appends 'no' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'yes'. After processing all test cases, it prints the results list, which contains 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on the conditions checked.
