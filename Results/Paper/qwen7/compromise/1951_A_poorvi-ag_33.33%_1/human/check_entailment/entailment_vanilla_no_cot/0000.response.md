Correctness: **False**

The provided program `func` does not match the problem description. The problem description asks for a Python program that generates `.py` files (`ac.py` and `wa.py`) for each `.html` file found in specified subfolders of the current directory. However, the given program `func` is designed to process input related to counting occurrences of the digit '1' in strings and appending results to a list. These functionalities are unrelated to the task described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.
