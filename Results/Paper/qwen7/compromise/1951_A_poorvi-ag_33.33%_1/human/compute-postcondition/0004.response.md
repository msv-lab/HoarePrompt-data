Output State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, and `t` is an input integer; `results` is a list containing strings 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions checked for each input `n` and its corresponding string `arr`. The length of the `results` list is equal to the value of `t`. For each iteration, if the count of '1's in `arr` is 2 and '11' is a substring of `arr`, the result is 'no'. If the count of '1's is even and the above condition is met, the result is also 'no', otherwise it is 'yes'. If the count of '1's is odd, the result is 'no'.
