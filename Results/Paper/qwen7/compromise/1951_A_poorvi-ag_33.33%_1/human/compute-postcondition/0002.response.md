Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variables that are used within the loop. In this case, the loop uses the variable `i` and the value `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `start` is an integer.
   - `end` is an integer.
   - `t` is an input integer.
   - `results` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `t` iterations, where `i` takes values from 0 to `t-1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because the loop runs `t` times.
   - The initial value of `i` should be set to 0 since the loop starts with `i = 0`.

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the states of `t` and `i` to ensure the loop can execute. The other variables (`start`, `end`, and `results`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and can remain as they are.

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`t` must be a positive integer, `i` is 0**
