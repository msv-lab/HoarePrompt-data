Output State: `results` is a list containing strings 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions checked for each input `n` and its corresponding string `arr`. For each iteration, if the count of '1's in `arr` is 2 and '11' is a substring of `arr`, the result is 'no'. If the count of '1's is even and the above condition is met, the result is also 'no', otherwise it is 'yes'. If the count of '1's is odd, the result is 'no'. The loop prints each element in the `results` list after evaluating the conditions for each input.
