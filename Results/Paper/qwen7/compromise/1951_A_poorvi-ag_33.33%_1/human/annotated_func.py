#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and end are integers such that start <= end, and both represent valid directory names without leading zeros.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
            results.append('no')
        
        if arr.count('1') % 2 == 0:
            if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
                results.append('no')
            else:

    #State: Output State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, and `t` is an input integer; `results` is a list containing strings 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions checked for each input `n` and its corresponding string `arr`. The length of the `results` list is equal to the value of `t`. For each iteration, if the count of '1's in `arr` is 2 and '11' is a substring of `arr`, the result is 'no'. If the count of '1's is even and the above condition is met, the result is also 'no', otherwise it is 'yes'. If the count of '1's is odd, the result is 'no'.
    for r in results:
        print(r)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing strings 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions checked for each input `n` and its corresponding string `arr`. For each iteration, if the count of '1's in `arr` is 2 and '11' is a substring of `arr`, the result is 'no'. If the count of '1's is even and the above condition is met, the result is also 'no', otherwise it is 'yes'. If the count of '1's is odd, the result is 'no'. The loop prints each element in the `results` list after evaluating the conditions for each input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a binary string `arr`. It checks if the count of '1's in `arr` is 2 and if '11' is a substring of `arr`. If either of these conditions is met, it appends 'no' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'yes'. After processing all test cases, it prints the results list, which contains 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on the conditions checked.
