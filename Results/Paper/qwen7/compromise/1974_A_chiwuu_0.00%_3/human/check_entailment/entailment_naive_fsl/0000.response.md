Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. Specifically, the logic for calculating `t` and `t1` does not accurately reflect the constraints and requirements of the problem.

For instance, consider the following input:
- `x = 12` (number of 1x1 icons)
- `y = 4` (number of 2x2 icons)

According to the problem description, we need to fit these icons into 5x3 grids. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so 4 such icons will occupy 16 cells. Since each grid has 15 cells, we need at least 2 grids to fit all the icons. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed.

Let's break down the issues:
1. The calculation `t = b * 2` and subsequent division and subtraction steps do not correctly account for the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
2. The logic for determining the number of remaining cells (`t1`) and further calculations do not properly handle the placement of 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons.

To verify this, let's manually check the example:
- We need to fit 12 1x1 icons and 4 2x2 icons.
- 4 2x2 icons occupy 16 cells, which requires 2 grids since each grid has 15 cells.
- After placing 4 2x2 icons, we have 12 - (4 * 4) = 4 cells left to place the remaining 1x1 icons.
- These 4 cells can be placed in one additional grid, making the total number of grids needed 2.

However, the program incorrectly calculates this and outputs 1 instead of 2.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that the correctness is **False**.
