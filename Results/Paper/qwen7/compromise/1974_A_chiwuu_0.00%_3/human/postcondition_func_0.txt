The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers: t, x, and y. For each test case, it calculates an integer t based on the values of x and y, ensuring t remains within the range of 1 to 10^4. It updates t according to specific conditions involving arithmetic operations and prints the final value of t for each test case.
