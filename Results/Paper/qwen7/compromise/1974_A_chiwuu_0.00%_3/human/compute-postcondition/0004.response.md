Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two integers t, x, and y. For each test case, t represents the number of subsequent cases to process, and x and y are integers within the range of 0 to 99. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.**

Given the constraints and the structure of the problem, it appears the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing three integers (t, x, y), where t indicates the number of such triplets to process. However, without explicit return statements provided, it's inferred that the function processes these test cases internally but does not return any value back to the caller.
