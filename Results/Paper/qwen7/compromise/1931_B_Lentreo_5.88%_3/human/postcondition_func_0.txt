The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) indicating the number of cases, then for each case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers. It calculates the sum of all non-zero elements in the list, subtracting the last element of the list, and checks if this value is zero. If it is zero, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
