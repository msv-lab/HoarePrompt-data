Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `t` is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) remains valid after the code is executed, and the value of `t` is now known and stored as an integer.
