Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in `nums` minus the initial value of `last`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all iterations, `curr` will have been updated in each iteration where the current element `i` is not zero. Specifically, for each non-zero element `i` in `nums`, `curr` is incremented by `i - last`. The final value of `curr` is thus the sum of all non-zero elements in `nums` minus the initial value of `last`. The variable `t` will be equal to its initial value minus the total number of iterations, which is the length of `nums`. The variables `n` and `last` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
