Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `last` is the last element of the list `nums`.**

The code assigns the last element of the list `nums` to the variable `last`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged.
