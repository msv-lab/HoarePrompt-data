Output State: **`last` is the last element of the updated `nums` list, `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the updated `nums` list minus the last element of the updated `nums` list.**

Explanation: The code assigns the last element of the updated `nums` list to the variable `last`. The value of `curr` remains unchanged as no operation is performed on it within the given code snippet. Therefore, `curr` is still the sum of all non-zero elements in the original `nums` list minus the initial value of `last`.
