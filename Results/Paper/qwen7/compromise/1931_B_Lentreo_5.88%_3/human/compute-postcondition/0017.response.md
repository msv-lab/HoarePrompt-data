Output State: **`curr` is updated to its previous value plus `i - last`, `i` is the next element from `nums`.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is updated by adding the difference between the current element `i` from the list `nums` and the last element `last` to its previous value. The list `nums` remains unchanged, and `i` is now set to the next element in the list after the current one.
