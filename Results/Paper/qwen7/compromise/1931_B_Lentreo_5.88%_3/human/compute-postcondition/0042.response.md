Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nums` is a non-empty list.
   - `curr` is updated based on the condition: if the second element of `nums` (`i`) is not 0, then `curr` is updated to the original value of `curr` plus `i` minus `last`. If `i` is 0, `curr` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `nums`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - We need to determine the state of `nums` and `curr` for the next iteration.
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element of `nums`, the list `nums` itself does not change; it still contains the same elements as before.
   - For `curr`, we need to consider the condition under which it was updated. However, since we are looking at the state before the update (or the state for the next iteration), we assume `curr` remains unchanged unless explicitly updated in the loop body.

Given these points, let's summarize the state adjustments:

- `nums` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration.
- `curr` remains unchanged because we are considering the state before the update or for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`nums` is a non-empty list, and `curr` remains unchanged.**
