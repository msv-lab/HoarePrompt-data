Postcondition: `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the updated `nums` list minus the last element of the updated `nums` list. If `i` is not zero, `curr` is further updated to include `i` minus the last element of the updated `nums` list. If `i` is zero, `curr` remains unchanged. `i` is the next element in the `nums` list, and `nums` is the updated list.
