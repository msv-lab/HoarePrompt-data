Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty list, `i` is an integer not equal to 0, `curr` is `curr + (i - last)`**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is updated by adding the expression `i - last` to its current value. The values of `nums` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `last` is used in the calculation but its specific value is not provided, so it remains as part of the expression.
