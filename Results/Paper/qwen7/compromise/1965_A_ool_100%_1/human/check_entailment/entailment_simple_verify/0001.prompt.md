You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of arr (n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Each integer in the list represents the initial number of stones in a pile and satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.

    if (set_[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'

    #State: Output State: `A` is True, `not_c` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates through the elements of `set_` starting from the second element. If the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1, `not_c` is set to False and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `A` toggles between True and False with each iteration. Since the loop starts from `i=1`, it will check the difference between each pair of consecutive elements (i and i-1). If no such pair exists where the difference is greater than 1, `not_c` remains True, but since the loop will eventually break when the condition is met, `not_c` becomes False. The value of `A` will be True if the number of iterations is even, and False if it's odd. Given the loop starts from `i=1` and goes up to `len(set_) - 1`, the number of iterations is always one less than the length of `set_`, which means `A` will be True if the length of `set_` is even, and False if it's odd. However, without knowing the exact length of `set_`, we can only definitively say that `not_c` will be False if the condition `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1` is ever met during the loop.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: `A` is True if the length of `set_` is even, and False if it's odd. `not_c` is False if the difference between any two consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice' if the length of set_ is even, and 'Bob' if it's odd.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles into an array `arr`.

2. **Calling the Function:**
   - The program calls the function `func_1` to determine the winner for each test case.
   - The function `func_1` takes the array `arr` as input and returns the winner.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function starts by converting the array to a set and sorting it.
   - It checks if the smallest element in the sorted array is not 1. If so, it directly returns "Alice".
   - Otherwise, it iterates through the sorted unique elements and checks the differences between consecutive elements.
   - If any difference is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to `False`.
   - It alternates the boolean value `A` for each element.
   - Finally, it returns "Alice" if `A` is `True`, otherwise "Bob".

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Initial Check:**
   - The check `if set_[0] != 1:` is correct because if the smallest pile has more than 1 stone, Alice can always reduce it to 1 stone, making the game simpler. This ensures Alice can force a win.

2. **Difference Check:**
   - The loop `for i in range(1, len(set_)):` correctly identifies if there are any gaps between the sizes of the piles that are more than 1. If such a gap exists, it means Bob can always reduce the game to a simpler state where he can force a win.

3. **Alternating Boolean:**
   - The alternating logic `A = not A` is used to simulate the optimal moves of both players. If the sequence of pile sizes forms a pattern where every two consecutive piles differ by exactly 1, the game will alternate between Alice and Bob until one of them is forced to lose.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - The final decision is made based on the value of `A`. If `A` is `True`, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles edge cases like multiple piles of the same size and varying sizes correctly.
- The function works as expected for different test cases provided in the example.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the problem statement and the provided examples.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
