Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles into an array `arr`.

2. **Calling the Function:**
   - The program calls the function `func_1` to determine the winner for each test case.
   - The function `func_1` takes the array `arr` as input and returns the winner.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function starts by converting the array to a set and sorting it.
   - It checks if the smallest element in the sorted array is not 1. If so, it directly returns "Alice".
   - Otherwise, it iterates through the sorted unique elements and checks the differences between consecutive elements.
   - If any difference is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to `False`.
   - It alternates the boolean value `A` for each element.
   - Finally, it returns "Alice" if `A` is `True`, otherwise "Bob".

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Initial Check:**
   - The check `if set_[0] != 1:` is correct because if the smallest pile has more than 1 stone, Alice can always reduce it to 1 stone, making the game simpler. This ensures Alice can force a win.

2. **Difference Check:**
   - The loop `for i in range(1, len(set_)):` correctly identifies if there are any gaps between the sizes of the piles that are more than 1. If such a gap exists, it means Bob can always reduce the game to a simpler state where he can force a win.

3. **Alternating Boolean:**
   - The alternating logic `A = not A` is used to simulate the optimal moves of both players. If the sequence of pile sizes forms a pattern where every two consecutive piles differ by exactly 1, the game will alternate between Alice and Bob until one of them is forced to lose.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - The final decision is made based on the value of `A`. If `A` is `True`, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles edge cases like multiple piles of the same size and varying sizes correctly.
- The function works as expected for different test cases provided in the example.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the problem statement and the provided examples.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
