Output State: **`A` is False, `not_c` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `A = not A` changes the value of `A` from its original state (which could be either `True` or `False`) to the opposite. Since `not_c` and `set_` are not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged. The first element of `set_` being 1 and `set_` containing unique elements sorted in ascending order from `arr` are also preserved.
