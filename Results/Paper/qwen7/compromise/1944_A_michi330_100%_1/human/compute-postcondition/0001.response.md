State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, `i` is 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 (since the range function starts from 0 and goes up to but not including `t`).
- The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

Since `t` determines whether the loop will execute, it must be adjusted to ensure the loop can run. The initial value of `i` is set to 0 as per the loop definition.
