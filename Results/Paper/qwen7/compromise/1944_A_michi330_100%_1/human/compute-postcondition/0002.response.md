Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either '1' or 'n', where 'n' is the value of the input integer `n` for each iteration. Specifically, for each input pair (n, k) where k >= n - 1, the output will be '1', and for each (n, k) where k < n - 1, the output will be 'n'. The total number of lines will be equal to the value of `t`.
