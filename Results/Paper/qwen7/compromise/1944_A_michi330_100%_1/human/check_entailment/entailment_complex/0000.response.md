Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys up to `k` bridges.
- The provided function `func()` correctly handles the logic for each test case:
  - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, Everule cannot visit more than one island (only island 1).
  - Otherwise, Everule can visit all `n` islands.
- The function reads the number of test cases `t`, then iterates through each test case, reading `n` and `k`, and printing the appropriate result based on the condition.
- The function correctly handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
