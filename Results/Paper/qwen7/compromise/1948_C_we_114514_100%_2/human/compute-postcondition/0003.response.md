Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Identify the objects in the loop head:
   - The loop uses `_` as the iterator variable, which is a common practice when the value of the iterator is not needed within the loop body.
   - The loop also uses the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases.

2. Determine the conditions for the loop to execute:
   - The loop will execute for each value in the range defined by `t`.
   - For the loop to start, `t` must be at least 1 because the range function in Python generates values from 0 to `t-1`.

3. Adjust the states accordingly:
   - Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution, we don't need to adjust anything related to it.
   - We need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 so that the loop can start executing.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, results is an empty list**
