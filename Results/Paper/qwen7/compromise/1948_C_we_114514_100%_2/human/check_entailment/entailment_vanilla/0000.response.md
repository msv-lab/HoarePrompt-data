Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the robot can reach cell `(2, n)` starting from `(1, 1)`.
   - It takes three parameters: `n` (number of columns), `row1` (first row of the grid), and `row2` (second row of the grid).
   - The function iterates through the middle of the grid (i.e., from column 2 to `n-1` in steps of 2).

2. **Loop in `func_1`**:
   - For each column index `2*i + 1` (where `i` ranges from `0` to `half_n - 1`), it checks if the arrow in the first row at this column is `<` (left).
   - If the arrow is `<`, it checks if the corresponding columns in the second row (i.e., `2*i` and `2*i + 2`) have arrows pointing left (`<`).
   - If both conditions are met, it returns `'No'` immediately because the robot cannot move past these columns.
   - After the loop, it checks the last column separately if necessary.

3. **Final Check**:
   - If the loop completes without returning `'No'`, it checks the last column:
     - If the arrow in the first row at column `n-1` is `<`, and the arrow in the second row at column `n-2` is also `<`, it returns `'No'`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `'Yes'`.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results joined by newline characters.

### Verification

To verify the correctness of the program, let's consider the examples provided in the problem statement:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Grid: `>>><`
   - Second row: `>>><`
   - Path: (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4)
   - Result: `YES`

2. **Example 2**:
   - Grid: `><`
   - Second row: `><`
   - Path: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2)
   - Result: `YES`

3. **Example 3**:
   - Grid: `>>><`
   - Second row: `><<<`
   - There is no path to (2, 4).
   - Result: `NO`

4. **Example 4**:
   - Grid: `>><<><`
   - Second row: `><>>><`
   - Path: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6)
   - Result: `YES`

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and verifying it against the provided examples, we can conclude that the program correctly determines whether the robot can reach cell `(2, n)`.

**Correctness: True**
