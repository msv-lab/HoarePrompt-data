Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` based on the movement rules defined by the arrows in the grid.
   - It iterates through the first half of the grid (up to `half_n - 1`) and checks if the robot can be blocked from reaching the last column by certain configurations of arrows.
   - If the robot encounters a specific configuration (arrow pointing left in the middle of the grid and corresponding arrows in the next cells pointing left), it returns 'No'.
   - After the loop, it checks the last few cells to ensure the robot can reach the end. If the last cell in `row1` or the second last cell in `row2` points left, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the dimensions `n`, and the two rows of the grid (`row1` and `row2`).
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the result in a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the conditions under which the robot cannot reach the cell `(2, n)`. Specifically, it checks for configurations that would block the robot from moving to the last column.
   - The implementation in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotated program, the logic appears to be correct and matches the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
