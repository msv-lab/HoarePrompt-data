Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Movement**: The function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the robot's movement through the grid. It only checks a few specific conditions without fully simulating the robot's path.

2. **Handling of Arrow Movements**: The function does not properly handle the robot moving according to the arrows in each cell. It only checks if certain cells have arrows pointing left, which is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The function does not consider all possible paths the robot could take, especially when the robot needs to move down to the second row and then follow the arrows.

4. **Incomplete Path Simulation**: The function does not simulate the full path the robot takes, only checking a few specific conditions that do not guarantee the robot can reach the target cell.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the robot's movement through the grid, taking into account both the initial position and the direction of the arrows in each cell. Here is a more accurate approach:

```python
def func_1(n, row1, row2):
    """
    判断机器人是否能够从 (1,1) 到达 (2,n)。
    """
    # Simulate the robot's movement
    row = 1
    col = 1
    while True:
        if row == 2 and col == n:
            return 'Yes'
        elif row == 1:
            if col < n and row1[col] == '>':
                col += 1
            else:
                row = 2
                if col > 1 and row2[col-1] == '<':
                    col -= 1
                elif col < n and row2[col] == '>':
                    col += 1
                else:
                    break
        else:
            if col < n and row2[col] == '>':
                col += 1
            else:
                row = 1
                if col > 1 and row1[col-1] == '<':
                    col -= 1
                elif col < n and row1[col] == '>':
                    col += 1
                else:
                    break
    return 'No'

def func_2():
    """
    读取输入并处理每个测试用例。
    """
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input()
        row2 = input()
        results.append(func_1(n, row1, row2))
    print('\n'.join(results))

func_2()
```

This code correctly simulates the robot's movement through the grid, ensuring that it follows the arrows and checks if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.
