### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis
The problem requires determining if a robot starting at (1, 1) can reach (2, n) by moving according to the arrows in the grid. The robot can move left, right, up, or down, but it cannot leave the grid. The arrows point either left or right, and the robot always moves according to the arrow in its current cell.

#### Code Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function checks specific conditions to determine if the robot can reach (2, n).
   - It iterates through the first half of the grid (up to `half_n - 1`) and checks if the robot can get stuck in a loop.
   - If the robot encounters a left arrow (`<`) in the first row and both adjacent cells in the second row also have left arrows, it returns 'No'.
   - After the loop, it checks if the last cell in the first row is a left arrow and the second-to-last cell in the second row is a left arrow. If both are true, it returns 'No'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - Collects the results and prints them.

#### Annotated Code Review
- The function `func_1` is checking for specific conditions that might cause the robot to get stuck in a loop. However, these conditions are not comprehensive enough to cover all scenarios where the robot cannot reach (2, n).
- The conditions checked in `func_1` are:
  - If the robot encounters a left arrow in the first row and both adjacent cells in the second row also have left arrows.
  - If the last cell in the first row is a left arrow and the second-to-last cell in the second row is a left arrow.
- These conditions do not cover all possible scenarios where the robot might get trapped in a loop or fail to reach (2, n).

#### Counterexample
Consider the input:
```
4
><>>
<<>
```
- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It moves right to (1, 2) and the arrow in (1, 2) points left, so it moves back to (1, 1).
- It repeats this cycle, and the robot cannot escape the first row.
- According to the function, it returns 'Yes', which is incorrect.

#### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle all cases where the robot cannot reach (2, n). The provided counterexample demonstrates that the function fails to detect some valid cases where the robot gets stuck in a loop.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
