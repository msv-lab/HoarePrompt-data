Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < k // 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `i_prev + 2`
   - `k` must be `k // 2` or greater
   - `a[d]` is decreased by 1
   - `d` is decreased by 1
   - `g` is increased by 1 if `a[g]` is not zero
   - `a[d]` is set to 0 if it was originally 0
   - Exception handling: If an exception occurs, the loop or the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < k // 2`, we need to check if the current value of `i` (which is `i_prev + 2`) is still less than `k // 2`.
   - If `i_prev + 2 < k // 2`, the loop can continue. Otherwise, it cannot.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i_prev + 3`.
   - `k` remains unchanged and must still be `k // 2` or greater.

6. **Final state**:
   - `i` is `i_prev + 3`
   - `k` must be `k // 2` or greater

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is `i_prev + 3`, `k` must be `k // 2` or greater**
