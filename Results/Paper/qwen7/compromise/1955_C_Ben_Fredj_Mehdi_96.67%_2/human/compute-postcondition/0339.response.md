Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers. If `n` is 2, `k` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting right after the first space, and `k` equals `a[0] - 1` and `k` equals `a[1] - 2`, then `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `k` equals 3000000000, `k` is updated to be the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the character right after the first space. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a`, `k` is updated to be the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the character right after the first space. If `k` is less than the sum of all elements in `a`, `a` is modified such that the second last element has been decremented by 1 for each iteration, `n` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space, `k` is at least 5 and is now even, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 3, `g` is 3, `a[g]` is decremented by 1, and the loop continues until both `a[d]` and `a[g]` reach 0.**
