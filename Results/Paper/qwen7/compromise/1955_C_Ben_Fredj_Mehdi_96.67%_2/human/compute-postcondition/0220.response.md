Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 2`, `k` must be `k // 2` or greater, `a[d]` is decreased by 1, `d` is decreased by 1, and `g` is increased by 1 if `a[g]` is not zero.**

Explanation: The code `d -= 1` decrements the value of `d` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
