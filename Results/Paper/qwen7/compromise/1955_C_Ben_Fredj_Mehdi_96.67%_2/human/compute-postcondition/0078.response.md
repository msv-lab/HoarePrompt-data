Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `z` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers split from the input string.
- `n` is the first element of `a` and is explicitly stated to be 20.
- `k` is the second element of `a` and is explicitly stated to be 1000000000.
- There are multiple conditions stating that `k` is not equal to certain large numbers, but these do not affect the value of `k` which is already given as 1000000000.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('10')
```

This will directly print the string '10'.

Output: **10**
