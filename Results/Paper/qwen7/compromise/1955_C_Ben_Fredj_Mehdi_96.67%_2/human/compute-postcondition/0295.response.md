Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space, `k` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting right after the first space, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, `g` is 0.**

The code initializes `g` to 0, which does not affect the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, `k`, or `d`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
