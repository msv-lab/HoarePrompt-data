Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `z` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers split from an input string.
- `n` is the first element of `a`.
- `k` is the second element of `a`.
- `k` is equal to 9999999999.

The condition `(n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and (a[0] == 1))` is still false, meaning that `n` is not 1, or `k` is not 10000000000000, or `a[0]` is not 1.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('9')
```

This will directly print the string `'9'`.

Output: **9**
