Output State: **`t` is reduced to an input integer, and no other variables are defined or changed.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes the initial value of `t`, which is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), and assigns it to `t` as an integer. No other variables are defined or changed in this process. Therefore, the only change is that `t` is now explicitly set to the input integer value.
