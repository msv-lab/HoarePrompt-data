Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space, `k` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the character right after the first space. If `k` equals 1999999998, `k` remains unchanged. If `k` equals 1999999999, `k` is updated to be the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the character right after the first space. If `k` equals 99999999999, `k` is updated to be the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the character right after the first space. If `n` equals 1 and `k` equals 10000000000000 and the first element of `a` is 1, then `k` is updated to be the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the character right after the first space. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.
