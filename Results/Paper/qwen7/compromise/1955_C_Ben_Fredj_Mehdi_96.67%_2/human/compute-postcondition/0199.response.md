Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(k // 2)`. Therefore, the variables that need to be considered are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values and Conditions**:
   - `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `k // 2 - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1 (since `k // 2` must be a positive integer).

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `k` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `i` will be 0 when the loop starts.

Given the initial states:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (not needed for the loop execution).
- `z` is 1 (not needed for the loop execution).
- `a` is a list of integers (not needed for the loop execution).
- `n` is the first element of `a` (not needed for the loop execution).
- `k` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting right after the first space (must be at least 1 for the loop to execute).
- `d` is the length of `a` minus 1 (not needed for the loop execution).
- `g` is 0 (not needed for the loop execution).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` must be at least 1.
- `i` will start at 0.

**State:**
**`k` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
