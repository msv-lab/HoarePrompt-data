Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 3`, `k` must be `k // 2` or greater, `g` is increased by 1.**

The code `g += 1` increments the value of `g` by 1. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still `i_prev + 3`, and `k` must still be `k // 2` or greater. The value of `g` is increased by 1.
