Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(k // 2)`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k // 2`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Typically, the loop starts with `i` set to 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < k // 2`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `k // 2` for the loop to run at least once.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (unchanged).
   - `z` is 2 (unchanged).
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces (unchanged).
   - `n` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space (unchanged).
   - `k` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting right after the first space (unchanged).
   - `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 1 (unchanged).
   - `g` is 0 (unchanged).

5. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `k // 2`. Since `i` starts at 0, we need to ensure that `k // 2` is at least 1. This means `k` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `k` must be at least 2.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space, `k` must be at least 2, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, `g` is 0**
