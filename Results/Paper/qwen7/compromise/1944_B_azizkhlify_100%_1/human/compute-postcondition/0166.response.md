Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is set to `2 * n`.
   - `ul` is incremented by 2 (`ul = ul + 2`).
   - The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is `2 * n`.
- `a[i]` refers to the element at index `2 * n` in the list `a`.

However, the value of `a[i]` itself is not explicitly given. We only know that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0, but this does not directly help us determine the value of `a[i]`.

Given the information, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i]` without knowing the contents of the list `a`. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the value of `a[i]`.

Output: **[a[i]], [a[i]]** (where `[a[i]]` is the value of the element at index `2 * n` in the list `a`)
