Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` contains all the elements of the list `a`.
- `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- The current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

From the information given:
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is also greater than or equal to 1.
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is currently 2, which means that the element `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` has the value 2.

However, the value of `a[i]` itself is not explicitly given. We only know that `a[i]` is an element of the list `a` and that `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2. But since we need to print `a[i]`, and there's no further information about the specific value of `a[i]`, we can only say that `a[i]` is some element of the list `a`.

Given this, the output will be the value of `a[i]` printed twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **[a[i]] [a[i]]**
