Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `2 * n`, `ul` is `ul + 4`, and the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables before the `break` statement remain unchanged.
