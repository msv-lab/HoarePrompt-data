Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- The current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.

The print statement is `print(a[i], end=' ')`.

To determine what will be printed, let's break it down:

1. `a` is a list of integers.
2. `a[i]` refers to an element in the list `a` at index `i`.
3. The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is explicitly stated to be 1.

Given that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, it implies that `a[i] - 1` is the index in list `l` where the value is 1. Therefore, `a[i]` must be the index in list `a` that corresponds to the position in list `l` where the value is 1.

Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not specified, we know that `a[i]` is the index in `a` such that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1. However, the print statement only outputs `a[i]`, not the value of `l[a[i] - 1]`.

Thus, the output will be the value of `a[i]`.

Output: **a[i]**
