Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is unchanged, `2 * n` is unchanged, `ur` is `ur + 2`, `ul` equals `ur`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` was being checked. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variable values, only the fact that the loop or conditional block is exited is noted. All other variables retain their initial or unchanged states.
