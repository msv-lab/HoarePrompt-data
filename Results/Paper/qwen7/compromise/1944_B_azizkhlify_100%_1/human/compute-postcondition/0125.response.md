Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is unchanged, `2 * n` is unchanged, `ur` is either `ur + 2` or `ur + 4`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the value of `i` remains `n + 2`, `n` and `2 * n` remain unchanged, `ur` is either `ur + 2` or `ur + 4`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
