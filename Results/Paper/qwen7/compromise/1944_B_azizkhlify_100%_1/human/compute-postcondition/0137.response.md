Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from input, `k` is an integer value obtained from input, `i` is 2 * `n` + 1, `ur` is 2 * (`n` + 1) - 2 * `k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes three variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` to 0. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `ur`, `a`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
