Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` becomes 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 (as it was before) but now specifically greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

6. **Final state**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented by 1 again in the next iteration, but we don't know its exact value yet.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2**.
