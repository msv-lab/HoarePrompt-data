Output State: **`res` contains all the elements of the list `a`, `ul` is equal to `ur` + 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0.**

Explanation: The code `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `res` still contains all the elements of the list `a`, `ul` is now equal to `ur` + 2, `n` remains greater than or equal to 1, `i` is still equal to `n + 1`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is still set to 0.
