Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from input, `k` is an integer value obtained from input, `i` is 2 * `n` + 1, `ur` is 2 * (`n` + 1) - 2 * `k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, and `r[a[i] - 1]` for each `i` from `n` to 2 * (`n` + 1) - 1 is set to 0.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `ur`, or the assignment of `r[a[i] - 1]` to 0 for each `i` from `n` to `2 * (n + 1) - 1`. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and `ur` remain unchanged, and the list `a` is updated with the new values.
