Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i < 2 * n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n`
   - `n` must be greater than 6
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 (though this is not directly relevant to adjusting the loop head variables)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `n + 1`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 6, it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 6**
