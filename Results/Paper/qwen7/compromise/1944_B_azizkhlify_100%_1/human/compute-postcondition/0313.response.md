Output State: **`i` is `n`, `ul` is `2 * k`, `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 for the last executed `i`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` in each iteration until it reaches `n`. The variable `ul` will be equal to `2 * k` because it increments by 2 in each iteration of the loop, and the loop breaks when `ul` equals `k * 2`. For the last executed `i`, the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` will be 0 because the loop sets `l[a[i] - 1]` to 0 whenever `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2. All other variables' states remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
