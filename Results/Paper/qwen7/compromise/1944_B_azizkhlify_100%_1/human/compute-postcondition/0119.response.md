Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n, 2 * n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `[n, 2 * n)`. This means `i` should be less than `2 * n` and greater than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is unchanged.
   - `2 * n` is unchanged.
   - `ur` is `ur + 2`.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0.
   - If `ul` equals `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` was `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `n + 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `2 * n` remains unchanged.
   - `ur` increases by 2, so it becomes `ur + 4`.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is still 0 because the value of `a[i]` does not change within the loop.
   - The condition `if ul == ur` needs to be checked again with the new value of `ur`.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `i` will be `n + 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `2 * n` remains unchanged.
   - `ur` will be `ur + 4`.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` remains 0.
   - The condition `if ul == ur` will be checked with the updated `ur`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is unchanged, `2 * n` is unchanged, `ur` is `ur + 4`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and if `ul` equals `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
