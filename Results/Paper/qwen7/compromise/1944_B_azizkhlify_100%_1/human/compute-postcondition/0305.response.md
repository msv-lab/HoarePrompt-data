Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1`
- `ul` is `ul + 2`
- `n` must be the same as at the end of the previous iteration

We need to determine the values of `a[i]` and `a[i]` that will be printed. Since the initial state does not provide any explicit values for `a`, `i`, or `ul`, we can only describe the values in terms of their relationships to other variables.

Given that `i` is `i + 1`, it implies that `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value. Similarly, `ul` has been incremented by 2 from its previous value. However, without knowing the initial values of `a`, `i`, or `ul`, we cannot provide specific numerical values for `a[i]`.

Therefore, the output will be a repetition of the value of `a[i]` followed by a space.

Output: **[a[i]] [a[i]]**
