Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of integers where the elements at indices `a[0] - 1`, `a[1] - 1`, ..., `a[i-1] - 1` are equal to 1, and `res` is a list containing the elements of `a` up to index `i-1`. If `re` equals `k`, `res` will contain the elements that caused `re` to reach `k` and the loop will break out.
