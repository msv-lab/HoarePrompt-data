Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 5.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.
   - `l[a[5] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 5, `i < n` implies that `n` must be greater than 5.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 6.
   - `n` must be greater than 5 to allow the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 6, `n` must be greater than 5**.
