Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string, `a` is a list of integers split from the input string, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `r` is a list of `n` zeros.**

The code initializes a new list `r` with `n` zeros. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
