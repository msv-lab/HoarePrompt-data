Postcondition: **The variable `res` still contains all the elements of the list `a`. The variable `ul` is equal to `ur` plus twice the number of iterations the loop has executed. The variable `i` is equal to `n` plus the total number of iterations the loop has executed. The variable `n` remains unchanged and must be greater than or equal to 1. If `ul` equals `ur` at any point during the loop, the loop breaks early.**
