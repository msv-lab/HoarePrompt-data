Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is unchanged, `2 * n` is unchanged, the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r`. Given that the initial value of `r[a[i] - 1]` was `2`, after executing this line, the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` changes to `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.
