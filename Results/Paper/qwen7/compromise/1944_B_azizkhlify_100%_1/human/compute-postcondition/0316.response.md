Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `ul` (which stands for upper limit) is 0.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 for the last executed `i`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being equal to `n`, the loop will only execute if `n` is at least 1.
   - The variable `ul` is not directly involved in the loop condition or the loop body, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` for the last executed `i` is not relevant to the loop starting condition but might affect subsequent iterations.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**
