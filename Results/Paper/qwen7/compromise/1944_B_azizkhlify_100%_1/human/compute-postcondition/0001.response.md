Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string**.

Explanation: The code splits the input string into two integers and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
