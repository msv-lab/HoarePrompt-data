Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `ul` is `ul` plus 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `i` and `ul` are updated according to the initial conditions before the `break` statement was encountered. No further changes are made to the variables.
