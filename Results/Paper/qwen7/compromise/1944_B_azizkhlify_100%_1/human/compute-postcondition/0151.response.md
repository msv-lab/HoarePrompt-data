Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i < 2 * n`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since the loop starts at `i = n` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n + 1`.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `2 * n`. Given that `i` is currently `n + 1`, the loop will continue as long as `n + 1 < 2 * n`, which simplifies to `n > 1`.

6. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop continues, `i` will be incremented to `n + 2` at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is `n + 2`**
