Based on the initial state provided, there are no variables or objects defined other than the `print` statement itself. The `print(i, end=' ')` statement indicates that the value of the variable `i` will be printed followed by a space (`end=' '`).

Since the value of `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, the output will be the value of `i` followed by a space.

Output: **[value of i] **
