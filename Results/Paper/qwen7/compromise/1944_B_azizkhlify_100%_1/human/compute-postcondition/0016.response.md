Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is unchanged, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` by 1. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The exact value of `r[a[i] - 1]` depends on the current values of `i` and `a`, but it is clear that this value has been incremented by 1.
