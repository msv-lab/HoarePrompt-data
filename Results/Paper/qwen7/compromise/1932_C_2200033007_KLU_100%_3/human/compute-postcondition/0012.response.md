Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^4]), and `s` (a string consisting of `n` characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a list of integers where each integer is the product of all elements in a reversed list `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`.**

This means the function processes a list `a`, reverses it, calculates the product of its elements modulo `m`, and then returns a new list where each element is this calculated product. The process involves reversing the original list `a`, computing the product of its elements, taking the result modulo `m`, and then reversing the list again to form the final output list.
