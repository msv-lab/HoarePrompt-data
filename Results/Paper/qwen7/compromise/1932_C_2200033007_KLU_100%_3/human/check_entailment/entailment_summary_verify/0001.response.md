### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` step-by-step to ensure its correctness according to the problem description.

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The program should process each command in the string `s` and output the remainder of the product of the remaining elements of the array `a` modulo `m`.
   - If the command is 'L', the leftmost element is removed.
   - If the command is 'R', the rightmost element is removed.
   - After processing all commands, the array `a` should be empty.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the direction specified in `s`.
   - However, there is a critical issue in how the function processes the commands. Instead of removing elements from `a` and updating the pointers `l` and `r`, it simply appends elements to `b` based on the direction specified in `s`. This means that the function does not actually modify the array `a` as required by the problem description.

3. **Key Issues**:
   - The function `func_1` does not update the array `a` as it processes the commands. Therefore, the product calculation is incorrect because it uses the same array `a` without removing elements.
   - The function constructs the list `b` but does not use it to calculate the required remainders. Instead, it calculates the product of the elements in `b` directly, which is not what the problem requires.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly implement the solution, the function should:
     - Remove elements from `a` based on the commands in `s`.
     - Calculate the product of the remaining elements in `a` modulo `m` after each command.
     - Store the results in a list and return them in the correct order.

Given these points, the original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The function does not remove elements from `a` and instead constructs a new list `b` which is not used correctly.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly remove elements from the array `a` as specified in the problem description.
