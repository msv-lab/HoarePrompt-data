### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description:
- For each command, the program should output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m`.
- After processing each command, the corresponding element is removed from the array `a`.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the direction specified in `s`.
- It then calculates the product of all elements in `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m` and returns a list of these products, with the list itself reversed.

#### Program Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
   a = list(map(int, input().split()))
   s = input()
   ```
   This part reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.

2. **Constructing List `b`**:
   ```python
   def func_1(n, m, a, s):
       b = []
       l = 0
       r = n - 1
       for i in range(n):
           if s[i] == 'L':
               b.append(a[l])
               l += 1
           else:
               b.append(a[r])
               r -= 1
   ```
   Here, the function `func_1` constructs a list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the direction specified in `s`. However, this construction is not aligned with the problem description, which requires the program to output the product at the start of each command execution.

3. **Calculating the Product**:
   ```python
   ans = []
   p = 1
   for v in reversed(b):
       p = p * v % m
       ans.append(p)
   return reversed(ans)
   ```
   The function then calculates the product of all elements in `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m` and returns a list of these products, with the list itself reversed. This step is also not aligned with the problem description, as it does not compute the product at the start of each command execution.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the required logic. Specifically, it does not output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m` at the beginning of the execution of the i-th command. Instead, it constructs a list `b` and calculates the product in reverse order, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
