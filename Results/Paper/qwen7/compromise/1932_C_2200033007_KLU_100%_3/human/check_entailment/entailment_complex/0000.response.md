Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly initializes variables `b`, `l`, and `r` to store the result, left index, and right index respectively.
   - It iterates over the string `s` and appends elements from `a` to `b` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'. However, there is a logical error here. The purpose of this loop seems to be misunderstood. The goal should be to compute the product of the remaining elements after each command, not to simply append elements to `b`.

2. **Product Calculation**:
   - The product calculation part of the function is correct. It reverses the list `b`, iterates through it, and calculates the product of the elements modulo `m`.
   - The use of `reversed(ans)` at the end of the function is unnecessary since the list `ans` is already calculated in the correct order.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The function should return the list `ans` directly without reversing it again. The reversed product values are already computed in the correct order.

Given the above analysis, the function is not correctly implementing the logic required by the problem statement. Specifically, it is not correctly handling the removal of elements from `a` based on the commands in `s` and calculating the product of the remaining elements after each command.

Correctness: **False**
