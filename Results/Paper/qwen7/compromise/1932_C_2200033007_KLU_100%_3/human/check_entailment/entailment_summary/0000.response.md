Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input parameters `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`.
2. The function `func_1` constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the direction specified in `s`. This part of the logic matches the problem description.
3. After constructing `b`, the program calculates the product of all elements in `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m` and appends the result to the list `ans`. This also matches the problem description.
4. However, there is a logical error in how the elements are appended to `b`. The original problem requires removing elements from `a` based on the command ('L' or 'R'), but the current implementation does not actually modify `a` or remove elements; instead, it appends elements to `b` without removing them from `a`.

Given this analysis, the program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements because it does not remove elements from `a` as specified. Instead, it constructs a new list `b` which is not used in the final product calculation.

Correctness: **False**
