Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly compute the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m` before removing an element based on the command. Instead, it appends the elements from the array `a` to the list `b` based on the command direction ('L' or 'R'), which is the reverse of what the problem description requires. According to the problem description, the program should output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m` at the beginning of the execution of the i-th command, but the current implementation computes the product in reverse order and appends elements to `b` based on the command direction, not computing the product at the start of each command execution.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

The expected output should be:

```
0 2 4 1
```

However, the program's output would be incorrect because it does not compute the product at the start of each command execution.
