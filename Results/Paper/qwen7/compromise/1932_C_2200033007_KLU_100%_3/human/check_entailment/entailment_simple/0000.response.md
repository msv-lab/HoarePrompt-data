Reasoning:
1. The program correctly processes the commands in the string `s` and outputs the required remainders at each step.
2. The function `func_1` initializes an empty list `b` and uses two pointers `l` and `r` to traverse the array `a` based on the commands in `s`.
3. For each command, it appends the appropriate element from `a` to `b` and updates the pointers accordingly.
4. After constructing `b`, it calculates the product of its elements modulo `m` in reverse order and appends these results to `ans`.
5. Finally, it returns the reversed list `ans`.

However, there is a logical error in the implementation:
- The function `func_1` should compute the product of the remaining elements of `a` after each command, not the elements of `b`.
- The current implementation constructs `b` but does not use it to compute the required remainders. Instead, it computes the product of the elements of `b` in reverse order, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the function should directly compute the product of the elements of `a` after each command and append the result to `ans`.

Correctness: **False**

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    ans = []
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        product = (product * a[i]) % m
        ans.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            a.pop()
    
    return ans
```

This corrected function correctly computes the product of the remaining elements of `a` after each command and appends the result to `ans`.
