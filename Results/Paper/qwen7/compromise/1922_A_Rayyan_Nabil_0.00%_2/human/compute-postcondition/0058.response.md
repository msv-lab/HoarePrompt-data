Output State: **`i` is `n`, `t` is `n-2`, `l` is 'YES', `b` is an input from the user, `c` is an input from the user**

Explanation: The line `l = 'YES'` does not change the values of any other variables. It only reassigns the variable `l` to the string `'YES'`, which was its initial value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
