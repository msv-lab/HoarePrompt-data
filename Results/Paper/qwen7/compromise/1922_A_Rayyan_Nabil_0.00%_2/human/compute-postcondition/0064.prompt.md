Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `l` is 'YES', `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            l = 'YES'
    else:
        l = 'NO'
    print(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed (which is the same as the value of `n` provided initially), `i` is `n-1`, and `l` is 'YES' if for every index `j` from 0 to `n-1`, both `a[j]` is not equal to `c[j]` and `b[j]` is not equal to `c[j]`. If there exists any index `j` where either `a[j]` equals `c[j]` or `b[j]` equals `c[j]`, then `l` remains 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is `n-1`, `l` is 'NO', `c` is the input from the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is `n`, `t` is `n-2`, `l` is 'YES', `b` is an input from the user, `c` is an input from the user.

This output state indicates that after all iterations of the loop have been executed, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, as the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `t` remains `n-2` because it is not modified within the loop. The variable `l` is set to 'YES' if any element in the array satisfies the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` during the loop's execution. Since the loop does not change `l` once it is set to 'YES', `l` will remain 'YES' if the condition was met at least once. The variables `b` and `c` remain unchanged as they are inputs and not modified by the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
