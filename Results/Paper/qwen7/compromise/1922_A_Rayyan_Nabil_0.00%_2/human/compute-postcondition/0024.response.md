Output State: **`i` is `n`, `t` is `n-1`, and `l` is 'YES' if for every index `j` from 0 to `n-1`, both `a[j]` is not equal to `c[j]` and `b[j]` is not equal to `c[j]'. If there exists any index `j` where either `a[j]` equals `c[j]` or `b[j]` equals `c[j]`, then `l` remains 'NO'. An integer `n` is read from input.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` from input. This value is assigned to the variable `n`, replacing whatever value `n` might have had previously. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `i`, `t`, `l`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, these variables remain as described in their initial state. The condition for `l` is unchanged by this input operation.
