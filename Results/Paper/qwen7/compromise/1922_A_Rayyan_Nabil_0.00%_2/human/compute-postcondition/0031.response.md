Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is `n-1`, `l` is 'YES', and `c` is the input from the user. If the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then the postcondition remains as the precondition. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition.
