Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n`, where `n` is a positive integer.
- `t` is `n-1`.
- `l` is 'NO'.
- `c` is the input from the user, but this variable is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is simply printing the value of `l`, which is explicitly given as 'NO'.

Output: **'NO'**
