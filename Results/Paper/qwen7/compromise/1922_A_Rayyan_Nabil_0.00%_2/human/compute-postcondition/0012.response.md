Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The postcondition for the loop body is that if `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then `l` is set to 'YES'. Otherwise, no change is made to `l`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - Since `n` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue, `n` should still satisfy this condition.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented from 0 to 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**.
