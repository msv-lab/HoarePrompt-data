Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `y` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is None, `visited` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to False, `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `visited` is now `[False] * n`**.

This means that the `visited` list has been updated to a boolean list of length `n`, where every element is `False`. All other lists (`x`, `y`, `r`, `coef`) remain unchanged with their initial states.
