Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `visited` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to False, `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element is None, `tot` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `tot` to 0. This is the only change made to the variables. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
