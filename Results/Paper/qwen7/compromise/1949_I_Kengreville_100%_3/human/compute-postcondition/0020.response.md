Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but works with global variables n, x, y, r, visited, and coef, where n is an integer between 1 and 1000, x, y, and r are lists of length n with specific constraints on their elements, and visited and coef are boolean and None lists of length n respectively. The function does not return anything but modifies the global variables visited and coef based on certain conditions.**
