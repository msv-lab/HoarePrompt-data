Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `y` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `r` is a list of length `n`, `visited` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to False, `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to None**

Explanation: The code initializes `y` as a list of length `n` filled with `None`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
