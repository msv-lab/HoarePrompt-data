You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        x = 0
        
        y = 100000000
        
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        
        print(x - y)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` is equal to `t`, `l` is the length of the `nums` list, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is the maximum value found in the `nums` list during the loop's execution, and `y` is the minimum value found in the `nums` list during the loop's execution.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `e` will be equal to `t` because the loop runs `t` times. The variable `l` will remain unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The variable `x` will hold the maximum value found in the `nums` list across all the lists processed by the loop. Similarly, the variable `y` will hold the minimum value found in the `nums` list across all the lists processed by the loop. The other variables (`t` and `nums`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 500) and a list of \( n \) integers (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 100). For each test case, it finds the maximum and minimum values in the list of integers, calculates the difference between these two values, and prints the result. After processing all test cases, it outputs the differences for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\) defined as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

To maximize this sum, we should arrange the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by placing the largest element at one end and the smallest element at the other end, with the remaining elements in between in any order.

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to find the maximum and minimum values in the array and then calculates their difference. However, this approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array as defined.

#### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Approach**: The program only finds the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) values in the array and prints `x - y`. This does not guarantee the maximum possible beauty.
2. **Lack of Rearrangement Logic**: The program does not attempt to rearrange the elements to achieve the maximum beauty.

### Example Analysis
Let's consider the example provided:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `[2, 1, 3]`
   - Maximum and Minimum: `max = 3`, `min = 1`
   - Output: `3 - 1 = 2` (Correct)
   
2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Maximum and Minimum: `max = 69`, `min = 69`
   - Output: `69 - 69 = 0` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
   - Maximum and Minimum: `max = 100`, `min = 43`
   - Output: `100 - 43 = 57` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `[3, 4, 3, 3]`
   - Maximum and Minimum: `max = 4`, `min = 3`
   - Output: `4 - 3 = 1` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `[2, 1]`
   - Maximum and Minimum: `max = 2`, `min = 1`
   - Output: `2 - 1 = 1` (Correct)

### Conclusion
While the program produces the correct output for the given examples, it does not solve the problem correctly because it does not account for the possibility of rearranging the array to maximize the beauty. The program simply finds the maximum and minimum values and calculates their difference, which is not always the optimal solution.
