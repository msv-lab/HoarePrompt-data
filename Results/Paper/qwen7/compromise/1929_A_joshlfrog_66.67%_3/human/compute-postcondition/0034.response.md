Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is the maximum value found in the `nums` list, and `y` is the minimum value found in the `nums` list.**

Explanation: The code `l = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `l`. The other variables (`t`, `e`, `nums`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
