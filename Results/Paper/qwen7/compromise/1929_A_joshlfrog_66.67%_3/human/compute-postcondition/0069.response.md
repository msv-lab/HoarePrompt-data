Output State: **`i` is `l-1`, `x` is 0, `y` is 100000000, `e` is `t`, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers created from user input.**

The given code does not change the values of any variables. It only reassigns the value of `y` to `100000000`, which was its initial value. Therefore, all other variables remain unchanged.
