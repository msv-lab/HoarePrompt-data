Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
- `e` is 0.
- `l` is the length of the `nums` list.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.
- `x` is the maximum value found in the `nums` list.
- `y` is the minimum value found in the `nums` list.

The print statement is `print(x - y)`, which calculates the difference between the maximum value (`x`) and the minimum value (`y`) found in the `nums` list.

Since the exact values of `nums` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `x - y`. However, we know that `x` is the maximum value in `nums` and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.

Therefore, the output will be the difference between the maximum and minimum values found in the `nums` list.

Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value and y is the minimum value found in the `nums` list)**
