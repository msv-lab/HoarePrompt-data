Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `i` is 1, and if the element at index 1 of `nums` is greater than `x`, then no change is made to `nums`; otherwise, the element at index 1 of `nums` remains unchanged.
