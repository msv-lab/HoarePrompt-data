Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `y` is equal to `nums[i]`, and `x` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `y = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `y`. The values of `t`, `e`, `l`, `nums`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
