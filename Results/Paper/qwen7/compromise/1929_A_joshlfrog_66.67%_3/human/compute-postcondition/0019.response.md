Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces. If `nums[i] > x`, then `x` is now equal to `nums[i]` and `y` remains unchanged. If `nums[i] <= x`, then `x` remains unchanged and `y` remains unchanged.
