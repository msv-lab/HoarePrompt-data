Postcondition: `i` is an index such that `i` must be less than `l`, `x` is now equal to `y`, `y` remains 100000000, `e` is `t`, `l` is an input integer, and `nums` is a list of integers created from user input. If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, `x` is set to `nums[i]`; otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.
