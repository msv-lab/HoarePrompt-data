Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `r` is a string containing each unique character from `encoded` in sorted order; `mapping` is a dictionary where each key is a character from `r` and its corresponding value is the character from `r` at the mirrored index (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second character maps to the second last, and so on).**

Explanation: The code creates a dictionary named `mapping` where each character from the string `r` (which contains all unique characters from `encoded` in sorted order) is mapped to its mirrored character in `r`. For example, if `r` is "abcde", then `mapping` would be {'a': 'e', 'b': 'd', 'c': 'c', 'd': 'b', 'e': 'a'}. The lengths and contents of `encoded` and `r` remain unchanged.
