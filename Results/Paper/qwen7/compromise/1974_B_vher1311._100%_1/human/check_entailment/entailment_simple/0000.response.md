Reasoning:
1. The provided program reads input and processes multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it correctly extracts the length `n` and the encoded string `b`.
3. The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string `b` back to the original string `s`.
4. The function `func_1` first creates the string `r` by sorting and removing duplicates from the encoded string `b`.
5. It then creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding mirrored character from the end of `r`.
6. Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`.

Given the problem description and the steps taken in the function `func_1`, the program appears to correctly implement the decoding logic as required.

Correctness: **True**
