You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    b = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(b))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join((mapping[char] for char in encoded))



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string where each character in `encoded` is replaced by its mirrored counterpart based on a predefined mapping.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded strings according to the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through the list to process each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts the length `n` of the encoded string `b`.
   - It then processes the encoded string `b` to decode it.

3. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - **Creating the Auxiliary String `r`:**
     - `r` is created by taking the sorted unique characters from the encoded string `b`.
     - This part is correct as it ensures `r` contains all distinct characters in sorted order.
   - **Mapping Characters:**
     - A dictionary `mapping` is created where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character in `r`.
     - This is done by iterating through `r` and creating the mapping such that the first character maps to the last, the second to the second from the end, and so on.
     - This part is also correct as it correctly sets up the symmetric mapping.
   - **Decoding the Encoded String:**
     - The encoded string `b` is decoded by replacing each character with its corresponding symmetric character from the mapping.
     - This part is correct as it follows the specified decoding logic.

4. **Output:**
   - The decoded string for each test case is collected in the `results` list and printed at the end.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes each test case, and produces the correct decoded strings.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
