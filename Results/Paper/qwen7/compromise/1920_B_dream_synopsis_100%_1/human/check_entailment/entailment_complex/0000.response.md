Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the list of integers `a`. This matches the problem description.

2. **Sorting and Reversing**: The list `a` is sorted in descending order, which is a good approach because it allows Alice to remove the smallest elements first, and Bob to flip the largest remaining negative elements.

3. **Sum Calculation**: The initial sum of the array (`sum1`) is calculated correctly.

4. **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates from `0` to `k`, and for each iteration:
   - If `i == 0`, it calculates the sum of the array minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements.
   - For other values of `i`, it updates the sum by adding the previous element and subtracting twice the next element in the sorted list.
   - It appends the updated sum to the list `ans`.

5. **Final Output**: The function prints the maximum value in the list `ans`, which represents the optimal sum after both players make their moves.

6. **Edge Cases**: The logic handles edge cases such as when `i + x - 1 >= n`, ensuring that the sum is adjusted correctly without going out of bounds.

Given the above analysis, the function correctly implements the logic to find the optimal sum after both players make their moves according to the rules specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
