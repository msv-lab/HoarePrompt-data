Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `sums` is `sums + a[0]`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[0]`**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `sums` is already defined as `sums + a[0]`, so `ans` will now contain this value in a list. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
