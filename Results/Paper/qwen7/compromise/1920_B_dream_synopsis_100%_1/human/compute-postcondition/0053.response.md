Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is `k + 1`, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `ans` will contain `k + 2` elements, each being the value of `sums` after each iteration from 0 to `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `sum1`. The other variables (`a`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
