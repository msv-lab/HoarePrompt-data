Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 0, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `x` is not specified, we keep it as part of the expression. The other variables remain unchanged.
