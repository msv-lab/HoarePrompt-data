Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, and `sums` is equal to `a[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is initially equal to `a[0]`, `ans` now contains the first element of `a`. All other variables retain their initial states.
