Postcondition: `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 3, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `ans` is a list containing an additional element `sums`. If `i == 0`, then `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is `sum1 + a[2] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is `sum1 + a[2]`.
