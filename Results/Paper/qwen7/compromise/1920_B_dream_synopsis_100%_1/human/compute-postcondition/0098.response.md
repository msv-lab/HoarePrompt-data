Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**.

The code `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. Since the input values are not specified in the initial state, the output state simply states that `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values of the input integers.
