Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` contains `[sums + a[0], sums]`**

Explanation: The code appends `sums` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains `[sums + a[0]]`. After appending `sums`, `ans` becomes `[sums + a[0], sums]`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
