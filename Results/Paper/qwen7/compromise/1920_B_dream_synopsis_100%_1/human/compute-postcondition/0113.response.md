Output State: **`sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the `sums` variable by adding `a[i - 1]` to its current value. Given that `i` is 0, `i - 1` would be -1, which means `a[i - 1]` refers to the element at index -1 of the list `a`. However, since the initial state does not specify the contents of `a`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a[i - 1]`. Therefore, we express `sums` as `sums + a[i - 1]`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
