Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variables here are:
   - The number of iterations, which is determined by `int(input())`.
   - The loop counter `_` (which is typically an underscore to indicate it's not used).

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop counter `_` is not used in the loop body, it does not change inside the loop. Therefore, it remains `0` at the start of each iteration.
   - The number of iterations is determined by the input, which is read at the beginning of the loop. This means that the input value itself does not change during the loop execution.

3. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` will be `k` (where `k` is the number of iterations completed so far).
   - `k` remains a non-negative integer.
   - `sums` will be updated based on the conditions within the loop.
   - `ans` will contain `k + 1` elements, each being the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time:
   - The input value (which determines the number of iterations) remains the same.
   - The loop counter `_` starts at `0` for the new iteration.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 after the first iteration of the new loop, making it `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the loop will execute one more time, and `i` will be `k + 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `k` remains a non-negative integer, `sums` will be updated based on the conditions within the loop, and `ans` will contain `k + 2` elements, each being the value of `sums` after each iteration from 0 to `k + 1`.**
