Postcondition: `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `ans` is a list. If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `ans` contains one element which is `sums`, where `sums` is `a[0] - 2 * a[x]`. Otherwise, `ans` contains the value of `sums`, where `sums` is equal to `a[0]`.
