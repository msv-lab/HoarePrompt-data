Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `sums` is `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[1 + x - 1]`, `ans` contains `[sums + a[1] - 2 * a[1 + x - 1]]**.

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `a`, `x`, or `sums`, the expression `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[1 + x - 1]` remains as it is. The variables `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and `ans` now contains the calculated value of `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[1 + x - 1]` as its first element.
