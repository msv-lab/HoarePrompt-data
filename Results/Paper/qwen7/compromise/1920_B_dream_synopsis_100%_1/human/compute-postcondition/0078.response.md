Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing either `sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` if `i` is 0, or `sums = a[0] - 2 * a[x]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums = a[0]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`, and `sums` is `sum1 + a[0]; ans` now contains one additional element which is `sums`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since the value of `sums` is defined based on the conditions involving `i` and `x`, and these conditions haven't changed, `sums` remains as per its definition. The list `ans` now includes one more element, which is the calculated `sums`. All other variables (`a`, `i`, `sum1`) remain unchanged in their respective states.
