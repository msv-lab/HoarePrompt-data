Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `k`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`.
   - `ans` is a list containing an additional element based on the conditions provided.

3. **Loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `range(k + 1)`. This means `i` will take values from 0 to `k`.

4. **Adjusting the state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Conditions to check**:
   - If `i == 0`, `ans` is updated to contain `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
   - If `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` is further updated to contain `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
   - Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 >= n`, `ans` is updated to contain `sum1 + a[0]`.

Since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `i` and `k`.

6. **New state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `k` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 3, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `ans` is a list containing an additional element based on the conditions provided.**
