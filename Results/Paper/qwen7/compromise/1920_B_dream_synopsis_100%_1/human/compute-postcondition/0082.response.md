Postcondition: `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `ans` is a list containing an additional element based on the conditions provided. Specifically, if `i == 0`, `ans` is updated to contain `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` is further updated to contain `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 >= n`, `ans` is updated to contain `sum1 + a[0]`.
