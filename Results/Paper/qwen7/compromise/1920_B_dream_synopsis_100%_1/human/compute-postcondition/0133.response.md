Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` contains `[sums]`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, it remains unchanged after appending to `ans`. The variables `i` and `k` are not affected by this operation.
