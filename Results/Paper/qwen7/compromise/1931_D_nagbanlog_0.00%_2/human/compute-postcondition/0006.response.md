Based on the initial state provided:

- `beautiful_count` is 0.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `test_cases` is a non-empty list.
- `n` is the first element of the first sublist in `test_cases` under 'params'.
- `x` is the second element of the same sublist.
- `y` is the third element of the same sublist.
- `a` is the 'array' from the first test case.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
```

Here's the breakdown of the values being printed:
- `n` is the first element of the first sublist in `test_cases` under 'params'.
- `x` is the second element of the same sublist.
- `y` is the third element of the same sublist.
- `a` is the 'array' from the first test case.

Since the exact values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` are not provided, they will be represented as placeholders in the output.

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]**
