Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [num % x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [(x - num % x) % x], required_mod_y: [mod_y]** 

Explanation:
- `num` is the next element in the list `a`.
- `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`.
- `mod_y` remains unchanged from its previous value.
- `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` remains unchanged from its previous value.
- The print statement formats and prints these values.
