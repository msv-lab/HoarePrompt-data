Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `n` is the first element of the first sublist in `test_cases` under 'params', `x` is the second element of the same sublist, `y` is the third element of the same sublist.**

Explanation: The code assigns the values from the first element of `test_cases` under the key `'params'` to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The `results` list remains unchanged, and `test_cases` remains as a non-empty list. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are now specific elements from the first test case in `test_cases`.
