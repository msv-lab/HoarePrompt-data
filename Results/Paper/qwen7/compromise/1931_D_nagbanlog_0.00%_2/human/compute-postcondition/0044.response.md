Postcondition: `a` is not empty, `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged. `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is equal to `num % x`, `mod_y` is equal to `mod_y` (now updated), `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y` (now updated).
