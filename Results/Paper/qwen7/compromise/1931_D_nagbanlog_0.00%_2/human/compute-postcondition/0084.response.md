Postcondition: `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary; otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged. `case['params']`, `results`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_y` retain their original values.
