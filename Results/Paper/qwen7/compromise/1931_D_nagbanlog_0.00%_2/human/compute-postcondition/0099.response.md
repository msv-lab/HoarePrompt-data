Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `case['params']` retains its original value, `results` retains its original value, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 1, `mod_x` is updated to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, and `required_mod_y` is updated to `mod_y`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` by 1. This means that if the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` exists in the dictionary `freq`, the value of `beautiful_count` is incremented by the current value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]`. If the key does not exist, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged. The values of `case['params']` and `results` remain the same. The dictionary `freq` now has the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` with a value of 1. Additionally, `mod_x` is updated to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, and `required_mod_y` is updated to `mod_y`.
