Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `case` is the next dictionary in `test_cases` containing `params`, `results`, `beautiful_count`, etc.; `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, and `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`; `a` is assigned the value of `case['array']`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `mod_x` which is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`. The value of `num` is the first element of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
