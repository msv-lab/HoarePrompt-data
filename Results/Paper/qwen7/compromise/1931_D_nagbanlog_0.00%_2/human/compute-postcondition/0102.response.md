Output State: **`beautiful_count` contains the total count of numbers from `a` that satisfy the condition `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` existing in `freq`; `case['params']` remains as a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`; `results` now includes the value of `beautiful_count`; `freq` is a dictionary that keeps track of the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair; `a` is the array from which numbers are iterated over, and `test_cases` remains unchanged.**

The code `results.append(beautiful_count)` appends the current value of `beautiful_count` to the list `results`. Since `beautiful_count` was already defined and contains the total count of numbers from `a` that satisfy the condition `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` existing in `freq`, it is added to `results`. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.
