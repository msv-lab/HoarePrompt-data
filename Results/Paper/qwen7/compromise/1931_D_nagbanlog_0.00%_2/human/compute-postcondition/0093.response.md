Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `case['params']` retains its original value, `results` retains its original value, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 1, `mod_x` is updated to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is updated to `mod_y`.**

Explanation:
- `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the dictionary `freq`.
- If the key does not exist, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.
- The value of `case['params']` and `results` remain the same as their original values.
- The dictionary `freq` is updated such that `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 1.
- `mod_x` is updated to `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`.
- `required_mod_y` is updated to `mod_y`.
