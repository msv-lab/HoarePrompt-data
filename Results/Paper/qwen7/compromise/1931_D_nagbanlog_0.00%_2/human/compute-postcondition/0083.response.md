Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged; `case['params']` retains its original value; `results` retains its original value; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 0; `mod_x` retains its original value; `mod_y` retains its original value; `required_mod_y` retains its original value.**

Explanation: The code sets `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` to 0, which does not affect `beautiful_count` unless the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` was previously in the `freq` dictionary and would have caused `beautiful_count` to be incremented. The other variables retain their original values from the initial state.
