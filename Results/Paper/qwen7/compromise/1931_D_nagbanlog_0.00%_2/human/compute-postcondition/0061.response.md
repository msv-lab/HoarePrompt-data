Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `case['params']` is a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`, `results` is a list containing the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `a` must have at least one element, and `test_cases` still contains at least one element; `mod_x` is calculated as `num % x`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `mod_x` as `num % x`, which means the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`. However, since no specific value for `num` is given, `mod_x` remains an expression rather than a specific value. All other variables retain their initial states.
