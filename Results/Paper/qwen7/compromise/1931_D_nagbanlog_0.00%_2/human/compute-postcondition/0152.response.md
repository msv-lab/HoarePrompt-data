Output State: `results` is a list containing the total count of beautiful pairs for all test cases processed. For each test case, `beautiful_count` is calculated based on the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs in the `freq` dictionary, and then appended to `results`. The `freq` dictionary is updated during each iteration of the inner loop for each test case. The `test_cases` variable remains unchanged, and `a` is the array from which numbers are iterated over for each test case. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` for each test case are used to compute the beautiful pairs count, and `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are no longer defined after each iteration.

In summary, `results` will contain the total count of beautiful pairs across all test cases after the loop has executed all its iterations.
