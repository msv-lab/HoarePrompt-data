Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `case['params']` retains its original value, `results` retains its original value, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 0, `mod_x` is updated to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, and `required_mod_y` is updated to `mod_y`.**

Explanation:
- The line `freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0` sets the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` to 0.
- The values of `beautiful_count`, `case['params']`, and `results` remain unchanged from their initial states.
- `mod_x` is updated to `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`.
- `required_mod_y` is updated to `mod_y`.
