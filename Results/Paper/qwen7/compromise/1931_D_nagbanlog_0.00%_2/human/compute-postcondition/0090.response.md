Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `case['params']` retains its original value, `results` retains its original value, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 1, `mod_x` is updated to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, and `required_mod_y` retains its original value.**

This means:
- `beautiful_count` is updated based on the condition given.
- `case['params']` and `results` remain unchanged.
- `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 1.
- `mod_x` is now `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `mod_y` is now `num % y`.
- `required_mod_y` remains unchanged.
