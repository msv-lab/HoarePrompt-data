Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `test_cases`, a list of test cases. Each test case is a list containing three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. Based on these inputs, the function returns a list named `results` containing the total count of beautiful pairs for all test cases. For each test case, the count of beautiful pairs is determined by the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs in a `freq` dictionary, and the results list accumulates these counts for each test case.**
