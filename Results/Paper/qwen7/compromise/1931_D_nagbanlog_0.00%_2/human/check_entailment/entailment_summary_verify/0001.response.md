### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Function Definition and Input Handling
- The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of dictionaries containing test case parameters).
- It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

#### Loop Through Each Test Case
- For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.
- It prints some debug information about the current test case.

#### Frequency Dictionary Initialization
- A dictionary `freq` is initialized to keep track of the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.
- A variable `beautiful_count` is initialized to zero to count the number of beautiful pairs.

#### Iterate Through the Array
- For each element `num` in the array `a`, it calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y` as `num % x` and `num % y`, respectively.
- It then calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x` and `required_mod_y` as `mod_y`.

#### Check Frequency Dictionary
- If the `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` pair is already in the frequency dictionary, it adds the corresponding value to `beautiful_count`.
- If the `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair is not in the frequency dictionary, it initializes it with zero.
- It increments the frequency of the `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.

#### Store Result and Print
- After processing all elements in the array, it appends `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.
- It prints the `beautiful_count` for the current test case.

### Issues Identified

1. **Modulo Calculation for `required_mod_x`**:
   - The calculation of `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x` might not always yield the correct result. For example, if `mod_x` is `0`, `required_mod_x` will be `x`, which is not what we want. Instead, we should directly use `x - mod_x` without the modulo operation, as `x - 0` is `x`.

2. **Debug Information**:
   - The debug information printed inside the loop can be removed or commented out if not needed, but it does not affect the correctness of the logic.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle edge cases where `x` or `y` could be zero, although the problem statement guarantees `1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9`.

### Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, y) = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = x - mod_x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

### Conclusion

After making the necessary corrections, the program should work correctly according to the problem description. The original assessment identified the issue with the modulo calculation for `required_mod_x` and suggested the correct approach. The corrected code addresses this issue and should produce the correct results.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
