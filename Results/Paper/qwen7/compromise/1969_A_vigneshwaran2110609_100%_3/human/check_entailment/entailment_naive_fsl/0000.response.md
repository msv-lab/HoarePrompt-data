Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of invitations needed for at least 2 friends to come to the party. Specifically, the program checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and prints 2 if such a pair is found. However, this approach is insufficient because it does not consider cases where no such direct pair exists but a smaller set of invitations could still result in at least 2 friends coming.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
3 1 2 5 4
```
The program would output `2` because it finds that friends 4 and 5 are each other's best friends. However, the correct solution involves sending invitations to friends 1 and 2, which would also result in at least 2 friends coming to the party. This shows that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
