Output State: **`i` is 100, `x` is greater than 100, `n` is within the range [2, 50], `flag` is True, and `l` is a list of integers entered by the user. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `x`, `n`, `flag`, or `l`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
