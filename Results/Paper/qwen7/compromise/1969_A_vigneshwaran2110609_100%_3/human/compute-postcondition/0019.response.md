Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `flag` is True**.

Explanation: The given code does not affect any of the variables. It only sets the value of `flag` to `True`. Since no other operations are performed on `i`, `x`, or `flag`, their initial states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `flag` and the unchanged values of `i` and `x`.
