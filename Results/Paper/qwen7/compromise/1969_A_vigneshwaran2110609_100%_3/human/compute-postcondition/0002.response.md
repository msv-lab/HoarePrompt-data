Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 50 inclusive, `x` is an input integer.**

The code `x = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `x`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` must be between 2 and 50 inclusive is still valid, but since no direct relation between `n` and the input is specified, the condition on `n` remains as is.
