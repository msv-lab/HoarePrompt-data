Output State: **`i` is 102, `x` is greater than 100, `n` is within the range [2, 50], `flag` is True**

The code simply reassigns the variable `flag` to `True`, which does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged, and `flag` is explicitly set to `True`.
