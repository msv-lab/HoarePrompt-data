Output State: `i` is 50, `x` is greater than 100, `n` is within the range [2, 50], `flag` is True, and `l` is a list of integers entered by the user.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i` = 0 to `i` < `x`. After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `x`. Given that the initial value of `i` is 100 and the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, when the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will reach 50 (since `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 50). The value of `x` will be greater than 100 because it starts from 100 and gets incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The variable `flag` remains True as it is set to True inside the loop when the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` is met, and the loop breaks. The variables `n` and `l` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
