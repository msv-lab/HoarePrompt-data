Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 51
   - `x` must be greater than 51
   - `n` must be within the range [2, 50]
   - `flag` is not mentioned in the current state, so we assume it remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 51 and the loop continues as long as `i < x`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 52.
   - `x` must remain greater than 51, but its exact value is not specified, so we keep it as "must be greater than 51".
   - `n` must still be within the range [2, 50].
   - `flag` is not affected by the loop increment, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 52, `x` must be greater than 51, `n` must be within the range [2, 50]**.
