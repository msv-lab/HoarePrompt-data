Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    x = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    for i in range(0, x):
        if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
            flag = True
            print(2)
            break
    else:
        print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is 49, x is 50, n is within the range [2, 50], l is a list of integers, and flag is either True or False based on the condition l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1 for all i from 0 to 49.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is 99, `x` must be greater than 99, `n` must be within the range [2, 50], `flag` remains False, and the list `l` remains unchanged.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = x-1`. After 99 iterations (since `i` starts at 0), `i` will be 99. For the loop to run 99 times, the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` must not be met for any `i` in the range `[0, 98]`. Therefore, `flag` remains `False`, and no changes are made to the list `l`. The variable `x` must be greater than 99 to allow the loop to complete all 99 iterations. The value of `n` remains within the range [2, 50] as it is not affected by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is 50, `x` is greater than 100, `n` is within the range [2, 50], `flag` is True, and `l` is a list of integers entered by the user.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i` = 0 to `i` < `x`. After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `x`. Given that the initial value of `i` is 100 and the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, when the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will reach 50 (since `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 50). The value of `x` will be greater than 100 because it starts from 100 and gets incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The variable `flag` remains True as it is set to True inside the loop when the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` is met, and the loop breaks. The variables `n` and `l` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
