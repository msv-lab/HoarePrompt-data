Output State: **`ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]` multiplies `ans` by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the expression `a[i] - a[i - 1]` becomes `a[1] - a[0]`. The value of `i` is then incremented to 2. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
