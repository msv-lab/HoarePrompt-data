Let's break down the problem step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `n` is the first integer input split from the input string.
   - `k` is the second integer input split from the input string.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `m` is the minimum value in list `a`.
   - `ans` is the initial value of `ans` (which is `a[0]`) multiplied by the product of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the array `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, unless `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, in which case `ans` remains `math.factorial(n)`.

2. **Determine the Value of `ans`**:
   - We need to check if `k >= n * m`. If true, then `ans = math.factorial(n)`.
   - Otherwise, `ans = a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])`.

Given the nature of the problem, without specific values for `n`, `k`, and the elements of `a`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe it based on the conditions provided.

3. **Output**:
   - If `k < n * m`, then `ans` is the product of the differences between consecutive elements starting from `a[0]`.
   - If `k >= n * m`, then `ans` is `math.factorial(n)`.

Since the exact values are not provided, we describe the output in terms of the conditions:

Output: **ans (where ans is the initial value of `ans` (which is `a[0]`) multiplied by the product of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the array `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, unless `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, in which case `ans` remains `math.factorial(n)`)**
