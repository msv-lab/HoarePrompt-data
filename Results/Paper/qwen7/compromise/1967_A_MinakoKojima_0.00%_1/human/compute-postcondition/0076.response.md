Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is less than `n`
- `n` is the next positive integer input split from the input string
- `k` is decreased by `min(k, m + k // n - a[i + 1])`
- `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i + 1])`

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` is defined as the next positive integer input split from the input string.
   - This value does not change within the loop; it remains the same for all iterations.

3. **Variable `k`:**
   - `k` is updated based on the expression `k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i + 1])`.
   - Since this update happens outside the loop, `k` remains unchanged until the next iteration.

4. **Variable `a[i]`:**
   - `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i + 1])`.
   - This update also happens outside the loop, so `a[i]` remains unchanged until the next iteration.

### Adjusting the States:
- `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1` for the next iteration.
- `n` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same.
- `a[i]` remains the same.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is the next positive integer input split from the input string, `k` is decreased by `min(k, m + k // n - a[i + 1])`, `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i + 1])`, `i` is `i + 1`**

However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, the relevant adjustment is:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the next positive integer input split from the input string, `k` is decreased by `min(k, m + k // n - a[i + 1])`, `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i + 1])`**
