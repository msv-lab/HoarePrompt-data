Output State: **`ans` is equal to `ans * (a[3] - a[2])`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code multiplies `ans` by `a[i] - a[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression `a[i] - a[i - 1]` becomes `a[3] - a[2]`. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `ans * (a[3] - a[2])`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
