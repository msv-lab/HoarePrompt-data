Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - From the given state before the loop starts, `i` is equal to `n-1`.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, so `i` should start from `1`.

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being `n-1`, we need to adjust `i` to be `1` for the loop to start executing properly.
   - The value of `n` must be greater than 0, as stated in the given conditions.

4. **Final state after adjustment**:
   - `i` should be `1` (not `n-1`).
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state after adjustment is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
