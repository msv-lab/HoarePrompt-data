Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is reduced by `n * m`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is 0.**

The code subtracts `n * m` from `k`. Here, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`, and `k` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
