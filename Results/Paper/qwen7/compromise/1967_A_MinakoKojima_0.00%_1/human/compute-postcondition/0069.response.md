Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the next positive integer input split from the input string, `k` is reduced by `n * m`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is 0, and `i` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= n * m` subtracts `n * m` from the current value of `k`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `k` being reduced by `n * m`.
