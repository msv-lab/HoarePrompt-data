Output State: **`ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0] * (a[3] - a[2]) * (a[4] - a[3])`, `i` is 4**.

Explanation: The initial state had `ans` being multiplied by `a[1] - a[0] * (a[3] - a[2])`. The code then updates `ans` by multiplying it with `a[i] - a[i - 1]`, where `i` is 4. Therefore, `ans` is now multiplied by the additional factor `(a[4] - a[3])`. The value of `i` remains 4, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 4 is still valid.
