Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query involves comparing the results of bitwise OR operations on pairs of indices.

2. **Analysis of the Given Code**:
   - The code iterates through the first \(n-1\) indices to find a potential candidate for \(ans1\). This part seems to be incomplete since `func_1` is called with the same index twice, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.
   - Then, it initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` to a list containing 0. It iterates through the remaining indices to find a better candidate for `ans1` by comparing the results of `func_1` calls.
   - After identifying potential candidates for `ans1`, it selects the best one and then iterates through the candidates to find the optimal pair \((ans, ans1)\) that maximizes the XOR value.
   - Finally, it prints the indices of the optimal pair.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The initial loop to find `ans1` is flawed because it calls `func_1` with the same index twice, which doesn't provide useful information.
   - The logic to find the best candidate for `ans1` and then the optimal pair \((ans, ans1)\) is not correctly implemented. It should involve comparing the results of the bitwise OR operations and using the comparison results to guide the search.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not correctly implement the logic to find the optimal pair of indices that maximize the XOR value. Therefore, it is likely to produce incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
