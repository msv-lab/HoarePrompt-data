Reasoning:

The provided solution aims to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously based on the given conditions. Let's break down the logic of the solution:

1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

2. **Conditions and Calculations**:
   - If `m < a` and `m < b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2. This is because the intervals between launches are larger than the visibility period, so only one firework from each installation can be visible at any given time.
   - If `m < a` and `m > b`, the calculation involves the number of fireworks from the second installation (`m // b`) plus 2 (one from each installation).
   - If `m < b` and `m > a`, similar logic applies but with the roles of `a` and `b` reversed.
   - In the general case, the formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is used, which accounts for the possibility of fireworks from both installations overlapping within the visibility period.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases where `m` is less than either `a` or `b`, ensuring that the correct number of simultaneous visible fireworks is calculated.
   - The use of integer division (`//`) ensures that the result is an integer, which is appropriate for counting the number of fireworks.

Given the logic and the conditions handled, the solution appears to correctly implement the required functionality based on the problem statement. There are no apparent logical errors or omissions in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
