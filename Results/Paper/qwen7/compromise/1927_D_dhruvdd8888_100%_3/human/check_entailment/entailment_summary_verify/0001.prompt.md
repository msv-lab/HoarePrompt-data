You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of queries on a given array. It first identifies segments of consecutive identical elements in the array and stores these segments along with their starting and ending indices. Then, for each query, it determines the segment that overlaps with the query range [l, r] and prints specific information based on the values within that segment. If no valid segment is found, it prints -1 -1. The function does not modify the original array or any other input parameters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N`, the array elements, and the number of queries `q`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It defines a function `func_1()` which processes each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads the array elements and appends `-1` to the end of the array.
   - It then iterates through the array to identify segments where the element changes and stores these segments in `arr`. Each segment is stored as a tuple `(start_index, end_index, value)`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment in `arr` that lies within the query range `[l, r]`.
   - Based on the position of the segment, it determines whether there exists a valid pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `a_i ≠ a_j` within the query range.

### Detailed Analysis of the Logic

1. **Segment Identification:**
   - The logic to identify segments where the element changes is correct. This helps in efficiently finding different elements within any query range.

2. **Binary Search Usage:**
   - The use of `bisect_left` to find the appropriate segment is correct. However, the handling of edge cases needs careful consideration.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles cases where no valid pair exists.
   - For cases where a valid pair exists, it correctly identifies the start and end indices of the segment and prints them.

### Potential Issues and Corrections

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles cases where the segment starts before `l` or ends after `r`.
   - However, the handling of cases where the segment exactly matches the query range `[l, r]` might need additional checks.

2. **Index Calculation:**
   - The index calculation for printing the result should be adjusted to ensure it fits within the query range `[l, r]`.

### Final Verification

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program appears to handle the problem correctly with the following minor adjustments:

- Ensure that the segment indices are within the query range `[l, r]`.
- Handle edge cases more explicitly to avoid off-by-one errors.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the code and considering the edge cases, the provided program is logically sound and should work correctly for the given problem statement.
