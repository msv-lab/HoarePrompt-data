Output State: **`s` is `N`, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array `a` consists of N+1 tuples where each tuple contains three elements: (1 + starting index, ending index, value at starting index), `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, and `e` is 0; `num` is equal to `nums[N]`; `arr` is a list containing `-1` and N+1 tuples of the form (1 + starting index, ending index, value at starting index); `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the list `arr` and subtracts 1 from it, storing the result in the variable `LA`. Since `arr` contains `-1` and N+1 tuples, its length is N+2. Therefore, `LA` is set to N+1. All other variables remain unchanged.
