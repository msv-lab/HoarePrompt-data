Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list at most 2 times; after executing the loop, the value of t remains unchanged, and for each test case, the variable tokens is an empty list, and the printed result is 0.

This means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the number of test cases (t) remains within the given range, and for each test case, the length of the unique tokens minus the length of the split tokens results in 0 because the tokens list is always empty after processing each line.
