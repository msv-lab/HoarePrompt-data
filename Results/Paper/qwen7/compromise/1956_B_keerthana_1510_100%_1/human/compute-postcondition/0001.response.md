Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the list a remains unchanged; after all iterations of the loop, the variable `tokens` is evaluated and printed for each line in the input, where the value printed is the difference between the length of the split line and the length of the set of tokens from that line.
