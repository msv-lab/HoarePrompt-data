Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The program attempts to process the input but fails to implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of points you can get based on the rules of the game. Specifically, the program calculates the difference between the number of unique tokens and the total number of tokens in a line, which is irrelevant to the problem's requirements.

According to the problem statement, the goal is to calculate the maximum number of points you can get by making optimal moves, considering Nene's strategy to maximize her score while minimizing yours. The program does not account for this strategic aspect and simply outputs 0 for every test case, which is incorrect.

Given the execution summary, the program indeed prints 0 for each test case, indicating that it does not perform the necessary calculations to determine the maximum points you can achieve.

Correctness: **False**
