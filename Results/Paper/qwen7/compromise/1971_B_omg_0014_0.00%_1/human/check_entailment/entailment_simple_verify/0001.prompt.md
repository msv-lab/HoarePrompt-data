You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: The output state will consist of multiple lines of 'YES' or 'NO', followed by either the reverse sorted string or the sorted string of the input provided in each iteration of the loop. The exact content depends on the input provided for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Checking for Unique Characters:**
   - It converts the string `s` into a set `a`. A set contains unique elements.
   - If the length of the set `a` is 2, it prints 'NO'. This means if the string has exactly two distinct characters, it cannot be rearranged to form a different string.

3. **Generating Rearranged Strings:**
   - If the length of the set `a` is not 2, it prints 'YES'.
   - It then sorts the string `s` in both ascending and descending order.
   - If the sorted string in ascending order (`b`) is equal to the original string `s`, it prints the sorted string in descending order (`c`).
   - Otherwise, it prints the sorted string in ascending order (`b`).

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Handling Strings with More Than Two Distinct Characters:**
   - The logic correctly identifies strings with exactly two distinct characters and outputs 'NO' for them.
   - However, for strings with more than two distinct characters, the program should generate a valid rearrangement that is different from the original string `s`.
   - The current implementation simply prints the sorted versions of the string, which may not always result in a different string from the original.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - Consider the string "abc". Sorting it in ascending order gives "abc" and in descending order gives "cba". Both are valid but not necessarily different from the original.
   - Consider the string "aaa". Sorting it in either order still results in "aaa", which is not a valid rearrangement.

### Example Test Cases to Validate:

1. **String "abc":**
   - Expected Output: "YES" followed by any valid rearrangement like "acb".
   - Actual Output: "YES" followed by "cba" (which is correct but not the only valid answer).

2. **String "aaa":**
   - Expected Output: "NO" since no rearrangement can be different.
   - Actual Output: "YES" followed by "aaa" (incorrect).

3. **String "abcd":**
   - Expected Output: "YES" followed by any valid rearrangement like "bacd".
   - Actual Output: "YES" followed by "abcd" (incorrect).

### Conclusion:

The program does not handle all edge cases correctly and does not guarantee a valid rearrangement for strings with more than two distinct characters. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
