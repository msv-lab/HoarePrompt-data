You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.

        n, k = map(int, input().split())

            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either `1`, `math.ceil(k / 2)`, or `k // 2 + 1`. The specific value on each line depends on the values of `n` and `k` provided for each test case. For each test case, if `k` equals 1, the output will be `1`. Otherwise, if `k` is less than or equal to `2 * (n + (n - 2))`, the output will be `math.ceil(k / 2)`. If `k` exceeds this value, the output will be `k // 2 + 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum number of cells to color when \( k > 2 \times (n + (n - 2)) \) is incorrect. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `4 7`
- Expected Output: `4`

However, the program outputs `4`, which seems correct at first glance. But let's analyze further:

For \( n = 4 \), the total number of diagonals is \( 4 \times 4 - 2 = 14 \). To satisfy \( k = 7 \), we need to ensure that 7 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The program calculates `k // 2 + 1` which is `4` for \( k = 7 \).

To verify, let's manually check if 4 cells can indeed cover 7 diagonals:
- One possible configuration is coloring the cells at positions (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), and (4,4). This covers 8 diagonals (4 main diagonals and 4 anti-diagonals).

Since 4 cells can cover 8 diagonals, the program's output of 4 is correct for this specific case. However, the issue arises when considering other configurations and larger values of \( n \) and \( k \).

For example, consider the case:
- Input: `5 10`
- Expected Output: `5`

The program outputs `5`, but let's see if 5 cells can cover 10 diagonals:
- One possible configuration is coloring the cells at positions (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), and (5,5). This covers 10 diagonals (5 main diagonals and 5 anti-diagonals).

This configuration works, but the program's logic might fail in more complex scenarios. For instance, if \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 11 \), the program would output `6`, but a manual check shows that 6 cells can indeed cover 11 diagonals.

Given these observations, the program's logic for handling the condition \( k > 2 \times (n + (n - 2)) \) is not robust enough to cover all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
