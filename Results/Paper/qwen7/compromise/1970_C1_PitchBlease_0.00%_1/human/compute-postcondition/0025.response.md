Output State: The `current` variable will be the node that is closest to the `target` among the nodes that have been visited so far, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited during the traversal, and `queue` is a deque containing tuples `(node, distance)` where each tuple represents a node and its distance from the `start` node, sorted by distance in ascending order.

This final state indicates that the breadth-first search (BFS) has completed traversing the tree, visiting all reachable nodes from the start node. The `current` node will be the last node processed, which is typically the node furthest from the start node within the BFS traversal path, unless the target node was found earlier. The `queue` contains all nodes in the order they were discovered, with their respective distances from the start node, ensuring that nodes closer to the start node are processed before those that are farther away.
