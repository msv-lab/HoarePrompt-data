Output State: **`current` is `neighbor`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `current`, and `neighbor`, `queue` is a list containing tuples `(neighbor, dist + 1)` appended with `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, if `neighbor` is not already in `visited`. If `neighbor` is already in `visited`, the `visited` set remains unchanged and `queue` contains the original tuple plus the new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.**

This means that the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` has been appended to the `queue`. The `current` and `start` variables remain unchanged, and the `target` and `visited` sets also remain unchanged unless `neighbor` was already in the `visited` set, in which case it stays as is.
