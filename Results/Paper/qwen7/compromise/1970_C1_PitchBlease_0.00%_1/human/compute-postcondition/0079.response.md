Functionality: **The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, both integers representing nodes in a tree. It performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is found, it returns the distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is not found, it returns -1. The function modifies the `visited` set to keep track of all nodes that have been checked and uses a queue to explore nodes level by level. After the function concludes, the `queue` is empty, the `visited` set contains all nodes that were checked, and the `tree` structure remains unchanged.**
