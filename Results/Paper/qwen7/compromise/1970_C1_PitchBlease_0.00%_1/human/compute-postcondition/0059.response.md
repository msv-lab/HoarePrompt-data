Output State: **`current` is the first element of `queue`, `dist` is the second element of `queue`, `queue` is the remaining elements of `queue` after removing the first element, `tree` must have at least one neighbor for `current`, `neighbor` is an element of `tree[current]`, `neighbor` is not in `visited`, and `visited` includes the element `neighbor`.**

Explanation: The code `visited.add(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` to the set `visited`. Since `neighbor` was not previously in `visited`, it is now added to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
