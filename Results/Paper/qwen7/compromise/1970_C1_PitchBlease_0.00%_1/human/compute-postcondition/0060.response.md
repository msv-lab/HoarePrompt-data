Output State: **`current` is the first element of `queue`, `dist` is the second element of `queue`, `queue` is the remaining elements of `queue` after removing the first element, `tree` must have at least one neighbor for `current`, `neighbor` is an element of `tree[current]`, `neighbor` is not in `visited`, and `visited` includes the element `neighbor`; `queue` now includes `(neighbor, dist + 1)` as its last element.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the end of the `queue`. This means that the `queue` now contains all its previous elements plus the new tuple. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
