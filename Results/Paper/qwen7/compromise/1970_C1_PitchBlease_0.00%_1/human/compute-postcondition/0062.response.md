Postcondition: `current` is the first element of `queue`, `dist` is the second element of `queue`, `queue` is the remaining elements of `queue` after removing the first element, `tree` must have at least one neighbor for `current`, `neighbor` is an element of `tree[current]`, and either `neighbor` is added to `visited` with `dist + 1` as its distance from the start, or `neighbor` is not in `visited` and `queue` now includes `(neighbor, dist + 1)` as its last element.
