Output State: The final postcondition will be such that `current` is the first element of `queue`, `dist` is the second element of `queue` (which represents the shortest distance from the start node to `current`), `queue` contains all nodes that can be reached from the start node, each with their respective distances, and `visited` contains all nodes that have been processed. The loop continues until there are no more neighbors for the current node in the `tree` that have not been visited, or until the target node is found and returned.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `current` will be the last node in the `queue` that still needs to be processed, `dist` will be the shortest distance from the start node to `current`, `queue` will contain all reachable nodes along with their distances from the start node, and `visited` will include all nodes that have been explored during the traversal.
