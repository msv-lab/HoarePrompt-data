Output State: **`dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`, `current` is the current node being processed, `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, the `neighbor` is not in the `visited` set, and `visited` now includes the `neighbor`.**

Explanation: The code adds the `neighbor` to the `visited` set. This means that the `neighbor` is now marked as visited, and the other conditions remain unchanged.
