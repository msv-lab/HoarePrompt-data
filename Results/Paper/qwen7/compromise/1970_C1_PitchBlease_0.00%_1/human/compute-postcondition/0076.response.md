Output State: The `current` node will be the target node, `dist` will hold the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `target` node, `queue` will be empty, and `visited` will contain all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, including the `start` and `target` nodes. The `tree` structure remains unchanged, and the loop terminates when the `target` node is found and its distance is returned.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the algorithm has successfully found the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. The `current` node will be the `target` node, `dist` will represent the shortest distance between them, `queue` will be empty because there are no more nodes to process, `visited` will include all nodes along the shortest path, and the `tree` structure remains the same as when the loop started.
