Output State: **`current` is the first element of `queue`, `dist` is the second element of `queue` plus 1, `queue` is the remaining elements of `queue` after removing the first element, `tree` must have at least one neighbor for `current`, `neighbor` is added to `visited`, and `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is appended to `queue`.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that the `queue` now contains the original elements (with the first element being `current` and the second being `dist` plus 1) plus the new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
