Based on the initial state described, the value of `a` is printed out character by character in the same order it was initially. However, the initial state does not provide the specific value of `a`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact characters that will be printed without knowing the value of `a`.

Output: **the characters of `a` (where `a` is the initial value that is printed character by character)**
