Output State: **`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, `x` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `y` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `x[0]` to `x[n-1]` are all `None`, and the values of `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, and `bipartite` remain unchanged.**

This means that the list `y` has been initialized to a list of `None` values with the same length as `x`. All other variables retain their original values from the initial state.
