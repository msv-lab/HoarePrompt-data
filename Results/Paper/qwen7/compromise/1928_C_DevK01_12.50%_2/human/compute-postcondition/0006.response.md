Postcondition: `q` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 100, `M` is a list containing the integer division of `w` by 1, and `w` is the square root of `q`. If the current value of `w` is equal to its integer division by 1 and is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `M` contains the integer division of `w` by 1.
