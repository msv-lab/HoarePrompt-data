You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ q ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and n are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if (w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1) :
        M += [w]
    #State: Postcondition: `q` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 100, `M` is a list containing the integer division of `w` by 1, and `w` is the square root of `q`. If the current value of `w` is equal to its integer division by 1 and is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `M` contains the integer division of `w` by 1.
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):

            if i >= x - 1:

    #State: q is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, M is an empty list, w is the integer part of the square root of q, and x is not used or defined in the final state.
    return M
    #The program returns an empty list M
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`. `q` represents the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ q ≤ 100. For each test case, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. The function calculates the integer part of the square root of `q` and checks if it meets certain conditions. If these conditions are satisfied, it adds the integer part of the square root or its divisors to the list `M`. Finally, the function returns an empty list `M`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `x` for each case.

2. **Calculating `y`:**
   - `y = n + x` is calculated, which is necessary for determining the possible values of `k`.

3. **Checking Parity of `y`:**
   - If `y` is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if `y` is odd, no valid `k` can exist since `2k - 2` must be even.

4. **Calling `func_1`:**
   - If `y` is even, it calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` and stores the result in `L1`.
   - It then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2`, and if true, it adds the result of `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to `L1`.

5. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - `L1` is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then the length of the set is printed.

6. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` calculates the divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - This function is used to find valid `k` values.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`:

- **Divisor Calculation:**
  - The function correctly identifies all divisors of the input `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
  - It uses a loop to check for divisors from `1` to `int(w // 1)`, where `w` is the square root of `q`.

### Correctness Verification:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case when `y` is odd correctly by printing `0`.
  - The function `func_1` correctly identifies valid `k` values by checking divisors.

- **Logic Flow:**
  - The logic flow is correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

- **Output:**
  - The output matches the expected results provided in the example.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
