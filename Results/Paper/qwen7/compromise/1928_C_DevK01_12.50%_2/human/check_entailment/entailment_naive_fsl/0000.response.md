Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid `k` values. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not used correctly, and the logic for determining the valid `k` values is flawed.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to find divisors of a number, but it is not used correctly in the main logic.
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`, and if `y` is even, the program attempts to find valid `k` values using `func_1`.
   - However, the logic for determining the valid `k` values is incorrect. The function `func_1` returns a list of divisors, but these divisors do not directly correspond to valid `k` values.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid `k` Values:**
   - The logic for calculating the number of valid `k` values is flawed. The program should check the periodicity of the sequence and the position `x` to determine the valid `k` values.
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the periodic nature of the sequence and the position `x`.

To fix the program, you need to correctly implement the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values based on the position `x` and the length `n`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    # Check if n + x is even
    if (n + x) % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    y = (n + x) // 2
    # Find the range of possible k values
    start = max(x - 1, 2)
    end = min(y, n - x + 1)
    for k in range(start, end + 1):
        if (n + x) % (2 * k - 2) == 0:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version correctly handles the periodic nature of the sequence and calculates the number of valid `k` values based on the position `x` and the length `n`.
