Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `x`.

2. **Calculation of `y`:**
   - `y = n + x` is calculated, which is necessary for determining the possible values of `k`.

3. **Check for Validity of `y`:**
   - If `y` is odd, the program prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if `y` is odd, it cannot be expressed as `2k - 2`, which is even.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to find all divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The logic in `func_1` is to find divisors of `q` that are at least `x - 1`. This is crucial for determining valid values of `k`.

5. **Combining Results:**
   - The results from `func_1` are combined and converted to a set to remove duplicates.
   - The length of this set is printed, which gives the number of valid `k` values.

### Detailed Check:

1. **Odd `y`:**
   - If `y` is odd, the settling pattern does not exist, hence the program correctly outputs `0`.

2. **Divisor Calculation:**
   - The divisor calculation in `func_1` ensures that only relevant divisors are considered.
   - Specifically, for each divisor `d` of `q`, if `d >= x - 1`, it is included in the result. This ensures that the divisors correspond to valid `k` values.

3. **Combining Results:**
   - The combination of results from both calls to `func_1` and the conversion to a set ensure that all unique valid `k` values are counted.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like when `n` is large and `x` is small, ensuring that all possible valid `k` values are considered.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values based on the input constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
