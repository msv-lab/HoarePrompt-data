Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by splitting the input into `n` and `x`.

2. **Condition Checking**: The program checks if `y = n + x` is even. If not, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if `y` is odd, no valid `k` can be found since the settling pattern alternates between odd and even positions.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find potential values of `k` based on the given `q` and `x`.
   - It calculates the integer part of the square root of `q` and checks if it meets certain conditions.
   - It also checks divisors of `q` and adds them to the list `M` if they meet the conditions.

4. **Logic for `func_1`**:
   - If the integer part of the square root of `q` (`w`) is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it is added to `M`.
   - It iterates through all divisors of `q` and adds those that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` to `M`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the length of the set `L1`, which contains unique values of `k` that satisfy the conditions.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem statement and the provided examples. The function `func_1` seems to accurately identify the possible values of `k` based on the input parameters.

Correctness: **True**
