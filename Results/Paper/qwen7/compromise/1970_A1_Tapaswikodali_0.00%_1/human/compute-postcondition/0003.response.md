Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for (i, char) in enumerate(s):`. The objects involved here are `i`, `char`, and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `s` is a string consisting only of characters `(` and `)`.
   - `balance` is 0.
   - `details` is an empty list.

3. **Understand what the loop does**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` using `enumerate()`, which provides both the index `i` and the character `char` at that index.

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - Since the loop uses `enumerate(s)`, the string `s` must be non-empty for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.
   - The variable `char` will take the value of each character in `s` during each iteration.

Given the above points, we need to ensure that `s` is non-empty for the loop to start executing. The other variables `balance` and `details` do not affect the loop's ability to start, as they are not used in the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `s` must be a non-empty string.
- `i` must start from 0.
- `char` will be the first character of `s` in the first iteration.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character of `s`**
