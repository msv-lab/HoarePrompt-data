### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Balance Calculation:**
   - The program correctly reads the input string `s` and iterates through each character.
   - It calculates the balance of the parentheses sequence by incrementing the balance for an opening parenthesis `(` and decrementing it for a closing parenthesis `)`.

2. **Details List Construction:**
   - For each character, the program appends a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the `details` list.
   - Using `-i` ensures that when sorting by balance, characters with the same balance will be sorted in decreasing order of their original positions.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The `details` list is sorted based on the balance values in ascending order and positions in descending order.
   - Sorting by balance first ensures that the prefixes' balances are correctly ordered, and the secondary sorting by position ensures that sequences with the same balance are ordered from right to left in the original string.

4. **Result Construction:**
   - The program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list.

5. **Output:**
   - The result string is printed, which should be the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

Given the problem description and the implementation, the program appears to correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as defined.

### Correctness:
**True**
