You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join((char for (_, _, char) in details))
    print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses and generates a new string based on the balance of parentheses at each position. It calculates the balance of parentheses as it iterates through the string, records this balance along with the character and its position (using negative indexing), sorts these records, and then constructs a new string from the characters in the order of their recorded balances. Finally, it prints the original string `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Balance Calculation:**
   - The program correctly reads the input string `s` and iterates through each character.
   - It calculates the balance of the parentheses sequence by incrementing the balance for an opening parenthesis `(` and decrementing it for a closing parenthesis `)`.

2. **Details List Construction:**
   - For each character, the program appends a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the `details` list.
   - Using `-i` ensures that when sorting by balance, characters with the same balance will be sorted in decreasing order of their original positions.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The `details` list is sorted based on the balance values in ascending order and positions in descending order.
   - Sorting by balance first ensures that the prefixes' balances are correctly ordered, and the secondary sorting by position ensures that sequences with the same balance are ordered from right to left in the original string.

4. **Result Construction:**
   - The program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list.

5. **Output:**
   - The result string is printed, which should be the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

Given the problem description and the implementation, the program appears to correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as defined.
