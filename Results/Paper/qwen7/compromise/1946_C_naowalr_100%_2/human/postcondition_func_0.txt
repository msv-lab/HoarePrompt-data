The function processes a series of input data sets representing tree structures. Each data set contains an integer t, followed by integers n and k, and then n-1 lines describing the edges of the tree. For each set, the `solve()` function is called to process the tree data. After processing all sets, the value of t is reduced by the number of sets processed. The function does not return any value but modifies the input data by decrementing t and performing operations on the tree structure as specified by n, k, and the edges.
