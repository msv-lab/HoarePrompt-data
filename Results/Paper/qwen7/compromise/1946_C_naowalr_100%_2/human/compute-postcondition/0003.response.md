Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a tree structure defined by a series of input data sets. Each data set includes an integer t, followed by pairs of integers n and k, and then n-1 lines describing the edges of the tree. The function returns information based on the tree structure and the values of n and k.**

This means the function does not take any parameters when called directly but expects input data to be provided in a specific format, which includes the integer t, two integers n and k, and n-1 lines describing the edges of a tree. Based on this input, the function processes the tree structure and returns relevant information.
