Output State: **`count` is 0, `results` is `[0]`, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array, `x` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `arr` is the next test case array, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `r_x` as `-num % x`. The value of `r_x` depends on the values of `num` and `x`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
