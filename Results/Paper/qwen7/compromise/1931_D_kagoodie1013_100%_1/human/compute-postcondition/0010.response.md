Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `num` from the list `arr`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `arr`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `count` is 0 + the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, where `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x` and `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`.
   - `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(r_x, r_y)` having a value of 1.
   - `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `arr`, the next value of `num` will be the next element in the list.
   - The `count` will be recalculated based on the new `num`.
   - The `residue_map` and `current_key` will be updated based on the new `num`.

5. **Determine the New State**:
   - `test_cases` remains unchanged as it is not used in the loop.
   - `results` remains an empty list as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `count` will be recalculated using the new `num`.
   - `residue_map` will be updated with the new `current_key`.
   - `current_key` will be updated to `num % x, num % y`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated values of `count`, `residue_map`, and `current_key`.

**State:**
- `test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `count` is 0 + the value of `residue_map.get((new_r_x, new_r_y), 0)`, where `new_r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x` and `new_r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`.
- `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(new_r_x, new_r_y)` having a value of 1.
- `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`.

Since the exact values of `new_r_x` and `new_r_y` depend on the specific `num` from the next iteration, we cannot provide concrete values without knowing the next `num` from `arr`. However, the structure of the state remains the same.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0 + the value of `residue_map.get((new_r_x, new_r_y), 0)`, where `new_r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x` and `new_r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(new_r_x, new_r_y)` having a value of 1, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`.**
