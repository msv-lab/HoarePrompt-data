Output State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0 + the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x`, `arr` must have at least one element, `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`**.

This means that the `count` variable has been incremented by the value returned by `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`. The value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` is either the value associated with the key `(r_x, r_y)` in `residue_map` (if it exists) or 0 (if the key does not exist). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
