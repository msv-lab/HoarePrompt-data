Output State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple; `results` is an empty list; `count` is updated to the sum of the previous count and the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, where `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x` and `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`; `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(new_r_x, new_r_y)` having a value of 1, where `new_r_x` and `new_r_y` are derived from the new `num`; `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`; `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `r_y` as the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`. This value is stored in `r_y`, but none of the other variables are directly affected by this line of code. The `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `residue_map`, `current_key`, and `num` retain their previous states except for the addition of `r_y`.
