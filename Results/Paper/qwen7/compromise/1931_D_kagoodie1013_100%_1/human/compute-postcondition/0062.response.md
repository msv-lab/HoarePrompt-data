Output State: **`count` is 0 + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0); `results` is [0]; `residue_map` is {(current_key): 1}; `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array; `x` is the second element of the next test case tuple; `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple; `arr` is the next test case array without the first element; `num` is the second element of `arr`; `r_y` is num % y; `current_key` is (num % x, num % y)**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `current_key` to `(num % x, num % y)`. This means that `current_key` now holds the tuple `(num % x, num % y)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
