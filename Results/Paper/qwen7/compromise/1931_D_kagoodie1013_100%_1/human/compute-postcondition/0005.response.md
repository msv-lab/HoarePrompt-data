Output State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple, results is an empty list, count is 0, residue_map is an empty dictionary, `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x`, `arr` must have at least one element.**

Explanation: The code snippet `r_x = -num % x` calculates the remainder when `-num` is divided by `x` and assigns it to `r_x`. The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `residue_map`, `num`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
