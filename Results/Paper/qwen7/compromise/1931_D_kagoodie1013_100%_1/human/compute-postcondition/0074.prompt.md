Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) followed by a list of \( n \) integers representing the array \( a \); `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    count = 0
    residue_map = {}
    for num in arr:
        r_x = -num % x
        r_y = num % y
        count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
        current_key = num % x, num % y
        residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple, `results` is a list containing one element which is the cumulative sum of the values of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each iteration, `count` is the cumulative sum of the values of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each iteration, `residue_map` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair derived from the loop, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y` for the last iteration, `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x` for the last iteration, `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y` for the last iteration, and `residue_map[current_key]` is updated to the value of `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1` for the last iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` reflects the cumulative sum of occurrences of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` across all elements in `arr`, and `residue_map` records how many times each unique pair `(num % x, num % y)` appears in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `count` is 6, `results` is [6], `residue_map` is `{(2, 2): 3}`, `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array minus 3, `x` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `arr` is the next test case array without the first three elements, `num` is the fourth element of `arr`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is (num % x, num % y).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
