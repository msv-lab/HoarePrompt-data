Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `count` is increased by the sum of all values of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each `num` in `arr`. For every `num` processed, `residue_map[(num % x, num % y)]` is incremented by 1. The variable `r_x` is calculated as `-num % x`, and `r_y` is calculated as `num % y`. The `current_key` is updated to `(num % x, num % y)` for each iteration. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, and `arr` contains all the original elements it started with, assuming no additional elements were added or removed during the loop execution.

In summary, `count` reflects the cumulative sum of occurrences of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` across all elements in `arr`, and `residue_map` records how many times each unique pair `(num % x, num % y)` appears in `arr`.
