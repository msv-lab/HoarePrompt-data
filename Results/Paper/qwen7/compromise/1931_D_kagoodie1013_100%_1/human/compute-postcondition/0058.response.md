Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `num` and `arr`.
   - `num` is the current element being processed from the array `arr`.
   - `arr` is the array from which `num` is taken.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `count` is 0.
   - `results` is `[0]`.
   - `residue_map` is `{(num % x, num % y): 1}`.
   - `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array.
   - `x` is the second element of the next test case tuple.
   - `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple.
   - `arr` is the next test case array.
   - `num` is the first element of `arr`.
   - `r_y = num % y`.
   - `current_key = (num % x, num % y)`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `num` in the array `arr`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the first element of `arr` in the current iteration, after processing `num`, the next `num` will be the second element of `arr`.
   - The array `arr` will be consumed one element at a time, so it will have one less element after each iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `num` should be set to the next element in `arr`.
- `arr` should be reduced by one element.

Since the loop is iterating over `arr`, and assuming the loop has just finished processing one element, the next `num` will be the second element of `arr`, and `arr` will be reduced by one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`count` is 0, `results` is `[0]`, `residue_map` is `{(num % x, num % y): 1}`, `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array, `x` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `arr` is the next test case array without the first element, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `r_y = num % y`, `current_key = (num % x, num % y)`**.
