Output State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `count` is the value of `residue_map.get((new_r_x, new_r_y), 0)`, where `new_r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x` and `new_r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(new_r_x, new_r_y)` having a value of 1, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`, `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num % y` to `r_y`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `r_y` is updated to the remainder of `num % y`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
