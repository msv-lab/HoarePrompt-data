Output State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple; `results` is an empty list; `count` is updated to the sum of the previous count and the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, where `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x` and `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`; `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(new_r_x, new_r_y)` having a value of 1, where `new_r_x` and `new_r_y` are derived from the new `num`; `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`; `num` is the next element in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `r_x` as the remainder of `-num % x`. This value is used to update `count` by adding the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, where `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`. It also updates `residue_map` with the key `(new_r_x, new_r_y)` set to 1, where `new_r_x` and `new_r_y` are derived from the new `num`. The `current_key` remains `num % x, num % y`, and `num` is set to the next element in `arr`. The initial conditions for `test_cases`, `results`, and their relationships remain unchanged.
