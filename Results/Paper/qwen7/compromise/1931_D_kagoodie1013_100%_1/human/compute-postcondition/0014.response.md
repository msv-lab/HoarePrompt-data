Output State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `count` is the sum of the previous count and the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(new_r_x, new_r_y)` having a value of 1, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`, `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`, `current_key` is updated to `num % x, num % y`.**

The code updates the `current_key` to `num % x, num % y`, but does not affect any other variables or lists. Therefore, the values of `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `residue_map`, `r_x`, and `r_y` remain unchanged except for the update to `current_key`.
