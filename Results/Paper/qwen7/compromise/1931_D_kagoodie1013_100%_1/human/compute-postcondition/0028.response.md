Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code snippet is `for num in arr:`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `test_cases` is a list that must have at least two tuples.
   - `count` is 0.
   - `residue_map` is an empty dictionary.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over `arr`, `arr` must contain at least one element. Therefore, `arr` must have at least one element.
   - The variables `num` and `count` and `residue_map` are not directly involved in determining if the loop can execute. However, since the loop body is omitted, we do not need to specify their values explicitly unless they are required for the loop to proceed.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are related to `arr` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least two tuples, `arr` must have at least one element**
