Output State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `count` is the sum of the previous count and the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(new_r_x, new_r_y)` having a value of 1, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`, `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`**.

Explanation: The code updates the `count` variable by adding the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`. Here, `r_x` and `r_y` are defined as the remainders of `-num % x` and `num % y` respectively, and the value of `residue_map.get((new_r_x, new_r_y), 0)` is 1 because the key `(new_r_x, new_r_y)` exists in the dictionary. Therefore, `count` is incremented by 1. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
