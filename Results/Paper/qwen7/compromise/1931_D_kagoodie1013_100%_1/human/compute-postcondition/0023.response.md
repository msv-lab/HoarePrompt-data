Output State: `test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `count` is the cumulative sum of the values of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each iteration, `residue_map` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair derived from the loop, where `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x` and `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y` for the last iteration, `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x` for the last iteration, `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y` for the last iteration, and `residue_map[current_key]` is updated to the value of `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1` for the last iteration.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `count` variable will hold the total occurrences of any `(r_x, r_y)` pair across all iterations, the `residue_map` dictionary will contain the frequency of each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair encountered during the loop, and the `current_key` will reflect the last `(r_x, r_y)` pair computed from the last iteration's `num`.
