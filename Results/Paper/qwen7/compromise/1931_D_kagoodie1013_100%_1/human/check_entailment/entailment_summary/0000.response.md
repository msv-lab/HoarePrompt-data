Reasoning:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and then splits it into parts. This approach ensures that the input is processed efficiently, especially for large inputs.

2. **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, the program extracts the necessary parameters (`n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`). It then iterates through each element of the array to compute the residues `r_x` and `r_y`.

3. **Residue Calculation**:
   - `r_x = -num % x`: This calculates the remainder when `-num` is divided by `x`. This is equivalent to `(x - (num % x)) % x` if `num % x` is not zero.
   - `r_y = num % y`: This directly computes the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.

4. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - A dictionary `residue_map` keeps track of the frequency of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)`.
   - For each element `num` in the array, the program checks how many times the pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before. This count is added to the `count` variable.
   - The current pair `(r_x, r_y)` is then updated in the `residue_map`.

5. **Result Collection**: The count of beautiful pairs for each test case is collected in the `results` list and returned.

6. **Output**: The results are printed in the required format.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program should correctly count the number of beautiful pairs for each test case as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
