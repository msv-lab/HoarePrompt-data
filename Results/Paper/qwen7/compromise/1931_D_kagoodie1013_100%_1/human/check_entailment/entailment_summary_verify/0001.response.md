### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified that the program was almost correct but needed a small adjustment in the calculation of `r_x`. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and parses it into test cases.
   - Each test case consists of `n`, `x`, `y`, and an array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates through each test case and processes the array.
   - It initializes a counter `count` and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the residues.
   - For each element `num` in the array, it calculates `r_x` and `r_y`:
     - `r_x = (x - (num % x)) % x`: This ensures that `r_x` is correctly calculated to satisfy the condition `(num + r_x) % x == 0`.
     - `r_y = num % y`: This correctly calculates the residue such that `(num - r_y) % y == 0`.
   - It then checks if this combination of residues exists in `residue_map` and increments the count accordingly.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current element's residues.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating `r_x` is now correct. The original assessment was accurate in pointing out the mistake and providing the correct formula.
   - The rest of the logic follows the problem statement correctly.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The program outputs the number of beautiful pairs for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given that the program now correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs, the original assessment was accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct after the necessary adjustment in the calculation of `r_x`.
