Output State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in `b` is mapped to a character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`. Specifically, the character with the highest frequency in the sorted unique set of `b` will map to 'z', the next highest to 'y', and so on, until the least frequent maps to 'a'.
