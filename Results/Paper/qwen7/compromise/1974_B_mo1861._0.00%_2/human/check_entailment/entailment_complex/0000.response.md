Reasoning:

1. **Function Logic Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly constructs a character mapping (`char_map`) from the unique characters in the encoded string `b` to their corresponding decoded characters. The mapping is done in reverse order of the sorted unique characters, ensuring that the most frequent character in the sorted unique set of `b` maps to 'z', the next to 'y', and so on.
   - For each character in `b`, the function uses this mapping to construct the decoded string `s`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles all edge cases correctly, including strings with repeated characters and strings with only one character.

3. **Input and Output**:
   - The function takes an encoded string `b` and returns the decoded string `s` as required.
   - The logic ensures that the decoding process is accurate and consistent with the encoding process described in the problem statement.

4. **Comments and States**:
   - The comments accurately describe the state of the program at various points, providing clear insight into the function's behavior.
   - The final state of `char_map` and `s` aligns with the expected outcomes.

Given the analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
