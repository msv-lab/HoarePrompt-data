You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s`. Each character in `b` is replaced by another character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to decode a given encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`. The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` with unique characters of `s` sorted alphabetically, and then replacing each character in `s` with its corresponding symmetric character in `r`.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - To decode, we need to reverse the mapping used during encoding. This means finding the symmetric position of each character in `b` within `r`.
   - The provided function `func_1` attempts to create a mapping from each unique character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

3. **Analysis of the Provided Code**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `b` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
     - It sorts the unique characters of `b` to form `r`.
     - It maps each character in `r` to its symmetric position in `r`, which is calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.
   - The decoding process then uses this map to replace each character in `b` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

4. **Testing with Examples**:
   - For the example `"serofedsoc"`, the auxiliary string `r` is `"cdefors"`. The symmetric mapping would be:
     - `s` -> `c`
     - `e` -> `d`
     - `r` -> `f`
     - `o` -> `e`
     - `f` -> `r`
     - `d` -> `s`
     - `c` -> `o`
     - `s` -> `c`
     - `o` -> `e`
     - `c` -> `o`
   - Applying these mappings, the decoded string is `"codeforces"`, which matches the expected output.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Single-character strings like `"w"` are handled correctly since there's only one character, and it maps to itself.
   - Longer strings like `"hnndledmnhlttin"` are also correctly decoded.

Given the analysis, the provided function correctly decodes the encoded strings according to the problem description.
