### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another under the constraint that the index `i` must be less than `j`.

2. **Key Insight**: Given that the sum of the amounts of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers (`n`), it is always possible to distribute the water such that each container has an equal amount of water. This is because the average amount of water per container is an integer.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - If the total is divisible by `n`, it calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`mean`).
   - It then iterates through the list of amounts and keeps a running difference (`curr`) between the current sum and the target sum.
   - The running difference `curr` is used to ensure that the distribution process does not go below zero, which would indicate an impossible distribution.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'NO', it means the distribution is possible, and it returns 'YES'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the total amount of water is not divisible by `n` by returning 'NO' immediately.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the distribution is possible by ensuring the running difference never goes negative.

5. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The program reads the input correctly and processes each test case independently.
   - The output format matches the requirements.

6. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points, aligning with the algorithm's logic.
   - The function correctly processes each test case and outputs the expected result.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately describes the functionality and correctness of the provided program. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

### Final:
**True**
