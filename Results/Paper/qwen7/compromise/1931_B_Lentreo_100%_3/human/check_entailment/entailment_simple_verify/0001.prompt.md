You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container, where the length of nums is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) and the sum of the integers in nums is divisible by n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^9).
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if (total % n != 0) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `nums` is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`. The total sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`.
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: Output State: curr is -n, nums is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container, n is the length of nums, total is the sum of all elements in nums, and mean is the integer division of total by n.
    #
    #Explanation: After iterating through all elements in `nums`, `curr` accumulates the difference between each element and the mean. If at any point `curr` becomes less than 0, the function returns 'NO'. If the loop completes without returning, `curr` will be the sum of all differences from the mean, which is equivalent to `-n` because each element in `nums` contributes to making `curr` less than 0 exactly once before the loop ends.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another under the constraint that the index `i` must be less than `j`.

2. **Key Insight**: Given that the sum of the amounts of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers (`n`), it is always possible to distribute the water such that each container has an equal amount of water. This is because the average amount of water per container is an integer.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - If the total is divisible by `n`, it calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`mean`).
   - It then iterates through the list of amounts and keeps a running difference (`curr`) between the current sum and the target sum.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means the distribution is not possible, and it returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'NO', it means the distribution is possible, and it returns 'YES'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the total amount of water is not divisible by `n` by returning 'NO' immediately.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the distribution is possible by ensuring the running difference never goes negative.

5. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The program reads the input correctly and processes each test case independently.
   - The output format matches the requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.
