Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        
        a = set()
        
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, `i` will be the last character of the original string `s` after all iterations, `s` will be an empty string, `a` will be a set containing all unique characters from the original string `s` for each iteration, and `newstr` will be either the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s.strip()` with the first half of `s.strip()` if the length of `a` is greater than 1, or it will be the original string `s.strip()` if `newstr` is equal to `s.strip()`, or it will be an empty string if the length of `a` is less than or equal to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) followed by a string `s` of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains more than one unique character. If so, it rearranges `s` by moving the second half to the front and prints the result. If the rearranged string is not a palindrome, it prints the rearranged string; otherwise, it prints the reverse of the original string. If the string `s` contains one or zero unique characters, it prints 'NO'. The function ultimately outputs information about each test case based on the conditions described.
