Postcondition: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is the first character in the string `s.strip()`, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s.strip()`. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s.strip()` with the first half of `s.strip()`. If `newstr` is not equal to the original string `s.strip()`, then `newstr` remains unchanged. If `newstr` is equal to `s.strip()`, then `newstr` is set to the original string `s.strip()`. If the length of `a` is less than or equal to 1, `newstr` is either an empty string or equal to `s.strip()`.
