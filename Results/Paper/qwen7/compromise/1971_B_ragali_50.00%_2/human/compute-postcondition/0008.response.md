Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in s`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is a character from the string `s`, and `s` must be a non-empty string.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must still contain at least one character.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is a character from the string `s`, after processing one character, `i` will be updated to the next character in `s`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must still be a non-empty string.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` will be the next character in `s`.
- `s` must still be a non-empty string.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is a character from the string `s`, `s` must be a non-empty string (and will have at least one less character than before)**.
