### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided functions and their logic in detail to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Function `func_2`
This function checks if a solution exists:
- If \( k \) is odd, it immediately returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value of any permutation must be even.
- If \( n \) is odd, the maximum possible Manhattan value is \(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\).
- If \( n \) is even, the maximum possible Manhattan value is \(\frac{n^2}{2}\).
- If \( k \) exceeds these maximum values, it returns `(0, 0)`.

This part of the function is correct and handles edge cases well.

#### Function `func_1`
This function constructs the permutation:
- It starts with a list of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
- It iteratively moves the last element to the front until the required Manhattan value is achieved.
- The logic seems to decrement \( k \) by the index positions as it moves elements.

However, this approach has several issues:
- The function does not guarantee that the resulting permutation will have the exact Manhattan value \( k \). It simply tries to reduce \( k \) by moving elements, which may not always result in the correct permutation.
- The function does not handle all possible values of \( k \) correctly. For example, if \( k \) is very large, the function may not be able to construct the correct permutation.

#### Function `func_3`
This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation:
- It takes a list `l` as input and prints it.

This function is correct.

#### Function `func_4`
This function orchestrates the process:
- It calls `func_2` to check if a solution exists.
- If a solution exists, it calls `func_1` to construct the permutation and then `func_3` to print it.
- If no solution exists, it prints "NO".

This function is mostly correct, but it relies on the correctness of `func_1`, which is flawed.

### Testing and Edge Cases

1. **Edge Case: \( n = 1 \), \( k = 1 \):**
   - The only permutation is `[1]`, and the Manhattan value is \( |1 - 1| = 0 \).
   - The function should return "NO" because \( k = 1 \) cannot be achieved.
   - However, the current implementation incorrectly returns a permutation `[1]` with a Manhattan value of 0.

2. **Edge Case: \( n = 1 \), \( k = 0 \):**
   - The only permutation is `[1]`, and the Manhattan value is \( |1 - 1| = 0 \).
   - The function should return "YES" with the permutation `[1]`.
   - The current implementation correctly returns "YES" with the permutation `[1]`.

3. **General Case:**
   - For larger \( n \) and \( k \), the function should correctly construct a permutation if one exists.
   - However, the function `func_1` may not always produce the correct permutation, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion

The code has significant issues, particularly in `func_1`, where the logic for constructing the permutation is flawed. The function does not guarantee that the resulting permutation will have the exact Manhattan value \( k \). Therefore, the overall correctness of the program is compromised.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
