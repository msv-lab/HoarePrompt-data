### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given functions and their summaries to evaluate the correctness of the program.

1. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function checks if a valid permutation exists for the given `n` and `k`.
   - It returns `(0, 0)` if no valid permutation exists.
   - If `k` is odd, it immediately returns `(0, 0)` since the Manhattan value must be even.
   - For even `k`, it calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for the given `n` and compares it with `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function constructs a permutation based on `n` and `k`.
   - It starts with a list of numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - It iteratively modifies this list by moving the last element to different positions until it either reaches the desired `k` or exhausts all possibilities.
   - The logic seems to attempt to reduce the Manhattan value by strategically moving elements, but it may not always achieve the exact `k` for all cases.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation and returns nothing.

4. **Function `func_4`:**
   - This function orchestrates the overall logic.
   - It first calls `func_2` to check if a valid permutation exists.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to construct the permutation and then calls `func_3` to print the result.

### Analysis:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Correctly identifies if a valid permutation exists by checking if `k` is even and if the maximum possible Manhattan value is at least `k`.
   - Handles the edge case where `k` is odd correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It does not guarantee that the resulting permutation will have the exact Manhattan value `k`.
   - The approach of moving the last element to different positions is too simplistic and may miss the correct permutation for some values of `n` and `k`.

3. **Function `func_4`**:
   - Integrates the logic correctly by ensuring that `func_1` is called only when a valid permutation is possible.
   - Properly handles the case where no permutation exists.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program fails to correctly generate a permutation with the specified Manhattan value for all cases. Specifically, `func_1` does not ensure that the resulting permutation has the exact Manhattan value `k` for all inputs, leading to incorrect results for certain test cases.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
