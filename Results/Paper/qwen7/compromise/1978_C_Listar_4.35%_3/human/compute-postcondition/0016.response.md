Output State: **The program returns n and k, where n is an integer and k is an integer, and max_k is set to n (since n is even) and is not less than k.**

This means that the program returns two integers, `n` and `k`. The value of `max_k` is set to `n` because `n` is even, and `max_k` is also not less than `k`.
