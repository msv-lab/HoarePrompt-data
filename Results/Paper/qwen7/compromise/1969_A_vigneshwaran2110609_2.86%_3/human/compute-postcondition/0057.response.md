Postcondition: `i` is 0, `x` must be at least 12, and after the execution of the if-else block, if the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is true, then the first element of list `l` is equal to 0 and the second element of list `l` is also equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, no changes occur to the elements of list `l`.
