Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `x`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `x` is between 1 and 50 inclusive
   - The first element of list `l` at index `l[0] - 1` is equal to `l[0] - 1`
   - `flag` is True
   - If `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` becomes 2
   - `x` remains between 1 and 50 inclusive (no change)
   - The first element of list `l` at index `l[0] - 1` remains equal to `l[0] - 1` (no change)
   - `flag` remains True (no change)

Based on the above steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `x` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, the first element of list `l` at index `l[0] - 1` is equal to `l[0] - 1`, `flag` is True**
