Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and the list `p` is still defined with the same conditions but hasn't been initialized yet. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` and retains the conditions for `t` and `p`.
