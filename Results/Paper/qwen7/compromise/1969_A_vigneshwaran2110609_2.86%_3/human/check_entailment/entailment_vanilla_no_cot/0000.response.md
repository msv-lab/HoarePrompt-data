Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Logic Error**: The program checks if `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` for each element in the list. This condition is checking if the best friend of the best friend of a person is the same person, which is not relevant to the problem. Instead, we need to ensure that each invited friend's best friend also receives an invitation.

2. **Minimum Invitations Calculation**: The program attempts to print `2` if it finds any pair where both friends are best friends of each other. However, this logic is flawed because it doesn't guarantee that at least 2 friends will come to the party. Additionally, the program prints `3` if no such pair is found, but this might not be the optimal solution.

3. **Optimal Solution**: To find the minimum number of invitations, we need to identify cycles in the best friend relationships. If there is a cycle of length 2 or more, we can invite friends from that cycle to ensure that at least 2 friends come. If there are no such cycles, we need to invite at least 3 friends to ensure at least 2 come.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Create a dictionary to map each friend to their best friend
        best_friends = {i + 1: l[i] for i in range(n)}
        
        # Check for cycles
        visited = set()
        for friend in range(1, n + 1):
            if friend not in visited:
                current = friend
                cycle_length = 0
                while current not in visited:
                    visited.add(current)
                    current = best_friends[current]
                    cycle_length += 1
                
                # If cycle length is 2 or more, we can invite all friends in the cycle
                if cycle_length >= 2:
                    print(cycle_length)
                    break
        else:
            # If no cycle of length 2 or more, we need to invite at least 3 friends
            print(3)

func()
```

This corrected version identifies cycles in the best friend relationships and ensures that at least 2 friends come to the party with the minimum number of invitations.
