Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program incorrectly handles the input for each test case. It reads `n` and then seems to read `x` which is not defined in the problem statement. Instead, it should directly read the list `p`.

2. **Condition Check**: The condition `if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:` is checking if an element is a fixed point in the permutation (i.e., `p[i] = i`). However, the problem specifies that no `p_i` equals `i`, so this condition will never be true.

3. **Output Logic**: The logic for determining the minimum number of invitations is flawed. The program prints 2 if it finds any element `l[j]` such that `l[l[j] - 1] == l[j] - 1`, which is impossible according to the problem constraints. If no such element exists, it prints 3, which might not always be the correct answer.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
