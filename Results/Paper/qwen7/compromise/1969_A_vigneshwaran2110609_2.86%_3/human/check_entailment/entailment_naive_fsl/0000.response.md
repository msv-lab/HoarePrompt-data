Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the cases where no pair of friends are each other's best friends. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
3
2
2 1
```

In this case, there are no friends who are each other's best friends. According to the problem description, Monocarp needs to invite at least 2 friends so that at least 2 friends come to the party. However, the program always prints `2` in the loop, which is incorrect because no friends will come to the party in this scenario. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this input.
