Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `mex` is the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n-2`, `mex` is updated to the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, and `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `p` remain unchanged except for the updated `mex` and `p[i]` based on their definitions.
