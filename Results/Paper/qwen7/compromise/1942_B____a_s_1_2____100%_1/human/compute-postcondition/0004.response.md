Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of length `n` where every element is `-1`.**

The code initializes a list `p` of length `n` filled with `-1`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `a` retains its original state as a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
