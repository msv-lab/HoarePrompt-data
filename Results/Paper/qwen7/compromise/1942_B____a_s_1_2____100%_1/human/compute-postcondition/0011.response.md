Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, `p[i]` is already defined as `mex - a[i]`. Thus, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `mex - a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
