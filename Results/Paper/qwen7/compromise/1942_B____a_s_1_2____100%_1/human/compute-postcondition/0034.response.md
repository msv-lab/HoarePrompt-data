Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be equal to `n`
- `i` is `t - n`, so since `t = n`, `i` will be `n - n = 0`
- `n` remains the same
- `mex` is updated to be the minimum value between its original value and all elements in the list `p`
- `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`
- `a` remains unchanged
- `p` is a list of length `n` where each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`

After the loop completes all its iterations, `t` will be equal to `n`, `i` will be `-1`, `mex` will hold the minimum value among all elements in the list `p`, and `p` will be updated such that each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`.

When the print statement `print(*p)` is executed, it will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

To summarize:
- `t` = `n`
- `i` = `-1`
- `mex` = minimum value in `p`
- `p` = list of length `n` where each element `p[i]` = `mex - a[i]`

Output: **[mex - a[0], mex - a[1], ..., mex - a[n-1]]**
