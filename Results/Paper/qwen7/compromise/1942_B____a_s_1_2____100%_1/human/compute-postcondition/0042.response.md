Output State: **`i` is `n-1`; `mex` is updated to the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`; `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. Since `p[i]` is defined as `mex - a[i]`, the value of `p[i]` does not change directly by this operation. However, `mex` is updated based on the current value of `p[i]`. Therefore, `mex` is now the minimum of its original value and `p[i]`.
