Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `t - 1`, `mex` is the minimum value between `n` and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` except for `p[i]` which is `mex - a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `mex` to be the minimum value between its current value (`n`) and `p[i]`. Since `p[i]` is already set to `mex - a[i]`, `mex` will be updated to `p[i]` if `p[i]` is smaller than `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
