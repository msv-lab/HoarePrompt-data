Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `n`, `mex`, `p`, and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive) in reverse order. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` decreases by 1.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `mex` is updated to the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`
   - `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs in reverse, the next value of `i` will be `n-2`.
   - The loop body updates `mex` and `p[i]` based on the current values of `mex` and `a[i]`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `n-2`.
   - `mex` remains unchanged until the loop body is executed.
   - `p[n-2]` will be updated to `mex - a[n-2]` during the loop body execution.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes:

State: **`i` is `n-2`, `mex` is updated to the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`**
