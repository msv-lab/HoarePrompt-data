Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `mex` is the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`, and `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains `n-3`. The value of `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`, where `p[i]` is defined as `mex - a[i]`. Therefore, `mex` is now the smaller value between its original value and `p[i]`.
