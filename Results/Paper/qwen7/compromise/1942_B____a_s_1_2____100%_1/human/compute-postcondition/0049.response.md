Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be `0`, `mex` will be the minimum value it has taken during all iterations of the loop, and `p` will be a list where each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` for its respective index `i`.

In more detail:
- The loop runs from `i = n-1` down to `i = 0`.
- For each iteration, `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]`.
- Then, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.
- By the end of all iterations, `i` will be `0`, meaning the loop has processed all elements in the list `a`.
- `mex` will hold the smallest value it took during any update throughout the loop.
- Each element in the list `p` will be `mex - a[i]` for the corresponding index `i`.
