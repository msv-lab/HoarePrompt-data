Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `t - 1`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to `n`. It does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `mex`, or `p[i]`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `n` must be at least 1 remains unchanged. The value of `i` is still `t - 1`, and the operations involving `mex` and `p[i]` are not performed until later in the code.
