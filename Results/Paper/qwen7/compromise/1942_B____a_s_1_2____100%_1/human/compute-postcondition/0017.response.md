Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is `0`.
   - `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`.
   - `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop starts from `n-1` and decrements `i` by `1` until it reaches `0`.
   - On the last iteration, `i` will be `0`.
   - `mex` will be updated to be the minimum of itself and `p[0]`.
   - `p[0]` will be `mex - a[0]`.

3. **Final State After Loop**:
   - `i` will be `0` after the loop completes.
   - `mex` will be updated to be the minimum of itself and `p[0]` on the last iteration.
   - `p[0]` will be `mex - a[0]`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement `print(*p)` will print the contents of the list `p`.

Given the above steps, let's describe the final state of `p`:

- Initially, `p` is a list of unknown values.
- During the loop, `p[i]` is updated to `mex - a[i]` for each `i` from `n-1` to `0`.
- On the last iteration (`i = 0`), `p[0]` is set to `mex - a[0]`.
- Since `i` remains `0` after the loop, `p` will have only one element, which is `p[0] = mex - a[0]`.

Therefore, the output will be the single element of the list `p`, which is `mex - a[0]`.

Output: **[mex - a[0]]**
