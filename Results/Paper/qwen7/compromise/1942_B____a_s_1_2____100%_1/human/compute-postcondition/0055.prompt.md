You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [-1] * n
        
        mex = n
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `-1`, `mex` will hold the minimum value among all elements in the list `p`, and `p` will be updated such that each element `p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]` for its respective index `i`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop runs through all test cases (`t` times), the final state of the variables will be:
    #- `i` will be `-1` since the loop decrements `i` from `n-1` to `0` and then stops.
    #- `mex` will be the smallest value found in the list `p` after processing all elements.
    #- The list `p` will contain values such that each `p[i]` equals `mex - a[i]` for its respective index `i`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a single parameter t, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two parameters: n, a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a, a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The function does not return a specific value but processes the input according to the given constraints and performs operations on the list a for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
