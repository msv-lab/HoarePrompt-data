Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is unaffected by the code since no operation involving `t` was performed. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
