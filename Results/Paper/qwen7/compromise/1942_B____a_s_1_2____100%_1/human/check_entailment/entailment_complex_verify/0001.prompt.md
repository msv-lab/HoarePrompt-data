You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [-1] * n
        
        mex = n
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `-1`, `mex` will hold the minimum value among all elements in the list `p`, and `p` will be updated such that each element `p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]` for its respective index `i`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop runs through all test cases (`t` times), the final state of the variables will be:
    #- `i` will be `-1` since the loop decrements `i` from `n-1` to `0` and then stops.
    #- `mex` will be the smallest value found in the list `p` after processing all elements.
    #- The list `p` will contain values such that each `p[i]` equals `mex - a[i]` for its respective index `i`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n and a list of n integers a. It then updates a list p such that each element p[i] is calculated as mex - a[i], where mex is the minimum value found in the updated list p. After processing all test cases, the function prints the updated list p for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly constructs a permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \).

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) of the permutation and the array \( a \).

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes a list `p` of size \( n \) with all elements set to `-1`.
   - It also initializes `mex` (minimum excluded value) to \( n \).

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The loop runs from \( n-1 \) to \( 0 \). For each index \( i \):
     - It sets \( p[i] \) to \( \text{mex} - a[i] \).
     - It updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the newly assigned value of \( p[i] \).

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the constructed permutation \( p \).

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The goal is to ensure that \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
  - By setting \( p[i] = \text{mex} - a[i] \), the program ensures that the MEX condition is satisfied.
  - The use of `mex` to keep track of the smallest unused value in the permutation is crucial.

- **Handling of `mex`:**
  - The `mex` value is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the newly assigned value of \( p[i] \). This ensures that the smallest unused value is correctly tracked.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles all edge cases as specified in the problem statement. It guarantees that at least one valid permutation exists and respects the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
