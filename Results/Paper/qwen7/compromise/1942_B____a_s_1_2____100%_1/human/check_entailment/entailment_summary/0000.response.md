Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by constructing a permutation `p` based on the provided array `a`. However, there are several issues with the logic used in the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `mex`:** The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the upper bound of the values in the permutation. This initialization is problematic because it doesn't correctly reflect the minimum non-negative integer that is missing from the current state of the permutation `p`.

2. **Backward Iteration:** The program iterates backward through the array `a` to calculate the permutation `p`. While this approach might seem logical, it doesn't ensure that the correct `mex` value is being used for each position in `p`.

3. **Updating `mex` Incorrectly:** The `mex` value is updated to be the minimum of itself and the current element of `p`, which is incorrect. The `mex` should be determined based on the values already assigned to `p`, not by comparing with the current element being assigned.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to find a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
