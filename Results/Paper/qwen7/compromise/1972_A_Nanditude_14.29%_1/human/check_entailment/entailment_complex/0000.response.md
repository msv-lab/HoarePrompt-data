Reasoning:
The provided Python program aims to find the minimum number of new problems needed to ensure that for every problem \(i\), the difficulty of the problem \(a_i\) is less than or equal to the expected difficulty \(b_i\). The program iterates through the arrays `a` and `b`, and when it finds that \(b_j < a_i\), it proposes a new problem with difficulty \(b_j\), sorts the array `a` accordingly, and increments the count of new problems. This process continues until all elements in `a` satisfy \(a_i \leq b_i\).

Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:
1. The program initializes the count of new problems (`cnt`) to 0.
2. It uses two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse the arrays `a` and `b`.
3. For each element in `b`, it checks if \(b_j < a_i\).
   - If true, it removes the last element from `a` (to simulate deleting the most difficult problem) and inserts \(b_j\) into the correct position in `a` to maintain the non-decreasing order.
   - It increments the count of new problems and moves to the next element in `b`.
   - If false, it simply moves to the next element in both `a` and `b`.

This approach ensures that the most difficult problem is always removed and replaced with the current expected difficulty when necessary, maintaining the non-decreasing order of difficulties in `a`.

Given the example provided, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of new problems required:
- For the first test case, it needs 2 new problems to make all \(a_i \leq b_i\).
- For the second test case, it needs 3 new problems to make all \(a_i \leq b_i\).

The function `func_1` mentioned in the comments is not used in the main logic of the program and does not affect its correctness.

Therefore, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
