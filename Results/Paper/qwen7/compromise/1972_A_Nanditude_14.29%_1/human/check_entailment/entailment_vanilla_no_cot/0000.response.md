Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the following issues exist:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Insertion**: The program attempts to insert `b[j]` into `a` at position `i`, but this is not the correct approach. According to the problem statement, when a new problem with difficulty `w` is proposed, the most difficult problem (the last element) should be removed, and the array should be re-sorted. However, the current implementation tries to insert `b[j]` at position `i` and then removes the last element, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

2. **Sorting and Removal**: The program uses `sorted(arr, reverse=True)` in the `func_1` function, which sorts the array in descending order. This function is not used in the main logic and does not contribute to solving the problem.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Continuously check if `a[i] <= b[i]`. If not, propose a new problem with difficulty `b[i]` and update the array `a`.
- After proposing a new problem, sort the array `a` and remove the last element.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if a[i] > b[i]:
            a.pop()
            a.append(b[i])
            a.sort()
            cnt += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(cnt)
```

This corrected version ensures that the most difficult problem is removed and a new problem with the required difficulty is added, maintaining the non-decreasing order of the array.
