Output State: **The program returns a list of two lists, where the first list contains n non-decreasing integers representing the difficulties of the initial problems in descending order, and the second list contains n non-decreasing integers representing the maximum expected difficulties in descending order.**

This means that the program sorts both sublists of the input list `arr` in descending order and returns the sorted list. The first sublist will contain the difficulties sorted from highest to lowest, and the second sublist will contain the maximum expected difficulties sorted from highest to lowest.
