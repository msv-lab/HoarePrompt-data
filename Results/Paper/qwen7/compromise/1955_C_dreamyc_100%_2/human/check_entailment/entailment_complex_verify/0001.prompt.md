You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the durability values of the ships (`nums`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to calculate the number of ships sunk.
   - It first checks if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all ship durabilities. If true, it returns `n` because all ships would be sunk.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of attacks on the first and last ships separately using `ceil(k/2)` and `k//2`.

3. **Accumulation of Durabilities**:
   - `s_a` accumulates the durability from the start of the list.
   - `s_b` accumulates the durability from the end of the list.
   - For each ship, it checks if the accumulated durability is less than or equal to the respective number of attacks (`a` and `b`). If true, it increments the count of sunk ships.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the total count of sunk ships.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Sunk Ships Calculation**:
   - The current logic in `func_1` does not accurately simulate the Kraken's attacks. Specifically, it checks if the cumulative durability is less than or equal to the number of attacks, which doesn't reflect the actual sinking process.
   - The program should simulate the attacks in the order specified (first, last, first, etc.) and update the durability accordingly.

2. **Handling of Durability Reduction**:
   - The program does not reduce the durability of ships when they sink. Instead, it just counts them as sunk without updating the list of remaining ships.

### Corrected Approach

To correctly implement the logic, we need to simulate the attacks in the specified order and update the durability of the ships accordingly. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    queue = deque(range(n))  # Use deque to efficiently pop from both ends
    sunk_ships = 0

    while k > 0 and queue:
        if k % 2 == 1:  # Attack the first ship
            if nums[queue[0]] > 0:
                nums[queue[0]] -= 1
                if nums[queue[0]] == 0:
                    sunk_ships += 1
                    queue.popleft()
            k -= 1
        else:  # Attack the last ship
            if nums[queue[-1]] > 0:
                nums[queue[-1]] -= 1
                if nums[queue[-1]] == 0:
                    sunk_ships += 1
                    queue.pop()
            k -= 1

    print(sunk_ships)
```

### Conclusion

The original program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks and does not accurately count the number of sunk ships. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
