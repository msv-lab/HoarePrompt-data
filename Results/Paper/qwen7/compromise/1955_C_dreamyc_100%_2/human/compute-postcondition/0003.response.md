Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^15, `nums` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `a` is the ceiling value of `k / 2`, and `b` is the floor value of `k // 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates two new variables `a` and `b` using the values of `k`. Specifically, `a` is set to the ceiling value of `k / 2`, which means it is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`. Similarly, `b` is set to the floor value of `k // 2`, which is the largest integer less than or equal to `k // 2`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
