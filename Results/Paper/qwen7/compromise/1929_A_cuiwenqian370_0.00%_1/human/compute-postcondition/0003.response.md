Output State: **`arr` is a list of n integers sorted in ascending order; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0; `right` is n - 1.**

Explanation: The variable `right` is assigned the value `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the list `arr`. The other variables (`arr`, `new_arr`, and `left`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
