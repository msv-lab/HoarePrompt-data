### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the logic implemented in the program and verifies it against the provided test cases. Let's break down the key points and ensure the logic aligns with the problem statement:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Conditions for "YES"**:
   - The program checks if `x < k - 1`:
     - If true, it checks if `a >= x + 1`. If so, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
   - If `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 3`. If so, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
   - If `x > k - 1`, it calculates `z` using the formula:
     ```python
     z = 0
     for i in range(x + 1):
         z += z // (k - 1) + 1
     ```
     It then checks if `a >= z`. If so, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Verification Against Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the different scenarios based on the values of `x` and `k`.
   - The calculations for `z` are correct and follow the logic of the problem statement.
   - The program prints "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions, matching the expected outcomes for the given test cases.

Given the detailed analysis and verification, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct and implements the logic as intended.
