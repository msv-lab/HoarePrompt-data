Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic for `x < k - 1` Case**: 
   - The logic checks if `a >= x + 1` but does not account for the fact that Sasha needs to ensure he can recover from losing up to `x` times in a row. This condition alone is insufficient to guarantee that Sasha can achieve any number of coins.

2. **Incorrect Logic for `x == k - 1` Case**:
   - The logic checks if `a >= x + 3`, which is not sufficient. Sasha needs to ensure he can recover from losing `x` times in a row, and the calculation should reflect this.

3. **Incorrect Calculation for `x > k - 1` Case**:
   - The calculation `z = 0; for i in range(x + 1): z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is incorrect. It does not properly simulate the recovery process after losing `x` times in a row. Instead, it should calculate the minimum number of coins required to ensure Sasha can recover from losing `x` times in a row.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to recover from losing x times in a row
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            # Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to recover from losing x times in a row
            z = 0
            for i in range(x + 1):
                z = (z + 1) * (k - 1)
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that Sasha can recover from losing up to `x` times in a row and correctly determines if he can achieve any number of coins.
