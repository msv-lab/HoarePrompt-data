### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key logic in the program and verifies it against the provided test cases. Let's break down the logic and ensure it aligns with the problem statement:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Conditions for "YES"**:
   - If `x < k - 1`, the program checks if `a >= x + 1`. If so, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
   - If `x == k - 1`, the program checks if `a >= x + 3`. If so, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
   - If `x > k - 1`, the program calculates `z` using the formula:
     ```python
     z = 0
     for i in range(x + 1):
         z += z // (k - 1) + 1
     ```
     It then checks if `a >= z`. If so, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Verification Against Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the different scenarios based on the values of `x` and `k`.
   - The calculations for `z` are performed accurately, and the comparisons with `a` are done correctly.

Given the detailed analysis and verification, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the test cases provided.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct.
