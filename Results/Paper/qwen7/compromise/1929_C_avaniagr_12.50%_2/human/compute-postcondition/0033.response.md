Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `x`, `x` remains greater than `k - 1` and at least 2, and `z` will be 2^x - 1.

To explain, the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = x`. Each iteration updates `z` as follows: `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`. Given the pattern observed from the first three iterations, where `z` starts at 0 and grows exponentially, we can deduce that after `x` iterations, `z` will be `2^x - 1`. This is because each iteration roughly doubles the value of `z` due to the integer division and addition operation.
