Postcondition: **Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `x`, `x` must be a non-negative integer, and `z` will be the sum of `z` initialized to 0 plus the value of `z // (k - 1) + 1` added for each iteration from 0 to `x`. Additionally, the value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.**
