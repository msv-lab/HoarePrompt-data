Postcondition: `i` is equal to `x`, `x` is a non-negative integer, and `z` is the sum of `z` initialized to 0 plus the value of `z // (k - 1) + 1` added for each iteration from 0 to `x`. Additionally, the value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z` if the if condition is true, and `a` is less than `z` if the else condition is true.
