Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is greater than `k - 1` and at least 2, `z` is 7**

Explanation: The variable `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Given that `z` is initially 3, and `x` is greater than `k - 1` and at least 2, we can infer that `(k - 1)` is 1 (since `x` is at least 2 and greater than `k - 1`). Therefore, `z // (k - 1)` equals `3 // 1` which is 3, and `3 + 1` equals 4. So, `z` becomes `3 + 4`, which is 7. The other variables remain unchanged.
