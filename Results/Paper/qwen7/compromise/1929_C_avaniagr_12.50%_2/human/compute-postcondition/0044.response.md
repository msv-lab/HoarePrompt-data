Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers inputted from the user, `t` is `t - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `k, x, a = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated inputs from the user and converts them into integers, assigning each to the respective variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as `t - 1`.
