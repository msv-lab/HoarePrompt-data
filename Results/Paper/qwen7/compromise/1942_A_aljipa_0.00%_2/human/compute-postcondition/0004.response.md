Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes two positive integers, `n` and `k`, with constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3 and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3. For each test case, it returns a value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.**
