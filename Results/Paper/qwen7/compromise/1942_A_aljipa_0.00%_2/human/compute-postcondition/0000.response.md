Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), the output state maintains this condition, stating that `t` is now an input integer within the same range.
