Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i`, `r` is the input string from the user and its current value is equal to '<'.**

Explanation: The code `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is `i`) to `v1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `v1` and `v2` both now hold the value `i`, while the other variables retain their initial states.
