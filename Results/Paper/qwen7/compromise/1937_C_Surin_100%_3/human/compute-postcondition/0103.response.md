Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i + 1`, `r` is equal to '<', `v2` is `i`**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. Since no variables are modified or reassigned, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
