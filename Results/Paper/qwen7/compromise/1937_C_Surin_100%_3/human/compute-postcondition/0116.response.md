Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `r` is the input from the user for the last iteration, `v2` is `i` for the last iteration.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `kp` remains 0, `n` is the original input integer which must be greater than 1, `g` remains 0, `v1` will be the last value of `i` which is `n-1`, `r` will be the input received from the user during the last iteration of the loop, and `v2` will be the last value of `i` which is also `n-1`.
