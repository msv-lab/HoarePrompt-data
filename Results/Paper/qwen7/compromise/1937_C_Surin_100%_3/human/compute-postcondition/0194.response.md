Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is the new input integer which is greater than `n-1`, `v2` is 3, `v1` is 2**

Explanation: The code `v2 = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `v2`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `v1` remain unchanged. The condition for `n` being greater than `n-1` is still valid since `n` is an input integer greater than `n-1`.
