Output: **? i i i i**

Explanation:
- `kp` is 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is `i`.
- `v2` is `i`.

Therefore, when the `print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')` statement is executed, it will print the formatted string with the values of `v1` and `v2`, both of which are equal to `i`.
