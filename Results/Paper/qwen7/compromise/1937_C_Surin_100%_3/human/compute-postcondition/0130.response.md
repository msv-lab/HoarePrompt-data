Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is '=', `r2` is an input string**

The code `r2 = input('')` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `r2`. Since no specific value is given for the input, `r2` remains as an input string. The values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
