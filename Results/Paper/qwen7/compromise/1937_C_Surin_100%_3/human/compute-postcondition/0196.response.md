Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is the new input integer which is greater than `n-1`, `v2` is 3, `v1` is 2**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or states. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. Since no variables are modified, their previous values remain unchanged.
