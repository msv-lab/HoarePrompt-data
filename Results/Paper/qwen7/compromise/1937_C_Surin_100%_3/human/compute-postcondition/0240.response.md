Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer, which means it ensures that all pending output is written to the standard output. Since no variables are affected, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
