Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer, the user needs to provide a new input to set the range for the next iteration, `prev` retains its previous value**.

Explanation: The variable `kp` remains unchanged and is still 0. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user, which must be greater than or equal to 3. The condition that the user needs to provide a new input to set the range for the next iteration remains valid. The variable `prev` retains its previous value, meaning it is not altered by the current code snippet.
