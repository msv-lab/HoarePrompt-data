Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The variable `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Initial state before the loop**:
   - `kp` is 0.
   - `n` is the original input integer.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `prev` is 0.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` should be set to 1 (the starting value of the loop).
   - `n` must be greater than 0 because the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`.

5. **Final state after adjusting**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
