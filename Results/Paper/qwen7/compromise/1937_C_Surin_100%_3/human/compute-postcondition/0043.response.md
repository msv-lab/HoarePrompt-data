Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is an input string and its current value is '='**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables. It only ensures that any buffered output is written to the console immediately. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
