Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is the input value from the user, `prev` is 1 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 1 if `r` is '<', no changes made by `sys.stdout.flush()`**.

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call does not change any variable values or add new information. It only ensures that any buffered output is written to the console immediately. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
