Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `r` is an input string**

The code `r = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `r`. Since the initial state of `i` and `n` does not get affected by this line of code, their values remain the same. The variable `r` is now assigned the value of the user's input, which is treated as a string.
