Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `kp` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `i + 1`.
   - `r` is the input from the user.
   - `v2` is `i`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `v1` is `i + 1`.
- `v2` is `i`.

However, the values of `i` are not explicitly provided. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, it could be any integer. But for the purpose of the print statement, we need to express `v1` and `v2` in terms of `i`.

Given:
- `v1 = i + 1`
- `v2 = i`

The print statement will output:
```plaintext
? (i + 1) (i + 1) i i
```

So, the output will be:
Output: **? (i + 1) (i + 1) i i**
