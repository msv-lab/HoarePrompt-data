Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than `n-1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, if the loop is to execute again, `i` must be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than `i`, which means `n` must be greater than 2.

5. **Consider the loop body effects**: The loop body sets `prev` based on the values of `r` and `r2`. However, these changes do not affect the loop condition or the values of `i` and `n`.

Given this analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
