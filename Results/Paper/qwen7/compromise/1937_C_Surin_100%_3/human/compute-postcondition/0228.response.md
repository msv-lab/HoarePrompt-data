Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2 but its exact value is not specified.
- `r` is an input string but its value is not specified.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

Here, `i` is clearly 2, but `prev` is not defined in the initial state. Since `prev` is not defined and no value for it is provided, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the output will include `prev` as is.

Output: **? 2 2 prev prev**
