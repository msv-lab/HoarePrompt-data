Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `r` is the input from the user, `v2` is `i`**.

Explanation: The code `v1 = v2` updates the value of `v1` to be the same as `v2`. Since `v2` is defined as `i`, `v1` is now also `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
