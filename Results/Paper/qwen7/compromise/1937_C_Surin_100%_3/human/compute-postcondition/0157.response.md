Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or conditions. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed data is actually outputted. Since no variables are modified, their initial states remain unchanged.
