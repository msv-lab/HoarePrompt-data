Output State: **i is n, n must be greater than or equal to 3, v2 is n-1, v1 is n-1, prev is 3.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the initial value of `n`. The variable `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 since the loop runs until `i` reaches `n`, and `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration. The variables `v2` and `v1` remain unchanged at `n-1` because they are not modified within the loop. The variable `prev` is set to 3 after the third iteration, as per the given conditions and the loop's behavior.
