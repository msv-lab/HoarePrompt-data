Output State: **`kp` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, and `v2` is `i`.**

Explanation: The code `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Initially, `v2` is equal to `i`. Therefore, after executing the code, `v1` will also be equal to `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
