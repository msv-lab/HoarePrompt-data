Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer greater than `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input()
    if r == '>':
        prev = i
    elif r == '=':
        print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r2 = input('')
        if r2 == '<':
            prev = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than `n-1`. If the current value of `r` is '>', then `prev` is set to 1. If the current value of `r` is '=', and the current value of `r2` is '<', then `prev` is set to 1. Otherwise, `r` remains unchanged and `prev` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, and `r` is an input string. If `r` equals '>', no changes are made. If `r` equals '<', the condition remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, and `r` is an input string. If `r` is equal to '>', no changes are made. If `r` is not equal to '>', `r2` is an input string and the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
