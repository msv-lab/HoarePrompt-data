Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `n`. It flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which is related to how the output is handled but does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
