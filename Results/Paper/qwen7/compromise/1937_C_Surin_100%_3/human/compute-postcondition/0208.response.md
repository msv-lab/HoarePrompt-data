Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than `n-1`, `prev` is 1, and the current value of `r` is equal to '>'**

Explanation: The line `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `n` must be greater than `n-1` (which is true for any positive integer), `prev` is now 1, and the value of `r` remains '>'.
