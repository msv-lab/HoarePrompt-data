Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the original input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have taken on all values from 1 to `n-1`. The last value assigned to `v1` and `v2` inside the loop is `i`, which will be `n-1` when the loop terminates. The other variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
