Output State: **`kp` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n - 1`, `v2` is `i`, and the character `r` is unchanged, being less than or equal to '<'.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered data is written out immediately. However, this operation does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `kp`, `i`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, and the character `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
