Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `r` is an input string, no changes made by `sys.stdout.flush()`**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, or `r`. It only flushes the output buffer, which means it ensures that all pending output is written to the standard output (like the console). Since no new values are assigned to any of the variables, their states remain unchanged.
