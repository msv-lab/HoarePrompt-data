Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer which is greater than `n-1`, `v2` is 1**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or states. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed output is actually displayed. Since no variables are affected, their previous states remain unchanged.
