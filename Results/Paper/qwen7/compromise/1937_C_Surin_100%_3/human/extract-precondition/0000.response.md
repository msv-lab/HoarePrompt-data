Precondition: **None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the provided function signature. However, the problem requires interacting with a hidden permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \), which is a permutation of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\). The function can ask up to \(3n\) queries to compare bitwise OR results and determine the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.**
