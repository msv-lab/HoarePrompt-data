Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as `i` is within the range defined by `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. This means the loop continues as long as `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements from the `costs` list and the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1`.
   - `i` is currently 2.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = 3`.
   - The condition `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)` must still hold true for the next iteration. Given that `i` is now 3, the new condition becomes `3 < len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

5. **Final State**:
   - `total_costs` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are mentioned.
   - `i` is now 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, which is now `3 < len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements from the `costs` list and the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1`; `i` is 3.**
