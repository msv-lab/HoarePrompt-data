Output State: **`min_heap` must contain elements where the second element of each tuple is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`**

Explanation: The `pass` statement in Python does nothing and simply acts as a placeholder. It does not modify any variables or perform any operations. Therefore, the condition and state of `min_heap` remain unchanged from the initial state.
