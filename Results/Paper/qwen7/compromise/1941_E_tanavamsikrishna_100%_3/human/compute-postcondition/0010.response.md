Output State: **`total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements from the `costs` list and the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1`; `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code appends to `total_costs` the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1` in the `costs` list. Given that `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, the new sum added to `total_costs` is the sum of elements from index 2 to `2 + k - 1` (which is `2 + k - 1`). After appending this sum to `total_costs`, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The condition `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)` must still hold true for the next iteration.
