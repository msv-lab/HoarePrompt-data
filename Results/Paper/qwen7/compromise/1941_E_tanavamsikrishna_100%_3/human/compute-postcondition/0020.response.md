Output State: **`i` is `d-1`, `d` must be greater than 1, `len(row)` must be greater than `d-1`, and `min_heap` must be empty; `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `row[i]` to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`. Here, `i` is `d-1`, and since the loop has terminated due to `min_heap` being empty, `i` does not change. The value of `d` and `len(row)` remains the same as they were initially or previously. The `min_heap` remains empty as it was emptied during the loop iterations. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `row[i]`.
