Output State: **`i` is `d-1`, `d` must be greater than 1, `len(row)` must be greater than `d-1`, and `min_heap` contains the tuple `(e[0], 0)`.**

Explanation: The code `heappush(min_heap, e)` pushes the tuple `e` onto the `min_heap`. Since `e` is not specified in terms of its components, we assume it is a tuple where the first element is `e[0]` and the second element is `0` (common in heap operations). The other variables remain unchanged.
