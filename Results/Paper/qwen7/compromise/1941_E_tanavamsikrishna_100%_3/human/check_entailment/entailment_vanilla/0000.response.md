Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes a single row of the river to calculate the minimal cost of installing supports.
   - It initializes the first `d` elements of the row with a cost of `1`, `2`, ..., `d`.
   - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of supports up to a distance `d` from the current position.
   - For each subsequent element in the row, it updates the cost based on the minimum cost found in the heap and ensures the distance constraint is met.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for a test case.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to get the minimal cost of installing supports for that row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing the costs of the selected rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of `k` consecutive rows.

### Detailed Verification

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Initialization**: The first `d` elements are initialized to ensure they meet the distance constraint with the first and last supports.
- **Heap Usage**: The min-heap helps efficiently find the minimum cost of supports within the required distance `d`.
- **Cost Calculation**: Each element is updated based on the minimum cost found in the heap, ensuring the distance constraint is maintained.

This function seems to correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimal cost for a single row.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Input Reading**: Reads the dimensions and the river grid correctly.
- **Cost Calculation per Row**: Uses `func_1` to compute the minimal cost for each row.
- **Total Cost Calculation**: Computes the total cost for placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows.
- **Minimum Total Cost**: Finds the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of `k` consecutive rows.

This function also appears to correctly implement the logic for the entire problem.

### Edge Cases and Constraints
- The constraints are handled appropriately, and the solution should work within the given limits.
- The use of a min-heap ensures efficient computation even for large grids.

### Conclusion
Given the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
