### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- **Purpose**: Calculate the minimum cost to place supports in a single row such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
- **Logic**:
  - Initialize the first support at the first cell (`row[0] = 1`).
  - For the next `d-1` cells, set the cost to `row[i] + 2` (since the cost of the first support is already 1, and we add 1 for each additional support).
  - Use a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost for placing supports up to the current index.
  - For each subsequent cell, remove the oldest support from the heap if it is too far away (more than `d` cells away).
  - Add the current cell's cost plus the cost of the previous support to the heap.
  - Return the cost of the last support.

This function seems to be attempting to place supports optimally within the constraints, but there are a few issues:
- The initialization of the first support is correct.
- The handling of the first `d` cells is also correct.
- However, the main loop logic might not correctly handle the distance constraint after the initial `d` cells. Specifically, it does not ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- **Purpose**: Calculate the total minimum cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.
- **Logic**:
  - Read the input parameters and the river depths.
  - For each row, calculate the minimum cost using `func_1`.
  - Sum the costs of the `k` consecutive rows with the minimum cost.
  - Print the minimum sum of these costs.

This function seems to be correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1` and then finds the minimum cost among all possible `k` consecutive rows.

#### Correctness of the Overall Program:
- The program reads the input correctly and processes each row to find the minimum cost of placing supports.
- It then finds the minimum cost among all possible `k` consecutive rows.
- The function `func_1` has some issues with the main loop logic, but the overall approach of the program is sound.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The `func_1` function does not correctly handle the distance constraint after the initial `d` cells, leading to potential incorrect results. However, the overall structure of the program is correct in terms of solving the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is not entirely correct due to the issues in the `func_1` function, even though the overall approach is sound.
