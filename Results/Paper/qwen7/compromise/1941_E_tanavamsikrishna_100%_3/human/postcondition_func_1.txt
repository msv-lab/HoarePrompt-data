The function accepts four integers \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and \( d \), along with a list of \( n \) lists called `rows`. Each inner list in `rows` contains \( m \) positive integers representing the depths of river cells, with the first and last elements being 0. The function calculates the sum of every consecutive \( k \) elements from a list of costs derived from `rows`, and then prints the minimum of these sums.
