Postcondition: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers converted from the strings in the original list, `l` is an integer within the range `[0, n-1]`, `r` is an integer within the range `[0, n-1]`, `ans` is either `1` or `2`, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, and `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `l` is `1`, `r` is `n - 2`, the first element of `a` is `0`, and the current value of `a[r]` is `0` if `a[r]` was `0`; otherwise, the value of `a[r]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `l` remains `0`, `r` remains `n - 1`, `ans` is `1`, and `t` is `k % 2`.
