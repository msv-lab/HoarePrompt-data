Postcondition: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` are each decreased by `mi`, `a[1]` is set to 0, and `a[n - 2]` is set to 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and `t` is `k % 2`.**
