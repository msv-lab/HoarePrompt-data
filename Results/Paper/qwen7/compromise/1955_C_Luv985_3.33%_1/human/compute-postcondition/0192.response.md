Postcondition: `T` is decremented by 1, `ans` is 1, `t` is `k % 2`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, the list `a` is now a list of integers, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `k` is greater than 0, and `mi * 2 > k`. This is because if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is set to 1; otherwise, no changes occur since there is no else part.
