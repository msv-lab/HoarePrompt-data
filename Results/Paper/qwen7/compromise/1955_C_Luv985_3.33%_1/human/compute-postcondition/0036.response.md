Postcondition: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is set to 1. There is no else part in the code.**
