Postcondition: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is adjusted according to the condition (either `k - 2 * mi` or `k % 2`), `a` is a list of integers where specific elements may be reduced by `mi` under certain conditions, `l` is either 1 or 0, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `ans` is either 1 or 2 with a possible increment of 1, `mi` is now `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, and `t` is `k % 2` if the else part is executed.**
