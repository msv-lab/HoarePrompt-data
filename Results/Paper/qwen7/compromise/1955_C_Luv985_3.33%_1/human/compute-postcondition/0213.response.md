Postcondition: `T` is decremented by 1, `ans` can be 2, 3, or 4, `t` holds the value of `k % 2` at the last iteration, `l` can be 0 or 1, `r` can be `n - 2` or `n - 1`, the list `a` is updated such that `a[0]` is 0 and `a[n-1]` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `k` is decremented by either 0 or `0 * 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
