Postcondition: `T` is decremented by 1, `ans` is 0, `t` holds the value of `k % 2` at the last iteration, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, the list `a` is now a list of integers, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `k` must be greater than 0, and the minimum value of `mi` is less than or equal to half of `k`.
