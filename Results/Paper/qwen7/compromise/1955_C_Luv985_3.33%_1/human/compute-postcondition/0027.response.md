Postcondition: `T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, and the current value of `a[l]` is 0. If the current value of `a[r]` is 0, then `ans` remains 2.
