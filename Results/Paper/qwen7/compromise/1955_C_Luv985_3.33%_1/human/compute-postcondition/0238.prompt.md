Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, while `n`, `k`, and `a` remain undefined.
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` is greater than 1, `k` is less than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is 1, `ans` is either 2, 3, or 4, `mi` is now `min(a[l], a[r])`, and `t` is `k % 2`, `ans` is increased by 1 if `k >= a[l]`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `ans` is incremented by `k >= a[l]`, `t` holds the value of `k % 2` at the last iteration, `l` is equal to `r`, the list `a` has been modified such that elements at indices `l` and `r` have been reduced by their minimum value `mi` as many times as possible without violating the conditions of the loop, and `k` is non-negative and has been fully utilized as per the operations inside the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `T` is decremented by 1, `ans` is either 3 or 4, `t` holds the value of `k % 2` from the last iteration, `l` is `r`, `r` is `n - 3` or `n - 2` depending on the initial condition, `k` is less than or equal to 0, the list `a` is updated such that `a[0]` is 0 and `a[n-1]` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
