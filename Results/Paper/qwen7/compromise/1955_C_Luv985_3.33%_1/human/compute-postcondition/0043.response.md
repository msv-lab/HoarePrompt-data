Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `mi` is now `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by `2 * mi`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `mi` remains `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, and `a[l]` and `a[r]` are still reduced by `mi`.
