Postcondition: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, the current value of `a[l]` is 0, and the current value of `a[r]` is 0.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes. If `a[r]` equals 0, the conditions specified in the if part apply, resulting in `r` being reduced by 1 (making it `n - 2`), `ans` being set to 2, and ensuring `a[r]` is 0. If `a[r]` does not equal 0, the else part does not change the conditions, so the same postcondition as the if part applies.
