Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `l` must be less than `r`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code reduces the value of `a[r]` by `mi`, where `mi` is defined as the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
