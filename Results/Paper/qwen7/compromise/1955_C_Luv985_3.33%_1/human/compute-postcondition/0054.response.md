Postcondition: `T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than `2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `mi` is now `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, `t` is `k % 2`, if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is `ans + 1`.
