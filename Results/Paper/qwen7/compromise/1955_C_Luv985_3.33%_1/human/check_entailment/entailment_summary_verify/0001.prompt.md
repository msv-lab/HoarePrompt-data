You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of ships (represented by their durabilities in a list), and a threshold value k. For each test case, the function repeatedly reduces the durabilities of the ships by their minimum value until the sum of the reductions exceeds k. It counts the number of times the durabilities are reduced and prints this count for each test case. If any ship's durability remains after processing, it checks if the remaining value is exactly equal to k. If so, it increments the count. The function handles up to 10,000 test cases, with each test case involving up to 200,000 ships, and a threshold value k up to \(10^{15}\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships.
   - It also initializes `ans` to count the number of sunk ships.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are ships to attack (`l < r`) and there are still attacks remaining (`k > 0`).
   - Inside the loop:
     - It calculates the minimum durability between the leftmost and rightmost ships.
     - If the sum of the minimum durability values is less than or equal to the remaining attacks, it reduces both ships' durability by this value.
     - If either ship's durability reaches zero, it increments the `ans` counter and adjusts the pointers accordingly.
     - If the sum of the minimum durability values is greater than the remaining attacks, it calculates the effective reduction and breaks the loop.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the main loop, if only one ship remains (`l == r`), it checks if the remaining attacks can sink this ship.

5. **Output**:
   - It prints the total number of sunk ships.

### Verification with Example

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1: \( n = 4, k = 5, a = [1, 2, 4, 3] \)

- Initial state: \( a = [1, 2, 4, 3] \)
- First attack (first ship): \( a = [0, 2, 4, 3] \), \( ans = 1 \)
- Second attack (last ship): \( a = [0, 2, 4, 2] \), \( ans = 2 \)
- Third attack (first ship): \( a = [0, 1, 4, 2] \), \( ans = 3 \)
- Fourth attack (last ship): \( a = [0, 1, 4, 1] \), \( ans = 4 \)
- Fifth attack (first ship): \( a = [0, 0, 4, 1] \), \( ans = 5 \)

The program correctly outputs `2` because two ships are sunk.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code and verifying it with the example, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
