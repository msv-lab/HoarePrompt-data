Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is now the last element of the original list `a`.
- `mexsize` has been incremented for each occurrence where `sz` equals `mexsize`.
- `a` is now an empty list.
- `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.

We need to determine the value of `mexsize` to decide the output of the `print` statement.

Given that `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, let's consider the expression `mexsize % 2 == 0`:

- If `mexsize` is even, the condition `mexsize % 2 == 0` evaluates to `True`.
- If `mexsize` is odd, the condition `mexsize % 2 == 0` evaluates to `False`.

Since `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, it must be an integer value. Without knowing the exact value of `maxsize`, we can still determine the output based on the parity of `mexsize`.

Therefore, the output will depend on whether `mexsize` is even or odd. If `mexsize` is even, "Alice" will be printed; if `mexsize` is odd, "Bob" will be printed.

Output: **Alice if mexsize is even, otherwise Bob**
