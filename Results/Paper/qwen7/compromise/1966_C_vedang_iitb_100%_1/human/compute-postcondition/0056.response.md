Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with all elements processed, `mexsize` is updated to the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `t` remains unchanged, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a` before any elements were potentially incremented within the loop, if the current value of `mexsize` is greater than the current value of `maxsize`, then `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`; otherwise, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
