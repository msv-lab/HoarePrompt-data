Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable in the given code is `sz`, which iterates over the elements of the list `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a` to iterate over.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is a list containing at least one element.
   - `sz` is the first element in the list `a`.
   - If `sz` equals `mexsize + 1`, no changes are made; otherwise, the condition remains as initially stated.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `sz` is the current element being processed in the loop, it will be updated to the next element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` will lose its first element after the current iteration.

Given these points, let's determine the new state:

- The list `a` will now contain all elements except the first one (since `sz` was the first element).
- The new value of `sz` will be the second element in the original list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a list containing at least one element (excluding the first element), `sz` is the second element in the original list `a`**.
