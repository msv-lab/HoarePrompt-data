Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)**.

This means that `t` has been assigned the value of an integer input, which is within the specified range of 1 to 10^4. The other conditions and constraints remain unchanged, specifically, the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2â‹…10^5, and the list of integers `a` and its properties are still valid for each test case.
