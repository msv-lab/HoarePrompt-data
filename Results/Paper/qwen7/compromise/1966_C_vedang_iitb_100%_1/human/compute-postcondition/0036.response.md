Output State: **`a` contains at least one element, `sz` is the first element in the list `a`, and the current value of `sz` is equal to `mexsize + 1`.**

Explanation: The code increments `mexsize` by 1. Initially, `sz` was equal to `mexsize`. After executing `mexsize = mexsize + 1`, `sz` now equals `mexsize + 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
