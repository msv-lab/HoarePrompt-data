Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, and `maxsize` remain unchanged. The list `a` is updated to be its sorted version.
