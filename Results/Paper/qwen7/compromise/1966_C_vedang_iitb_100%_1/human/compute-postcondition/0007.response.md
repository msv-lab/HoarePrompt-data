Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `sz`, which iterates over the list `a`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. This ensures that there is something to iterate over.

3. **List the required states**: Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are related to the list `a`. Specifically, `a` must have at least one element.

4. **Consider other given states**: The states `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is 1. These states are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state after adjustment should reflect that the list `a` must have at least one element.

**State: **`a` must have at least one element**
