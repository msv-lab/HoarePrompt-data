Output State: **`is_already_stairs` is True, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, and `res` is a list that will store the results of the operations performed.**

The code simply assigns `True` to the variable `is_already_stairs`. This does not affect the values of `arr`, `start_index`, or `res`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
