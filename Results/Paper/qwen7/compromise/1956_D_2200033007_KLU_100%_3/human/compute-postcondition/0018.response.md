Output State: **`is_already_stairs` is False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, `res` is a list, and `i` is equal to 0.**

Explanation: The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called with `i - 1` as an argument. Since `i` is not equal to 0, `i - 1` will be a positive integer. However, the function call itself does not change the values of the variables `is_already_stairs`, `arr`, `start_index`, `res`, or `i`. After the function call, `i` will be decremented by 1, making it equal to 0. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
