Output State: **`is_already_stairs` is False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is equal to 0.**

Explanation: The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called with `i - 1` as an argument. Since `i` is not equal to 0 initially, `i - 1` will be a positive integer. However, the exact value of `i` is not specified, but we know that after the call to `make_stairs(i - 1)`, the value of `i` will be reduced by 1. Given the condition that `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, and since `i` is now 0 (as it was decremented by 1), the condition `arr[start_index + 0]` is true, meaning the value at `arr[start_index]` should be 0. However, since no other variables are directly modified by the function call and the function itself does not return any value, the only change is in the value of `i`. Therefore, `i` is now 0.
