The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, which define a sublist within a given list `arr`. It returns the maximum value among several computations involving sublists of `arr`. These computations include evaluating the sum of values from recursively solving subproblems and considering boundary elements. The function uses memoization through a dictionary `res_dict` to store and reuse previously computed results for subproblems. If the result for the key `(start_index, end_index)` is already in `res_dict`, it returns that value. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum value by iterating over possible splits within the sublist and combining results from recursive calls.
