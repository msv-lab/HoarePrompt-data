Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements of the array by performing a specific operation no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) times. However, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` do not seem to implement the required logic for finding the optimal operations to maximize the sum.

The main issues are:
1. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` appear to be attempting to solve a different problem related to partitioning the array into subarrays and calculating their sums, but they do not directly address the problem of maximizing the sum through the allowed operations.
2. There is no clear implementation of the logic to choose the optimal subarray to modify in each operation to maximize the sum.
3. The `make_stairs` function seems to be an attempt to create a staircase pattern in the array, but it is not clear how this relates to the problem of maximizing the sum.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem described. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
