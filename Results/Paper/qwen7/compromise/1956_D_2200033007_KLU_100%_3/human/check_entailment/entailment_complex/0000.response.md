### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine if it meets the problem requirements.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array elements using up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
   - Each operation sets a contiguous subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.
   - The goal is to find the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function computes the maximum sum achievable for a subarray defined by `start_index` and `end_index`.
   - It uses memoization (`res_dict`) to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The function considers splitting the subarray into smaller parts and recursively computing the maximum sum.
   - The base case handles single-element subarrays.
   - The function correctly computes the maximum sum by exploring all possible splits and boundary adjustments.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function determines the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It checks if the entire subarray can be set to a single value (i.e., the MEX value).
   - If the maximum value equals the square of the subarray length, it directly returns the full subarray.
   - Otherwise, it recursively finds the optimal splits and updates the operations list.
   - The function correctly identifies the necessary operations to maximize the sum.

4. **Function `make_stairs` Analysis**:
   - This function constructs a "stair" pattern in the array to ensure the MEX value is applied correctly.
   - It modifies the array segments to achieve the desired MEX value.
   - The function ensures that the array segments are set to the appropriate values to maximize the sum.
   - The function correctly updates the array and the operations list.

5. **Main Program Flow**:
   - The main program calls `func_1` to get the maximum sum.
   - It then calls `func_2` to get the sequence of operations.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

Given the detailed analysis, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` collectively ensure that the array is manipulated to achieve the maximum sum while adhering to the constraints and problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements and construct the sequence of operations. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
