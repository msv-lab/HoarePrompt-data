Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, which define a sublist within a given list `arr`. It returns the maximum value among several computations involving sublists of `arr`. These computations include evaluating the sum of values from recursively solving subproblems and considering boundary elements. The function uses memoization through a dictionary `res_dict` to store and reuse previously computed results for subproblems. If the result for the key `(start_index, end_index)` is already in `res_dict`, it returns that value. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum value by iterating over possible splits within the sublist and combining results from recursive calls.
Function number 2 :

            return func_2(start_index, end_index - 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` takes two parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, and returns a list based on certain conditions. If the length of the sublist from `start_index` to `end_index` is 1 and the element at `start_index` is 0, it returns an empty list. If the maximum value in the sublist equals the square of its length, it returns a list containing the tuple `(start_index, end_index)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with adjusted `start_index` and `end_index` values based on conditions involving the elements of the sublist and the result of another function `func_1`. The function ultimately returns one of five possible outcomes: an empty list, a list containing a single tuple `(0, 0)`, a list containing a tuple `(start_index, end_index)`, the result of a recursive call with `start_index + 1` and `end_index`, or the result of a recursive call with `start_index` and `end_index - 1`.
Function number 3 :

 '''
def make_stairs(i: int) -> None:
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:

    if is_already_stairs:
        return
    if i == 0:
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
    if arr[start_index + i] == i:
        make_stairs(i - 1)

            arr[j] = i
        make_stairs(i - 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `make_stairs` accepts a parameter `i` and modifies the list `arr` to form a "stair" pattern starting from index `start_index`. It also appends tuples to the list `res` indicating the range of indices modified. If `arr` already forms a valid stair pattern, it does nothing. The function ultimately ensures that each segment of `arr` from `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) is set to the value `i`, and updates `res` accordingly. The function returns `None`.
