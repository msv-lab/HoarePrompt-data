### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided code and the original assessment step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

#### Function `func_1`
1. **Recursive Approach**: The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum sum of subarrays using a recursive approach. However, the current implementation is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the MEX operation and the subsequent updates to the array elements.
2. **Base Case**: The base case `if start_index == end_index:` returns `max(1, arr[start_index])`, which is not relevant to the problem since we want to maximize the sum, and setting the element to 1 might not be optimal.
3. **Recursive Case**: The recursive case is trying to find the maximum sum by considering different splits of the array, but it does not account for the MEX operation correctly. The current implementation does not update the array elements to their MEX values, which is crucial for maximizing the sum.
4. **Memoization**: The memoization dictionary `res_dict` is used, but the logic inside the function does not correctly update the array elements to their MEX values, making the memoization ineffective.

#### Function `func_2`
1. **Max Value Calculation**: The function `func_2` calculates the maximum value (`max_value`) using `func_1`, which is already flawed as explained above.
2. **Operation Generation**: The function tries to generate operations based on the maximum value, but it does not correctly handle the MEX operation. It attempts to create "staircases" of increasing values, but this approach is overly complex and does not guarantee the correct solution.
3. **Recursive Calls**: The recursive calls in `func_2` do not correctly reflect the MEX operation and the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.

#### Function `make_stairs`
1. **Staircase Pattern**: The function `make_stairs` is intended to create a staircase pattern in the array, but it is not used correctly within the context of the problem. It does not align with the requirement to maximize the sum by performing the MEX operation on subarrays.

### Re-evaluation Based on Annotations

From the annotations, we can see that:
- `func_1` is supposed to use memoization to find the maximum sum of subarrays, but it does not correctly update the array elements to their MEX values.
- `func_2` is supposed to generate the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum, but it does not correctly handle the MEX operation.
- `make_stairs` is intended to create a staircase pattern, but it is not used correctly.

### Correct Implementation

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Identify the MEX value for any subarray.
2. Update the subarray to the MEX value.
3. Ensure the sum is maximized by performing the operations no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) times.

A correct approach would involve:
- Iteratively finding the MEX value for the current subarray.
- Updating the subarray to the MEX value.
- Keeping track of the operations performed.

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis and the annotations, the provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
