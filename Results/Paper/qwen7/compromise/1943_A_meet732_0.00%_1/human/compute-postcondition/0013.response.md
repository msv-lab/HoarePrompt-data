Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
- `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is equal to the count of occurrences of the index value (i.e., `i`) in the list `a`. The first element of `cntl` is 0.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(0)
```

The `print(0)` statement directly prints the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
