Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of `j` is 4. The variable `c` is 0.**

Explanation: Given that the loop breaks when either `cntl[j]` is less than 2 and `c` becomes 0, or when `j` equals `n` (which is implied to be 4 based on the provided information), and since the loop has already executed up to `j = 3` with `c` being 0, it will continue to the next iteration (`j = 4`). At `j = 4`, the condition `if not c or j == n:` will be met because `c` is 0, causing the loop to break and print `j`, which is 4. Thus, after all iterations, `j` will be 4 and `c` will remain 0.
