Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `j` and the condition `range(1, n + 1)`. This means the loop will iterate over values of `j` from 1 to `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 2.
   - `cntl[2]` is less than 2.
   - The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - `c` is 1.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `j`**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` would be 3.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be within the range `1` to `n`.
   - Given that `j` is currently 2, it is within the range, and the loop will continue until `j` reaches `n`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 3.
   - `cntl[2]` remains unchanged as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - The program breaks out of the loop if `cntl[2]` is less than 2, but since we are only adjusting the state for the next iteration, we assume the loop continues unless explicitly stated otherwise.
   - `c` remains 1 as it is not modified inside the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 3, `cntl[2]` is less than 2, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `c` is 1**.
