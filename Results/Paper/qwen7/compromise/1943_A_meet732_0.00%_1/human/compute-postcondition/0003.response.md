Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer; `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `cntl` with `n + 1` elements, each set to 0. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `a` remains as the list of integers obtained from the input string.
