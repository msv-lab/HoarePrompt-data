Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in a:`. This means the loop variable is `i` and the iterable is `a`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop increments `cntl[i]` by 1 for each element `i` in the list `a`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is taken from the list `a`, the value of `i` changes with each iteration.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was the last element processed from `a`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` remains the same as it was at the start of the previous iteration because the loop does not modify `a`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - The value of `i` will change to the next element in `a`.
   - The list `a` remains unchanged.
   - The variable `cntl` will have its corresponding index incremented by 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1 where `i` is the next element in the list `a`**.

To be more specific, if the previous `i` was the last element in the list, the next `i` will be the first element of the list (if it hasn't been exhausted yet).

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1 where `i` is the first element in the list `a`**.
