Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is equal to the count of occurrences of the index value (i.e., `i`) in the list `a`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the `cntl` list will contain the count of how many times each index value (from 0 to `n`) appears in the list `a`. The loop iterates over each element in `a`, and for each element `i`, it increments `cntl[i]` by 1. This means that by the end of the loop, `cntl[i]` will hold the frequency of the integer `i` in the list `a`.
