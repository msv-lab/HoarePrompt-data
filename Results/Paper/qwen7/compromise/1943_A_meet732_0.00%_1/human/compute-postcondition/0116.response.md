Postcondition: `cntl[0]` is the frequency of the integer 0 in the list `a`, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0] - 1`, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2. Additionally, either `c` is not True or `j` equals `n`. In either case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
