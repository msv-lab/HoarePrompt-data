Output State: **`n` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.**

Explanation: The value of `c` is decremented by 1, changing its value from whatever it was initially to `c - 1`. However, since the initial state only specifies that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and does not specify the exact value of `c`, we only update `n` to reflect the decrement operation. The condition on `cntl[j]` remains unchanged as the code snippet does not affect `cntl[j]`.
