Output State: `cntl[i]` is equal to the number of times the element `i` appears in the list `a`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is a new positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element is 0, and after executing the loop, each element `cntl[i]` in the list `cntl` represents the count of how many times the index `i` appears in the list `a`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `cntl` will contain the count of each integer found in the list `a`. Each position `i` in `cntl` will hold the number of times `i` appears in `a`.
