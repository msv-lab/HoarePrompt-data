Postcondition: **`cntl[0]` is 0, `cntl[i]` is equal to the number of times the element `i` appears in the list `a`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is a new positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers, and each element `cntl[i]` in the list `cntl` represents the count of how many times the index `i` appears in the list `a` after all iterations of the loop have finished.**
