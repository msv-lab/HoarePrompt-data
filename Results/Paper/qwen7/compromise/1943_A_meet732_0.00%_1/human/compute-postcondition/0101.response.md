Output State: The value of `cntl[i]` for each index `i` in the list `a` is incremented by the number of times the element `i` appears in the list `a`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `cntl` will have been incremented for each element in the list `a` according to how many times that element appears in `a`. For example, if the number `5` appears 3 times in the list `a`, then `cntl[5]` will be incremented by 3. This process is repeated for every element in `a`, resulting in a final `cntl` list where each index reflects the count of occurrences of that index in the original list `a`.
