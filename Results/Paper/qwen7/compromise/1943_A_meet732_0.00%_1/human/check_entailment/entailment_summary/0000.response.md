Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of each integer in the array `a` and then determining the minimum excludant (MEX) of the resulting array `c`. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Alice's and Bob's Moves**: The program does not simulate the alternating moves between Alice and Bob as described in the problem statement. Instead, it directly calculates the MEX based on the counts of elements in `a`.

2. **Logic for Calculating MEX**: The program incorrectly calculates the MEX. It assumes that Alice will always pick the smallest available element first, and Bob will pick any remaining element. This is not necessarily true because both players play optimally.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The program does not handle edge cases where the optimal strategy might involve different choices than simply counting the occurrences.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly simulate the game and determine the optimal MEX as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
