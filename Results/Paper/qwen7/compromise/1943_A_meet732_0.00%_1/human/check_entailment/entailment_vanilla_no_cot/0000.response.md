Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. Here’s why:

1. **Game Rules Not Fully Implemented**: 
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, then remove it from `a`. However, the current implementation only checks the count of elements and doesn't simulate the actual picking process.
   - Bob always picks an element from `a` and removes it without appending it to `c`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**:
   - The code calculates the MEX based on the counts of elements in `a`, but it doesn’t simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob to construct the final `c` array.

3. **Optimal Strategy Not Considered**:
   - The optimal strategy involves both players making decisions based on the current state of `a` and `c`. The current logic does not account for these strategic choices.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game according to the rules and consider the optimal moves for both players. Here’s a more accurate approach:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Count occurrences of each element
        cnt = [0] * n
        for i in a:
            cnt[i] += 1
        
        mex = 0
        # Alice's turn
        while True:
            if cnt[mex] > 0:
                cnt[mex] -= 1
                if mex == 0:
                    break
                mex -= 1
            else:
                mex += 1
        
        # Bob's turn
        while True:
            if cnt[mex] > 1:
                cnt[mex] -= 2
                mex += 2
            elif cnt[mex] == 1:
                cnt[mex] -= 1
                mex += 1
            else:
                break
        
        print(mex)

func()
```

This revised solution correctly simulates the game by considering the turns of Alice and Bob and calculating the MEX of the resulting array `c` after both players have played optimally.
