Output State: **`ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is now `n / 2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1` to its current value. Given that `g` is `n / 2 - 1`, the expression `g / count + 1` simplifies to `(n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`. Therefore, `ans` becomes `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
