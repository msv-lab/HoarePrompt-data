Output State: **`ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is 3, `countmins` is 2, `g` is now `n / 2 - 1`**

Explanation: The value of `countmins` is updated to `count - 1`, which means `countmins` is now 2. All other variables retain their original values from the initial state.
