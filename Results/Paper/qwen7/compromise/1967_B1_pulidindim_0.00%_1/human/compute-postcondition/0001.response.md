Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each value of `i` in the range from `0` to `t-1`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
   - `n` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
   - The precondition that the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^6\) remains valid.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop depends on `t` being greater than 0, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.
   - The values of `n` and `m` do not affect the loop condition directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
