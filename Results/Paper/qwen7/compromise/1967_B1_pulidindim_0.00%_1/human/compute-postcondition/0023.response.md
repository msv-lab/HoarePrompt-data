Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` must be at least 3, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n` + 1, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n` / 2 - 1, and if `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins` (which is 1), so `g` becomes `n / 2 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
