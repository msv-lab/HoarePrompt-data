Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` must be at least 3, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n` + 1, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n` / 2**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `g` to be `n / count`. Since `count` is 2, `g` becomes `n / 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
