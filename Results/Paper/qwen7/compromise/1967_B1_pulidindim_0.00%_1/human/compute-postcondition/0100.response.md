Output State: **`ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (g / count + 1)`, `m` must be greater than 4, `count` is 3, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `n / 3 - 2`, `g` is now `n / 3 - 2`**

Explanation: The code `g = n / count` updates the value of `g` to `n / 3` since `count` is 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
