Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n` + `n` / 4 / 2 - 1 / 4 + (`n` / 4 - 1) / 4 + 1 + `g` / 5 + 1, `countmins` is 4, `g` is `n` / 5 - 1**.

Explanation: The value of `count` is explicitly set to 2, overriding its previous value of 7. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
