### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the given code. Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to confirm these findings and ensure we have a correct implementation.

#### Problem Recap
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment
1. **Initialization of `ans`:**
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `n`, which incorrectly assumes all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid. This is not correct because the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) must be checked for all pairs.

2. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop iterates over possible values of `b` starting from 2 up to `m`.
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs. Specifically, the calculation of `g` and its use in updating `ans` does not follow the required condition.

3. **Handling GCD:**
   - The code does not explicitly handle the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not properly addressed.

#### Correct Implementation
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition for each pair. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

#### Annotated Code Explanation
1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of valid pairs.

3. **Nested Loops:**
   - Iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
   - For each `b`, iterate over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n`.
   - Check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - If the condition is satisfied, increment the count.

4. **Output:**
   - Print the count of valid pairs for each test case.

This approach ensures that we correctly count all valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

### Final Evaluation
Based on the corrected implementation and the analysis, the original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the given code. The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

**Final: False**
