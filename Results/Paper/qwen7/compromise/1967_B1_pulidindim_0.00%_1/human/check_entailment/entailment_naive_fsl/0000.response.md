Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) based on a flawed algorithm. 

The core issue lies in the way the program calculates the number of valid pairs. The algorithm iterates through possible values of `count` and attempts to increment the count based on certain conditions, but it does not properly account for the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To illustrate, consider the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):

- The program should output 14 valid pairs, but it does not correctly compute this.

Here are a few specific issues:
1. The calculation of `g` and its subsequent use in updating `ans` does not accurately reflect the problem's constraints.
2. The loop condition and the way `count` is incremented do not properly handle all valid pairs.

A correct solution would involve iterating through all possible pairs (a, b) and checking if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done more accurately using a nested loop to check each pair individually.
