Output State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `x` is at least 16, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value -1, `i` is 5**.

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. The other variables (`mx`, `t`, `x`, `subseq_lens`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
