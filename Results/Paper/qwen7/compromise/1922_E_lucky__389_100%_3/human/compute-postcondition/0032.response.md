Output State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` must be at least 8, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `i` is 4**.

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables (`mx`, `t`, `x`, `subseq_lens`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
