Output State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is at least 16, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value `i - 1`, `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\), `x` is reduced by \(2^{(i-1)}\)**.

Explanation: The value of `x` is decreased by \(2^{(i-1)}\), where `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\). The other variables remain unchanged.
