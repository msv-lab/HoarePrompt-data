Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of 0 and -1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `x` is at least 16, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value -1, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 2, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 3. The values of `mx`, `t`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and the condition on `t` remain unchanged.
