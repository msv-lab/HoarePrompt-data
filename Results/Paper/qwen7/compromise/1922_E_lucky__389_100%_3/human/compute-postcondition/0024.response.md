Postcondition: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer and \(x \geq 2\) and \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq 2\), `subseq_lens` is an empty list, and `i` is 0 if `i == 0`, otherwise `i` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `x` and `subseq_lens` contains `[i - 1]`**.
