Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the object `ansv`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is given as `i` is `len(subseq_lens) + 1`. However, since the loop starts from `0` and goes up to `len(ansv) - 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is within this range.

3. **Determine the State of `ansv`**: The variable `ansv` is mentioned to have three additional elements which are `subseq_lens[1]`, `subseq_lens[2]`, and `subseq_lens[3]`. This implies that `ansv` has at least 3 elements initially. Since the loop appends elements to `subseq_lens` and `ansv` is updated accordingly, we need to ensure that `ansv` has enough elements to cover the range of the loop.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `ansv` must have at least as many elements as the upper bound of the loop, which is `len(ansv) - 1`. Given that `i` starts from `len(subseq_lens) + 1` and `len(subseq_lens)` is at least 4, we need to ensure that `ansv` has at least 5 elements (since `i` starts from 5).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be adjusted to start from `0` and go up to `len(ansv) - 1`.
   - `ansv` should have at least 5 elements to ensure the loop can execute properly.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `ansv`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `ansv` must have at least 5 elements**
