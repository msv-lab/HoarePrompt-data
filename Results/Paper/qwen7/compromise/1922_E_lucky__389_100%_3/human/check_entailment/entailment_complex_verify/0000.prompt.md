You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    #In simpler terms, `mx` will hold the maximum length of the subsequence found during the loop's iterations, `x` will be reduced to 0 after all iterations, `subseq_lens` will contain a list of lengths of subsequences found, and `i` will be the highest power of 2 that fits into the current value of `x` at the beginning of each iteration.

    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `subseq_lens` will contain at least four elements (since it starts with at least two elements and the loop appends one more element per iteration). The variable `ansv` will have been updated to include the last three elements that were appended to `subseq_lens` during the loop's iterations. The variable `i` will be set to the length of `subseq_lens` plus one, indicating that the loop has completed its execution. The value of `mx` will be the highest value found in `subseq_lens`, and `t` remains within the specified range.

    print()
    #This is printed: Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer input `x` and processes it to find the maximum length of a subsequence where each element is a power of 2. It then constructs a list `ansv` based on this maximum length and prints the length of `ansv` followed by its elements. The function ultimately returns `None`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, but it does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to produce an array of length at most 200 when the required number of increasing subsequences is 37. 

For instance, when `X = 37`, the program constructs an array `[0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 6, 7, 8, 7, 8, 9, 8, 9, 10, 9, 10, 11, 10, 11, 12, 11, 12, 13, 12, 13, 14, 13, 14, 15, 14, 15, 16, 15, 16, 17, 16, 17, 18, 17, 18, 19, 18, 19, 20, 19, 20, 21, 20, 21, 22, 21, 22, 23, 22, 23, 24, 23, 24, 25, 24, 25, 26, 25, 26, 27, 26, 27, 28, 27, 28, 29, 28, 29, 30, 29, 30, 31, 30, 31, 32, 31, 32, 33, 32, 33, 34, 33, 34, 35, 34, 35, 36, 35, 36, 37, 36, 37, 38, 37, 38, 39, 38, 39, 40, 39, 40, 41, 40, 41, 42, 41, 42, 43, 42, 43, 44, 43, 44, 45, 44, 45, 46, 45, 46, 47, 46, 47, 48, 47, 48, 49, 48, 49, 50, 49, 50, 51, 50, 51, 52, 51, 52, 53, 52, 53, 54, 53, 54, 55, 54, 55, 56, 55, 56, 57, 56, 57, 58, 57, 58, 59, 58, 59, 60, 59, 60, 61, 60, 61, 62, 61, 62, 63, 62, 63, 64, 63, 64, 65, 64, 65, 66, 65, 66, 67, 66, 67, 68, 67, 68, 69, 68, 69, 70, 69, 70, 71, 70, 71, 72, 71, 72, 73, 72, 73, 74, 73, 74, 75, 74, 75, 76, 75, 76, 77, 76, 77, 78, 77, 78, 79, 78, 79, 80, 79, 80, 81, 80, 81, 82, 81, 82, 83, 82, 83, 84, 83, 84, 85, 84, 85, 86, 85, 86, 87, 86, 87, 88, 87, 88, 89, 88, 89, 90, 89, 90, 91, 90, 91, 92, 91, 92, 93, 92, 93, 94, 93, 94, 95, 94, 95, 96, 95, 96, 97, 96, 97, 98, 97, 98, 99, 98, 99, 100, 99, 100, 101, 100, 101, 102, 101, 102, 103, 102, 103, 104, 103, 104, 105, 104, 105, 106, 105, 106, 107, 106, 107, 108, 107, 108, 109, 108, 109, 110, 109, 110, 111, 110, 111, 112, 111, 112, 113, 112, 113, 114, 113, 114, 115, 114, 115, 116, 115, 116, 117, 116, 117, 118, 117, 118, 119, 118, 119, 120, 119, 120, 121, 120, 121, 122, 121, 122, 123, 122, 123, 124, 123, 124, 125, 124, 125, 126, 125, 126, 127, 126, 127, 128, 127, 128, 129, 128, 129, 130, 129, 130, 131, 130, 131, 132, 131, 132, 133, 132, 133, 134, 133, 134, 135, 134, 135, 136, 135, 136, 137, 136, 137, 138, 137, 138, 139, 138, 139, 140, 139, 140, 141, 140, 141, 142, 141, 142, 143, 142, 143, 144, 143, 144, 145, 144, 145, 146, 145, 146, 147, 146, 147, 148, 147, 148, 149, 148, 149, 150, 149, 150, 151, 150, 151, 152, 151, 152, 153, 152, 153, 154, 153, 154, 155, 154, 155, 156, 155, 156, 157, 156, 157, 158, 157, 158, 159, 158, 159, 160, 159, 160, 161, 160, 161, 162, 161, 162, 163, 162, 163, 164, 163, 164, 165, 164, 165, 166, 165, 166, 167, 166, 167, 168, 167, 168, 169, 168, 169, 170, 169, 170, 171, 170, 171, 172, 171, 172, 173, 172, 173, 174, 173, 174, 175, 174, 175, 176, 175, 176, 177, 176, 177, 178, 177, 178, 179, 178, 179, 180, 179, 180, 181, 180, 181, 182, 181, 182, 183, 182, 183, 184, 183, 184, 185, 184, 185, 186, 185, 186, 187, 186, 187, 188, 187, 188, 189, 188, 189, 190, 189, 190, 191, 190, 191, 192, 191, 192, 193, 192, 193, 194, 193, 194, 195, 194, 195, 196, 195, 196, 197, 196, 197, 198, 197, 198, 199, 198, 199, 200, 199, 200]`.

This array has more than 200 elements, which violates the requirement that the array length should be at most 200. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
