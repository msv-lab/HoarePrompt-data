Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `T`. Since `T` is not defined in the provided information, we assume it is a boolean variable that controls the loop.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - All elements in the list `a` will either be 0 or positive.
   - `l` will be equal to `r`.
   - `k` will be less than or equal to 0.
   - `ans` will be incremented by 1 if `k >= a[l]`, and the loop will terminate as the conditions `l < r` and `k > 0` will no longer be satisfied.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `T` must be `True`.
   - The conditions `l < r` and `k > 0` must not be satisfied, meaning `l` must be equal to `r` and `k` must be less than or equal to 0.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `l` is already equal to `r` and `k` is already less than or equal to 0, these conditions do not change.
   - The only thing that needs to be ensured is that `T` remains `True` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is ensuring that `T` is `True`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`T` must be True**
