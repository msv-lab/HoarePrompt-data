Postcondition: **`T` is False, `n` is an integer value, `k` is adjusted based on the condition (either `k - 2 * min(a[0], a[n-1])` or remains as is), `l` is either 1 or 0, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `ans` is either 2 or 1, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n-1])`, and `t` is `k % 2` if the else part is executed.**
