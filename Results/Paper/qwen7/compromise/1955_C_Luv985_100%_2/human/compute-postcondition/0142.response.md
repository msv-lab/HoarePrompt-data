Output State: **`k` is `k - mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`; `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`; `ans` is `ans + 1`; `l` is `l + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1, while the other variables (`k`, `mi`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
