Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `mi * 2 > k`; `t` is `k % 2`.**

The code calculates `t` as `k % 2`, which means `t` is the remainder when `k` is divided by 2. The conditions and values of `n`, `k`, `mi`, and the relationship between `mi` and `k` remain unchanged.
