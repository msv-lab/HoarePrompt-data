Postcondition: **`mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `l` must be less than `r`, and `k` must be greater than 0. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, `ans` is increased by 2, `l` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are each decreased by `mi`. If `a[r]` is not 0, the original conditions of `k`, `ans`, `l`, `r`, `a[l]`, and `a[r]` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `t` is `k % 2`, `ans` is increased by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
