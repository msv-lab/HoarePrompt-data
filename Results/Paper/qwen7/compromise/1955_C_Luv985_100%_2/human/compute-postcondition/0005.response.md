Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer converted from the original string `n`; `k` is a string.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(n)` converts the string `n` into an integer and assigns it back to `n`. The variable `T` remains unchanged, and `k` also remains unchanged.
