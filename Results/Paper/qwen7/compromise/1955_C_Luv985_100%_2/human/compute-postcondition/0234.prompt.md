Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is False, `n` is an integer value, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers (the result of mapping int to each element of the original list), `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is False, `n` is an integer value, `k` is adjusted based on the condition (either `k - 2 * min(a[0], a[n-1])` or remains as is), `l` is either 1 or 0, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `ans` is either 2 or 1, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n-1])`, and `t` is `k % 2` if the else part is executed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `T` is False, `n` is an integer value, `k` is adjusted based on the condition, `l` is either 2 or 1, `r` is either `n - 3` or `n - 2`, `ans` is either 3, 4, or 1, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, and `t` is `k % 2`. If `a[r]` is 0 after the if part, `r` is updated to `n - 3`. If the else part is executed, `r` remains `n - 2` and `ans` is 3.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `k` is reduced by `mi * 2` and `ans` is increased by 1 if `mi * 2 <= k` and `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `t` (where `t` is the remainder when `k` is divided by 2), and `ans` remains unchanged. `a[l]` and `a[r]` are reduced by `mi` if the condition `mi * 2 <= k` is true.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
