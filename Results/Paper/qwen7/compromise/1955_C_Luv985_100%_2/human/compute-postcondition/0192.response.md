Postcondition: **`T` is False, `n` is an integer value, `k` is less than twice the minimum of the first and last elements of list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n-1])`, `t` is `k % 2`, if the value of `a[l] - t - k // 2` is 0, then `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.**
