Output State: **`k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[l+1]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `ans` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Therefore, `a[l]` changes to `a[l+1]`. The other variables (`k`, `a[r]`, and `ans`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
