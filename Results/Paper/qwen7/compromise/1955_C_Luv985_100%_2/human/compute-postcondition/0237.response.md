Postcondition: **`T` is False, `n` is an integer value, `k` is 0, `l` and `r` are such that they point to adjacent elements or one of them is out of bounds, `ans` is the total number of times `a[l]` or `a[r]` became 0, `mi` is the minimum value between the two elements being processed in the last step, and `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2 if the else part of the last iteration was executed. If `l == r` is true, `ans` is increased by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`.**
