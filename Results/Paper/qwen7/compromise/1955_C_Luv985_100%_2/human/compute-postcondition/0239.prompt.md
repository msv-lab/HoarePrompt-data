Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All elements in the list `a` will either be 0 or positive, `l` will be equal to `r`, `k` will be less than or equal to 0, and `ans` will be incremented by 1 if `k >= a[l]`, and the loop will terminate as the conditions `l < r` and `k > 0` will no longer be satisfied.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `T` is False, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list using map and lambda, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is the value of `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the values in `a`, `ans` is the total count of zeros in the list `a` after all iterations, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `ans` is incremented by `k >= a[l]` if `l` equals `r`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `T` is False, `n` is an integer value, `k` is 0, `l` and `r` are such that they point to adjacent elements or one of them is out of bounds, `ans` is the total number of times `a[l]` or `a[r]` became 0, `mi` is the minimum value between the two elements being processed in the last step, and `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2 if the else part of the last iteration was executed. If `l == r` is true, `ans` is increased by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
