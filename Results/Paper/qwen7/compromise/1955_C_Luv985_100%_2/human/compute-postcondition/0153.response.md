Output State: **`mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `t` is `k % 2`; `ans` remains unchanged; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of `mi`, `t`, or `ans`. It only breaks out of the loop or if statement, indicating that the program flow moves to the next line of code outside the loop or conditional block.
