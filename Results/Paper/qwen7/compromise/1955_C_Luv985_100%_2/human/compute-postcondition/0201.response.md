Output State: **`T` is False, `n` is an integer value, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is either 3 or 2, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, and `t` is `k % 2` if the else part is executed.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
