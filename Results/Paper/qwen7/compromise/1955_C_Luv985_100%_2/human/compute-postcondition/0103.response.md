Postcondition: **`T` is False, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list using map and lambda, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `a[r] == 0`, then the current value of `l` is 1 and the current value of `ans` is 1. Otherwise, the current value of `l` remains 0 and the current value of `ans` remains 0.**
