Output State: **`mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from `a[l]`. Here, `mi` is defined as the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. After executing this line, the value of `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi`, while `mi` remains unchanged.
