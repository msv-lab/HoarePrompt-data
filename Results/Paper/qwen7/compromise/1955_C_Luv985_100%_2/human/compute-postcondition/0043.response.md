Output State: **`k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `ans` is increased by 1.**

This means that the variable `k` has been decreased by `mi * 2`, the element `a[l]` has been decreased by `mi`, the element `a[r]` has been decreased by `mi`, and the variable `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain in their initial states relative to the precondition.
