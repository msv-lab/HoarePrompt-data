Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, and `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from `a[r]`. Given that `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[r]` is now reduced by `mi`. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
