Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: t, n, and k. t is an integer within the range of 1 to 676, inclusive. For each test case, n and k are integers within the range of 1 to 26, inclusive. The function returns a value based on the input parameters.**

This means the function `func` takes three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. The parameter `t` is an integer that must be between 1 and 676, inclusive. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers that must be between 1 and 26, inclusive. Based on these inputs, the function returns a specific value, though the exact nature of the return value is not specified in the given information.
