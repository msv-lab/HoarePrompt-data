Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, and `t` is now the integer input value.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is an integer within the range 1 to 676, the precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676 remains valid, and the value of `t` is updated to the input value. The variables `n` and `k` are not mentioned in the initial state and are not affected by this code.
