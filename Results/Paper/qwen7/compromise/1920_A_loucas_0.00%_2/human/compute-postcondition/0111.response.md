Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is set to `min(less)`. This means `i` takes the minimum value from the list `less`.
   - `max(big)` remains less than `min(less)`. This indicates that the maximum value in the list `big` is strictly less than the minimum value in the list `less`.
   - `num` is assigned the value of `i`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(num)`. Since `num` is assigned the value of `i`, it will print the value of `i`.

Given these details, the value of `num` is the minimum value from the list `less`. Therefore, the print statement will output this value.

Output: **i (where i is the minimum value from the list less)**
