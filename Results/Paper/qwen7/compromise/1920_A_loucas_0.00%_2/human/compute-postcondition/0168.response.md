Functionality: **The function processes a series of constraints defined by the user. For each test case, it categorizes integers into three lists based on their type (1, 2, or 3). After processing all constraints, it finds and prints the smallest integer greater than all integers in the 'big' list and less than all integers in the 'less' list, excluding integers in the 'no' list. If no such integer exists, it prints the maximum integer in the 'big' list.**
