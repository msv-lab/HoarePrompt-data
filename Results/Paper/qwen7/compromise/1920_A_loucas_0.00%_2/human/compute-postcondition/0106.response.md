Output State: **`i` is `min(less)`, `max(big)` remains less than `min(less)`, `num` is `i`**

Explanation: The code `num = i` simply assigns the current value of `i` (which is `min(less)`) to `num`. The conditions that `max(big)` remains less than `min(less)` and `num` is `i` are still valid after the assignment.
