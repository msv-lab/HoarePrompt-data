Output State: **`iterable2` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `big` is a list containing the value of `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Since `x` and `a` are updated to the integer values from the input, they remain unchanged except that `big` now contains `a`. The value of `iterable2` remains 2 as it was not affected by the code.
