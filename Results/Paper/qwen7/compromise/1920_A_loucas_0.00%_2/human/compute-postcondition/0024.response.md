Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, `iterable` is 1, `less` is either a list containing the input integer `a` or an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`, `num` is 0, `x` is the first input integer, and `a` is the second input integer.**

Explanation: The code `x, a = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `a` respectively. The values of `loop`, `iterable`, `less`, `big`, and `no` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `num` remains 0 as it was not affected by the code.
