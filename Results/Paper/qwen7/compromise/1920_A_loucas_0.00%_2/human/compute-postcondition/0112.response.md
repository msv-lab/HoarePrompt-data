Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `iterable` variable and the `range(loop)` function. However, since the loop body is omitted, we focus on the variables directly involved in the loop condition.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `iterable` is within the range specified by `range(loop)`. This means `iterable` should be less than `loop`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `min(less)`
   - `max(big)` remains less than `min(less)`
   - `num` is `i`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `iterable` (which is equivalent to `i` in this context) must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `min(less) + 1`.
   - The condition `max(big) < min(less)` must still hold true.
   - `num` will be updated to the new value of `i`, which is `min(less) + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be `min(less) + 1`.
   - `max(big)` remains less than `min(less)`.
   - `num` will be `min(less) + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `min(less) + 1`, `max(big)` remains less than `min(less)`, and `num` is `min(less) + 1`**
