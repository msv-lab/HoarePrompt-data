Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(max(big), min(less))`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to the start of the range, which is `max(big)`. Therefore, `i` must be set to `max(big)` at the start of the loop.

3. **Determine the Range of the Loop**: The range is defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`. For the loop to execute, `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`. This ensures there are valid values for `i` to iterate over.

4. **Consider the Final State of `i`**: The loop will continue until `i` reaches `min(less)`. Therefore, the final value of `i` should be `min(less) - 1`.

5. **Adjust the State of `max(big)` and `min(less)`**: Since these values determine the range of the loop, they must be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute and complete its iterations.

Given the above points, we need to adjust the initial state of `i` to `max(big)` and ensure that `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`. Additionally, since `i` will be incremented within the loop, the final state of `i` should be `min(less) - 1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` must be set to `max(big)`
- `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`
- The final value of `i` should be `min(less) - 1`

Putting this into the required format:

**State: **`i` is `max(big)`, `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`, `i` will be `min(less) - 1` after all iterations**
