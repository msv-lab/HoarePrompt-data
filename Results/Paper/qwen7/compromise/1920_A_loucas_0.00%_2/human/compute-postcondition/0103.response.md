Output State: **`i` is assigned the value of `min(less)`, `max(big)` remains less than `min(less)`, and `num` is `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `max(big)`, and `num` remain unchanged, and we simply indicate that the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
