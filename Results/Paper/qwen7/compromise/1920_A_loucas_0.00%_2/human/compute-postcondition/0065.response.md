Output State: **`iterable2` is 0, `x` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `big` is a list containing the input integer `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the input integer `a` to the list `big`. The other variables (`iterable2` and `x`) remain unchanged. After executing the line `big.append(a)`, `big` becomes a list that includes the input integer `a`.
