Output State: **`loop` must be an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, `iterable` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `no`. None of the other variables (`loop`, `iterable`, `less`, `big`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
