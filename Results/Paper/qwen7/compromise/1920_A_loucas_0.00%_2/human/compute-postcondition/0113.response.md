Output State: **`i` is `min(less) + 1`, `max(big)` remains less than `min(less)`, `num` is `min(less) + 1`, and `less` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `less`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `max(big)`, `num`, or their relationships. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
