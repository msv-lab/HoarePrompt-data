Output State: **`i` is `min(less) + 1`, `max(big)` remains less than `min(less)`, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing `[a]`, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `x` is not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code `no.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Initially, `no` is an empty list. After appending `a`, `no` becomes a list containing `[a]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
