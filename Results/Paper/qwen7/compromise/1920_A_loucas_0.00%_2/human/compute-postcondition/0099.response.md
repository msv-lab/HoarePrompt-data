Output State: **`num` is `i`, `i` is `min(less) - 1`, `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`, and `i` is not in `no`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no variables are updated by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
