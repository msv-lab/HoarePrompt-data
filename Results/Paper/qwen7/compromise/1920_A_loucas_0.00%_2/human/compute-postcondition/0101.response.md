Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the range for variable `i` as `range(max(big), min(less))`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `min(less) - 1`
   - `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`
   - `i` is not in `no`

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be within the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`.
   - Given that `i` is currently `min(less) - 1` and `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`, the next value of `i` would be `min(less)`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `min(less)`.
   - `max(big)` remains the same since it is not affected by the loop.
   - `i` is not in `no` still holds true because `i` is now `min(less)` and it was not in `no` before.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `min(less)`, `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`, and `i` is not in `no`**
