Output State: **`max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is `max(big) + 1`, and `num` is `max(big) + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered within the given code snippet, the conditions and values of the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, except for the fact that we break out of the loop or conditional block.
