The function accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, both non-negative integers. It checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and if the sum of the remainder when extroverts is divided by 3 and the number of universals is at least 3. If these conditions are met, it returns the minimum number of tents required, calculated as the ceiling value of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3. If the conditions are not met, it returns None.
