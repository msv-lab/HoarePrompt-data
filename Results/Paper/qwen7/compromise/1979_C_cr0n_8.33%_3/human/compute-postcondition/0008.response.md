Based on the initial state provided:

- `vprod` is a list where each element is the value of `prod` divided by each corresponding element in `vals`.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `N` remains unchanged.
- `den` is defined as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
- The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print(-1)
```

Given that `den` is less than or equal to 0, this information is not directly relevant to the print statement itself, which simply outputs `-1`.

Output: **-1**
