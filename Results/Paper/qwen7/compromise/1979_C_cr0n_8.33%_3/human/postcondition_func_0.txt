The function reads a positive integer N and a list of N positive integers from input. It calculates the product of all elements in the list and then computes a new list where each element is the product of all elements divided by the corresponding element in the original list. If the denominator (product minus the sum of the new list) is less than or equal to zero, it prints -1 and stops. Otherwise, it prints the new list. The function does not return any value.
