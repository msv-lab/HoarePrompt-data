Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes `N` (number of outcomes) and `vals` (list of multipliers).
3. **Product Calculation**: It calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`), which is necessary for determining the required bets.
4. **Bet Calculation**: It computes `vprod`, a list where each element is the product of all multipliers divided by the corresponding multiplier. This calculation ensures that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome.
5. **Validation**: It checks if `den` (difference between `prod` and the sum of `vprod` values) is greater than 0. If not, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists.
6. **Output**: If a valid distribution exists, it prints the bets for each outcome.

However, there is an issue with the logic in the code:
- The condition `if (den <= 0) :` should be `if (den > 0) :` because we need to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.
- Additionally, the `return` statement after printing `-1` is unnecessary and could be removed since the function will naturally exit after printing.

Given these points, the current implementation is almost correct but has a minor logical error in the validation step.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the code, change the condition to `if (den > 0) :` and remove the unnecessary `return` statement.
