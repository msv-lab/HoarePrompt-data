### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its function summary against the problem description and the expected behavior.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements:**
   - We need to distribute coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - The program should output `-1` if no such distribution exists, otherwise, it should output a valid distribution of coins.

2. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func_1` reads a positive integer \(N\) and a list of \(N\) positive integers from input.
   - It calculates the product of all elements in the list.
   - It then computes a new list where each element is the product of all elements divided by the corresponding element in the original list.
   - If the denominator (product minus the sum of the new list) is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1` and stops.
   - Otherwise, it prints the new list.

3. **Analysis of the Program:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \(N\) and the list of multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_N\).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers.
   - It then computes a new list where each element is the product of all multipliers divided by the corresponding multiplier in the original list.
   - It checks if the denominator (product minus the sum of the new list) is less than or equal to zero. If so, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the new list.

4. **Evaluation Against the Problem:**
   - The program's approach of calculating the product and then distributing the coins based on the product is fundamentally flawed. It does not ensure that the total bet amount is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome.
   - Consider the example provided in the original assessment:
     - Input:
       ```
       3
       3 2 7
       ```
     - Expected Output:
       ```
       27 41 12
       ```
     - Program Output:
       ```
       27 34 6
       ```
   - The program calculates the product of the multipliers as \(3 \times 2 \times 7 = 42\).
   - It then computes the new list as:
     - \(42 / 3 = 14\)
     - \(42 / 2 = 21\)
     - \(42 / 7 = 6\)
   - The total bet amount is \(14 + 21 + 6 = 41\), which is less than the winnings for the first outcome (\(3 \times 14 = 42\)), but it is not the correct distribution as per the problem requirements.

5. **Correct Solution Approach:**
   - A correct solution would involve finding a way to distribute the coins such that the total bet amount is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome.
   - One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we start with the highest multiplier and distribute the minimum required coins to satisfy the condition for that outcome, then move to the next highest multiplier, and so on.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not ensure that the total bet amount is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
