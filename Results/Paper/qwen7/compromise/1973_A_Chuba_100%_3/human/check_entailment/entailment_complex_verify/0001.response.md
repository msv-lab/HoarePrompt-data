### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` and stores them in a list `v`.

2. **Initial Check for Consistency:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in total if it's a draw).
   - This check is necessary because the total score must be even for the scores to be achievable through the described game rules.

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
     \]
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`: Total points scored by all three players.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])`: Ensures that we do not subtract more than what is available from the scores of the other players. This term ensures that the calculation does not go negative.
     - Subtracting this term from the total points and dividing by 2 gives the maximum number of draws.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the sum of the scores is odd correctly by printing `-1`.
   - However, the formula provided might not handle some edge cases correctly. Specifically, the formula assumes that the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores can be entirely attributed to draws, which might not always be true.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Case 1:** `0 0 0`
  - Sum is `0`, which is even. Result: `0` (correct).

- **Case 2:** `0 1 1`
  - Sum is `2`, which is even. Result: `1` (correct).

- **Case 3:** `1 1 1`
  - Sum is `3`, which is odd. Result: `-1` (correct).

- **Case 4:** `1 1 2`
  - Sum is `4`, which is even. Result: `2` (correct).

- **Case 5:** `3 3 3`
  - Sum is `9`, which is odd. Result: `-1` (correct).

- **Case 6:** `3 4 5`
  - Sum is `12`, which is even. Result: `6` (correct).

- **Case 7:** `1 1 10`
  - Sum is `12`, which is even. Result: `2` (correct).

### Issue with the Formula:

The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
\[
\text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
\]

This formula does not correctly account for all possible scenarios. Consider the following counterexample:

- **Counterexample:** `1 1 5`
  - Sum is `7`, which is odd. Result: `-1` (correct).
  - However, let's manually verify if this is possible:
    - Possible scores: `1 1 5`
    - If there were no draws, the only way to achieve these scores would be:
      - Player 1 wins against Player 2 (2 points for Player 1, 0 for Player 2).
      - Player 1 wins against Player 3 (2 points for Player 1, 0 for Player 3).
      - Player 2 wins against Player 3 (2 points for Player 2, 0 for Player 3).
    - This results in `2 2 1`, which does not match the given scores.
    - To achieve `1 1 5`, the only way is if Player 3 wins against Player 1 and Player 2 in a draw (1 point each), and then wins against Player 2 again (2 points for Player 3).
    - This results in `1 1 5` with 2 draws.
    - Therefore, the maximum number of draws is `2`.

The formula fails to correctly account for this scenario, leading to an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is partially correct but incomplete. While the program correctly identifies when the sum of the scores is odd, the formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is flawed and does not handle all edge cases correctly.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
