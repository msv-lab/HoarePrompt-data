### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` and stores them in a list `v`.

2. **Initial Check for Consistency:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in total if it's a draw).
   - This check is necessary because the sum of the scores should be even for the scores to be achievable through the described game rules.

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
     \]
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`: Total points scored by all three players.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])`: Ensures that we do not subtract more than what is available from the scores of the other players. This term ensures that the calculation does not go negative.
     - Subtracting this term from the total points and dividing by 2 gives the maximum number of draws.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the sum of the scores is odd correctly by printing `-1`.
   - However, the formula provided might not handle some edge cases correctly. Specifically, the formula assumes that the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores can be entirely attributed to draws, which might not always be true.

### Example Analysis:

- **Case 1:** `0 0 0`
  - Sum is `0`, which is even. Result: `0` (correct).

- **Case 2:** `0 1 1`
  - Sum is `2`, which is even. Result: `1` (correct).

- **Case 3:** `1 1 1`
  - Sum is `3`, which is odd. Result: `-1` (correct).

- **Case 4:** `1 1 2`
  - Sum is `4`, which is even. Result: `2` (correct).

- **Case 5:** `3 3 3`
  - Sum is `9`, which is odd. Result: `-1` (correct).

- **Case 6:** `3 4 5`
  - Sum is `12`, which is even. Result: `6` (correct).

- **Case 7:** `1 1 10`
  - Sum is `12`, which is even. Result: `2` (correct).

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the logic and the examples, the program appears to be correct in handling the given constraints and examples. The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws seems to work for the provided test cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
