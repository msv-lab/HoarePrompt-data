Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either '-1' or a non-negative integer. The exact values depend on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. Each line corresponds to the output of one iteration of the loop, where the value is determined based on the conditions specified in the loop body. If the sum of the three integers in the input does not yield an odd number, it prints '-1'. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a specific formula involving these integers.
