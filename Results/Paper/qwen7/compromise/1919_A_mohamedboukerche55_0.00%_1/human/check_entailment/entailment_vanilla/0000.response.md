Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` which contains two space-separated integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Parsing Input:**
   - The program splits the string `s` using `split()` and converts the first and second elements to integers `a` and `b`.
   - This part of the code is correct as it correctly extracts the values of `a` and `b`.

3. **Winning Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'bob'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'alice'.

4. **Game Logic:**
   - According to the problem, the game involves alternating moves where a player can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet.
   - The key observation here is that the game ends when both wallets are empty, and the player whose turn it is next loses.
   - The winning strategy depends on whether the sum of coins in both wallets is even or odd after all possible moves.

5. **Correctness of the Winning Condition:**
   - If the sum of coins in both wallets is even, the second player (Bob) can always force a win by mirroring the first player's (Alice) moves.
   - If the sum of coins in both wallets is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force a win by ensuring she makes the last move.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the sum of coins being even or odd. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem statement.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
