Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. According to the problem description, the game is won by the player who can force the opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move. The program incorrectly determines the winner based on the sum of the coins in both wallets being even or odd, which does not align with the optimal strategy for the game.

For example, consider the test case where `a = 1` and `b = 4`. Based on the optimal strategy, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by exchanging wallets on her first move, leaving Bob with 0 coins and thus making him lose. However, the program incorrectly outputs "bob" because `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should simulate the game or use a more sophisticated logic to determine the winner based on the optimal moves.
