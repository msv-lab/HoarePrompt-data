Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, increasing `i` by 1 will make `i` equal to 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must remain the same (since it is a positive integer and does not change within the loop head).

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains a positive integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer**
