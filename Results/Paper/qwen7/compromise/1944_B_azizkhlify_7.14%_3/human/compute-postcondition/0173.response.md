Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` remains unchanged, and `ul` is the original value of `ul` plus 6**.

Explanation: The variable `ul` is incremented by 2, so if its original value was `original_value`, after the execution of `ul += 2`, its new value is `original_value + 2`. Given that the initial state mentions `ul` is the original value of `ul` plus 4, after the increment, `ul` becomes the original value of `ul` plus 6. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
