Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, and `ul` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this context, since no loop or conditional structure is explicitly mentioned in the code snippet, the only thing we can infer is that the execution is terminated at this point. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `ul` remain as they were in the initial state.
