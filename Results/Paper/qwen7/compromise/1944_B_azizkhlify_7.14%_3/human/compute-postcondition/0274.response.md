Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be such that `i` is less than `2 * n`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` by 1. However, the initial values of `a` and `r` are not provided, so we cannot specify the exact value of `r[a[i] - 1]`. We know that `i` is `n + 1` and `n` must be such that `i` is less than `2 * n`, which means `n + 1 < 2 * n` or `n > 1`. The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, but its initial value is not specified.
