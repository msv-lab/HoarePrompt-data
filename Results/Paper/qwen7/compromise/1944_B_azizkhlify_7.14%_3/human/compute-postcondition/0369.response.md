Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ur` retains its original value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the conditions for updating `ur` were checked. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial postconditions, and `ur` retains its original value since no further updates are made to it after the `break`.
