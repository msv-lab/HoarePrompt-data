Output State: **Postcondition: `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n + 1`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` remains 2.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match statement. In this case, since there is no loop or match statement context provided, the `break` statement does not change any variable values. It simply exits the current loop or match statement. Therefore, the values of `res`, `i`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
