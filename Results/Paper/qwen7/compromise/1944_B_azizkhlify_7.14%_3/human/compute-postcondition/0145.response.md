Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n, 2 * n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is unchanged.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n` to `2 * n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1 (i.e., `i = n + 1`).
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented again because `i` is now `n + 1`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented again, but since the exact value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is not given, we only need to know that it will be incremented.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**
