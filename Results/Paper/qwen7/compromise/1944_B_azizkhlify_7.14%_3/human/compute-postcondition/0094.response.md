Based on the initial state provided, `res` is a non-empty list with at least one fewer element. This means that `res` has some elements, but it does not specify the exact number of elements or their values. The variable `i` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value from the given information.

Given the code snippet:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the output will include the value of `i`, which is unknown.

Output: **i**
