Output State: **`i` is `n-1`; `a[i] - 1` index in list `l` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` by 1. Given that `i` is `n-1` and `n` is greater than 0, the value of `i` remains unchanged, but the value at the index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is incremented by 1.
