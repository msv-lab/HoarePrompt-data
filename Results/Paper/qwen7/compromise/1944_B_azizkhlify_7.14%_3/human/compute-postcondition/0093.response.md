Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in res:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `res`.

2. **Understand the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - The state at the end of the previous iteration is that `res` is a non-empty list.

3. **Determine the Change in State**:
   - After processing one element from `res`, `res` will have at least one fewer element. This means that at the start of the next iteration, `res` will still be a non-empty list but with one fewer element than it had at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Formulate the New State**:
   - Since `res` is a non-empty list at the end of the previous iteration, after one iteration, `res` will still be a non-empty list but with one fewer element. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change.

### Final Answer
State: **`res` is a non-empty list with at least one fewer element**.

In more formal terms:
State: **`res` is a non-empty list with at least one fewer element**.
