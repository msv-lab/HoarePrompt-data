Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 4.
- `n` must be greater than 4.
- `res` contains the value of `a[0]` appended with `a[3]`.
- `k` and `ul` are set such that the loop can proceed according to the postconditions.
- `re` is equal to `k + 1`.
- If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], end=' ')`.

Given that `i` is 4, the code will print the element at index 4 of the list `a`. Since no specific values for `a` are provided other than `res`, which is `a[0]` appended with `a[3]`, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[4]`. However, based on the information provided, we know that `i` is set to 4, so the code will attempt to print the element at index 4.

Output: **a[4]**
