Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` must contain at least one element.
- `i` is the second element in `res`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

Since `i` is explicitly stated to be the second element in `res`, the print statement will output the value of `i`.

Output: **i (where i is the second element in res)**
