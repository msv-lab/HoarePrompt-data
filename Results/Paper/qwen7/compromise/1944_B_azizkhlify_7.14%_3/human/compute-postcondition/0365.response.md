Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to `n + 1`
- `n` must be greater than 0

Given these conditions, let's break down the print statement:

```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Here, `a` is a list, and `i` is an index into this list. Since `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is greater than 0, `i` will be at least 1 (since the smallest possible value for `n` is 1, making `i` equal to 2).

However, the exact value of `a[i]` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i]`. We only know that `i` is `n + 1`.

So, the print statement will output the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Output: **a[n + 1] a[n + 1]**
