Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The variable `res` contains all elements specified by the conditions in the loop, including `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[3]`, and potentially more elements based on the value of `k` and the condition `re == k`. The variable `i` will iterate through each element in `res` as the loop executes, and the loop will continue until all elements in `res` are printed. The current value of `ul` is not equal to the current value of `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, if `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `ur` is 2, and `ul` equals `ur`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `ur` retains its original value. If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `ur` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
