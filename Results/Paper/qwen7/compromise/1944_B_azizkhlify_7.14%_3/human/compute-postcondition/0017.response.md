Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `n`
- `i` must be less than `2 * n`
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i < 2 * n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- Therefore, `i` will become `n + 1`.

### Adjusting the State:
- Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `n + 1`.
- The condition `i < 2 * n` must still hold true.
- The state of `r[a[i] - 1]` being incremented by 1 does not change until the loop body is executed, but it is not part of the loop head.

### Updated State:
- `i` is now `n + 1`.
- `i` must still be less than `2 * n`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `i` must be less than `2 * n`**
