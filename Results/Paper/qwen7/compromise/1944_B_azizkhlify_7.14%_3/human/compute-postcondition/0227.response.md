Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an array that includes at least the elements `a[0]`, `a[3]`, and `a[5]`.
- `n` must be less than or equal to 5.
- `i` is now `n`.
- The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

From this, we know that `i` is equal to `n`, and since `n` is less than or equal to 5, `i` is also less than or equal to 5. Therefore, `i` could be any value from 0 to 5, but it specifically refers to an index in the array `a`.

Given that `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, this means that the element `a[i]` exists in the array `a`, and when you subtract 1 from `a[i]` and look up the corresponding value in array `r`, you get 2.

Since `a[i]` is an index in `a`, and we know `a` includes at least `a[0]`, `a[3]`, and `a[5]`, `a[i]` must be one of these indices. However, the specific value of `a[i]` is not explicitly given, but we know that `a[i]` is such that `r[a[i] - 1] = 2`.

Thus, the print statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **[a[i]] [a[i]]**
