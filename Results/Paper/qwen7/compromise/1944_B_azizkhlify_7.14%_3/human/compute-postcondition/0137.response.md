Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` must be less than `n-1` (since it just completed an iteration).

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged within the loop body.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 0 initially, it must remain greater than 0 throughout the loop.

3. **Array `l` and Indexing:**
   - The expression `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 during each iteration.
   - This operation does not affect the value of `n` or `i`.

### Adjusting the State
- **`i`**: Since the loop just completed an iteration, `i` must be equal to `n-1`.
- **`n`**: It must still be greater than 0.

### New State
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
