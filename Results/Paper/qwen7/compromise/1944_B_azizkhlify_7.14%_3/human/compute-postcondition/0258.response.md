Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` by taking input from the user, splitting the input string by spaces, and converting each element to an integer. The original values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The list `a` is populated with integers based on the input provided by the user.
