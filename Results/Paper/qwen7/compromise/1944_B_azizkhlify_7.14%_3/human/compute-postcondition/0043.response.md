Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is a positive integer
- `ul` remains unchanged (though `ul` is not used in the print statement)

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The value of `i` is 2.
2. The expression `a[i]` refers to the element at index 2 in the list `a`.
3. Since `a[i]` is called twice, both instances will print the same value, which is the element at index 2 in the list `a`.

Therefore, the output will be the element at index 2 in the list `a` printed twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **a[2] a[2]**
