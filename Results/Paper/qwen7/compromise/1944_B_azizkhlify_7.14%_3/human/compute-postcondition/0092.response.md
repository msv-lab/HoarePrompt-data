Based on the initial state described, `res` is a non-empty list, and `i` is the index of the current element being processed in the loop. Since `res` is a non-empty list at the start of the iteration, `i` will be the index of the first element of `res`.

Given that `res` is a non-empty list and `i` is the index of the first element, the value of `i` will be `0`.

Output: **0**
