Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
