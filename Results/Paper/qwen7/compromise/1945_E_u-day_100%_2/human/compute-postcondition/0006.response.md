Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`, `st` is an empty set.**

The code creates an empty set named `st`. This does not affect the values of `low`, `high`, `pos`, or the list `arr`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
