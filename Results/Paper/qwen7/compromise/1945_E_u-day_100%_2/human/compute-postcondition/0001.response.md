Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is a list generated by the function `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code `arr = func_2()` assigns the return value of the function `func_2()` to the variable `arr`. Since the exact nature of `func_2()` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in `arr`. However, we know that `n` and `k` have been updated by the function `func_1()`, and `arr` now holds the result of `func_2()`. The precondition that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n remains valid.
