Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts).
3. It then checks the conditions to determine the minimum cost:
   - If the price of two yogurts (`b`) is less than the price of one yogurt (`a`), it means buying two yogurts at once is cheaper. In this case, it calculates the total cost as `A * B` (where `A` is the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price, and `B` is the price for two yogurts).
   - If the number of yogurts `A` is even, it buys all yogurts in pairs, resulting in a total cost of `int(A * C / 2)`.
   - If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, it buys as many pairs as possible and then buys the remaining yogurt at the regular price, resulting in a total cost of `X * C + B` (where `X` is the number of pairs of yogurts).

Given these points, the logic in the program matches the problem statement and the conditions provided. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
