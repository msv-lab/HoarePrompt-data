Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, where each line represents the output of one iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if \(B \times 2 < C\), it prints \(A \times B\). If \(A\) is even and \(B \times 2 \geq C\), it prints \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\). Otherwise, it first prints \(X = \frac{A}{2}\) and then prints \(X \times C + B\).

Each line of output depends on the specific values of \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) provided for that iteration. Since the exact values of \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are not specified, the output state cannot be precisely quantified without knowing these values. However, the structure of the output is as described above.
