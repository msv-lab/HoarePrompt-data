Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `n-1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`
- The most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is incremented by 1
- The current value of `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`
- `count2` is greater than `count`

We need to determine what will be printed with the statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

Given that `j` is `n-1` and `n` is greater than 0, `j` must be a non-negative integer. The slicing operation `string[:j]` will take the substring from the start of `string` up to but not including the character at index `j`, and `string[j:]` will take the substring starting from the character at index `j` to the end of `string`.

Since `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, it confirms that `j` is correctly set to `n-1` and the characters at the start and end of the string do not match.

Therefore, the print statement will output two substrings: one from the start of the string up to but not including the last character, and the other from the last character to the end of the string.

Output: **string[:n-1], string[n-1:]**
