Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s[j]` is `s[0]`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, and `done` is True.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the variables `j`, `n`, `s[j]`, `count`, `count2`, and `done` remain unchanged from their initial states.
