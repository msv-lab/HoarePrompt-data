The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the behavior of `continue` is undefined outside of a loop context. Given the initial state and the fact that `continue` does not change any variable values or introduce new conditions, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `count`, `done` is False, `count` is greater than 0, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is 0, and `count2` is equal to `count`.**
