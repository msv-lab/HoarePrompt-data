Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` must be greater than 4, `done` is False, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of the list `s`.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the `continue` statement itself, all the variables retain their previous values. The conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged after executing the `continue` statement.
