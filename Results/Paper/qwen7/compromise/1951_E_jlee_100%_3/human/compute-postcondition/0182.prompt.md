Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is False, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `count`, `done` is True if `count` is greater than 1, otherwise `done` is True or False depending on the original value, `count` is greater than 0, and `count2` is either greater than or equal to `count` (if `count` > 1) or 0 (otherwise). Additionally, `s[j]` is either not equal to `x` or `count2` is increased by 1 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `count + 1`, `done` is True, `count` is equal to `j`, and `count2` is either 0 or greater than or equal to `count` (if `count` > 1). In both cases, `count2` is increased by 1 if the condition `s[j] != x` and `count < 1` is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `j`, `done`, `count`, `count2`, and `s` are as follows: `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` equals `count + 2`, `done` remains True, `count` equals `j`. If `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, `count2` is increased by 1. If `s[j] == x` or `count >= 1`, the loop breaks and `done` remains True. If `count2` is less than `count`, `count2` is increased by 1. If `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, `done` remains True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
