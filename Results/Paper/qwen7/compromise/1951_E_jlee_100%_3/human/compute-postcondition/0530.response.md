Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s[j]` is `s[1]`, `count` is 1, and `done` is True. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` equals `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, we continue with `count2` remaining 0. If `s[j]` equals `x` and `count2` is equal to `count`, `count2` becomes 1. If `s[j]` equals `x` and `count2` is greater than `count` or `count` is greater than 1, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
