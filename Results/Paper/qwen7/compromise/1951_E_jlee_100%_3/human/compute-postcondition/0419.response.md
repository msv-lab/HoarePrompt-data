Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `n-1`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`
- The most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is incremented by 1
- The current value of `count` is greater than 1, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`
- `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, and `count2` is equal to `count`

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])`.

Given that `j` is `n-1`, the slice `string[:j - 1]` will include all characters from the start of the string up to but not including the character at position `j - 1`. Since `j` is `n-1`, `j - 1` is `n-2`. Therefore, `string[:j - 1]` includes all characters from the start of the string up to but not including the character at position `n-2`.

The slice `string[j - 1:]` will include all characters from the character at position `j - 1` to the end of the string. Since `j - 1` is `n-2`, this slice starts from the character at position `n-2` and goes to the end of the string.

Therefore, the print statement will output two parts of the string: the part before the character at position `n-2` and the part starting from the character at position `n-2` to the end.

Output: **string[:n-2], string[n-2:]**
