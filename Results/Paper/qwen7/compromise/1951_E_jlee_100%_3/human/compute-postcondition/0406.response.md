Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `n-1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`
- `done` is `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is incremented by 1
- The current value of `count` is greater than 0
- `s[j]` is not equal to `x`
- `count2` is less than the current value of `count`

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
