Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is False, and either the count of `x` in `s` is equal to 1, or the count of `x` in `s` is equal to `n - 1`, where `n` is 1 and the middle element of `s` is not equal to `x` if `n` is odd, or `x` is equal to the last element of `s`.
