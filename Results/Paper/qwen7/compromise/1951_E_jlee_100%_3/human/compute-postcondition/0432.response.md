Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `n-1`, where `n` is greater than 0.
- `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.
- The most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is incremented by 1.
- The current value of `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is greater than `count`.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
