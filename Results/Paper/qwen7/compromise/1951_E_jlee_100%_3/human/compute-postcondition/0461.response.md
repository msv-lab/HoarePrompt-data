Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s[j]` is `s[0]`, `count` is 0, `count2` remains unchanged and is either less than or equal to `count`, and `done` is True. This is because if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` becomes 0, and `done` remains True. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold regardless of the if condition's evaluation.
