Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `count + 1`, `done` is True, `count` is equal to `j`, and `count2` is either greater than or equal to `count` (if `count` > 1) or 0 (otherwise). If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is equal to `j`.**
