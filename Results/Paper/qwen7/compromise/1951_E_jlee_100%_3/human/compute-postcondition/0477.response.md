Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[j]` is `s[0]`
- `count` is 0
- `count2` remains unchanged and is either less than or equal to `count`
- `done` is True

The print statement is simply `print(2)`. This statement will print the integer 2 directly without any conditions or calculations involving other variables.
