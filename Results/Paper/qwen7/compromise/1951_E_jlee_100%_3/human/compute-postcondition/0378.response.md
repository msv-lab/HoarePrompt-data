Postcondition: `done` is still False, `count` is `n-1`, `count2` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `i` is `t-1`, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first element of the list `s`. If `x` is not equal to the last element of the list `s` and `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part to alter the state, the overall postcondition is the same as the postcondition of the if part.
