Postcondition: `n`, `j`, `done`, `count`, `count2`, and `s` are as follows: `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` equals `count + 2`, `done` remains True, `count` equals `j`, and `count2` is either 0 or greater than or equal to `count` (if `count` > 1). If `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, `count2` remains unchanged. If `s[j] == x` or `count >= 1`, the loop may continue or break, but `done` remains True, and `count2` is increased by 1 if the loop breaks.
