Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s[j]` is `s[1]`, `count` is 1, `count2` is 0, and `done` is True.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
