Postcondition: `j` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, and either `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, in which case the most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is either unchanged or incremented by 1, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
