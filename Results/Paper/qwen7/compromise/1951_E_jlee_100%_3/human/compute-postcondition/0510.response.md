Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[j]` is `s[1]`
- `count` is 1
- `count2` is either 0 or 1
- `done` is True

We need to focus on the `print` statement:

```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

Given that `j` is 1, let's substitute this value into the slicing expressions:

- `string[:j - 1]` becomes `string[:1 - 1]` which simplifies to `string[:0]`. This will result in an empty string.
- `string[j - 1:]` becomes `string[1 - 1:]` which simplifies to `string[0:]`. This will result in the entire string `string`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the empty string followed by the entire string `string`.

Output: **'', string**
