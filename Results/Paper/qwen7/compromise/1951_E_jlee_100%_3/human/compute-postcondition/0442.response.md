Postcondition: `j` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is incremented by 1. The current value of `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. Additionally, `count2` remains unchanged and is either less than or equal to `count`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `j` will always be `n-1`, `n` will be greater than 0, and `s[j]` will not be equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. The loop or if statement is broken under certain conditions, and `count` will be incremented if `s[j]` equals `x`. Moreover, `count2` will remain the same and will not exceed `count`.
