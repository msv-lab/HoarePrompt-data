Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `count + 1`, `done` is True, `count` is equal to `j`, `count2` is either greater than or equal to `count` (if `count` > 1) or 0 (otherwise), and `count2` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `count2 += 1` increments the value of `count2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
