Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[j]` is `s[1]`
- `count` is 1
- `count2` is either 0 or 1
- `done` is True

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the other variables since the print statement does not reference any of them.

Output: **YES**
