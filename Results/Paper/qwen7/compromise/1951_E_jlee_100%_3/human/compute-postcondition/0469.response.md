Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[j]` is `s[0]`
- `count` is 0
- `count2` remains unchanged and is either less than or equal to `count`
- `done` is True

We need to evaluate the `print` statement:

```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

Given `j` is 0, let's break down the slicing operations:

1. `string[:j - 1]`: Since `j` is 0, `j - 1` is -1. In Python, `string[-1:]` refers to the last character of the string. So, `string[:j - 1]` is equivalent to `string[:-1]`, which means it will slice the string from the start up to but not including the last character.

2. `string[j - 1:]`: Again, since `j` is 0, `j - 1` is -1. Therefore, `string[j - 1:]` is equivalent to `string[-1:]`, which means it will slice the string starting from the last character to the end.

Combining these two slices, the `print` statement will output the string without its last character followed by the last character of the string.

Output: **string[:-1] string[-1:]**
