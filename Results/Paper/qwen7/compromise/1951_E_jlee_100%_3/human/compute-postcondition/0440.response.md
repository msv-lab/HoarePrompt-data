Postcondition: **`j` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is incremented by 1. The current value of `count` is greater than or equal to 1, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. Additionally, `count2` is greater than or equal to `count` and does not change.**

Explanation: 
- If `count2 == count`, then either `count > 1` or `count <= 1`. If `count > 1`, `count2` becomes equal to `count` and the loop or if statement breaks. If `count <= 1`, `count2` remains 0.
- If `count2 != count`, the postcondition from the else part applies, where `count2` remains greater than or equal to `count` and does not change.
