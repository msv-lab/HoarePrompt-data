Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `count + 2`, `done` remains True, `count` is equal to `j`, and `count2` is either 0 or greater than or equal to `count` (if `count` > 1). The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next one. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, the values of `n`, `j`, `done`, `count`, and `count2` remain unchanged from their initial states. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
