Postcondition: `j` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, and either `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, in which case `done` is `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is incremented by 1. The current value of `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. Additionally, `count2` remains unchanged and is either less than or equal to `count`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1.
