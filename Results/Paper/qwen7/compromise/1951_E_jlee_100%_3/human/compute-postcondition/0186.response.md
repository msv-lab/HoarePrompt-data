Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: All variables remain unchanged from their final state after the third iteration, and the variable `done` is `False`.

   - This means that `i` is 3 (since it was the third iteration).
   - `t` remains unchanged from its value after the third iteration.
   - `done` is still `False`.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `t`. Since `i` is currently 3, `t` must be greater than 3.

5. **Adjust the States**: We need to update the state such that the loop can potentially execute one more time. Therefore, `i` should be incremented to 4, and `t` must be greater than 4.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 4, `t` must be greater than 4, `done` is False**
