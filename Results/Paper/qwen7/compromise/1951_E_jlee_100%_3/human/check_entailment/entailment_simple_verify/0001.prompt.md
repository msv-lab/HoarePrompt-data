You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   
2. **Single Character String Handling:**
   - If the length of the string `n` is 1, the program prints "NO" because a single character cannot be split into non-palindromic substrings. This is correct.

3. **Checking for Non-Palindromic Substrings:**
   - The program checks if the first character `x` is different from the last character. If they are different, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring. This logic is correct.
   
4. **Handling Strings with All Characters the Same:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same, the program prints "NO". This is correct because such a string cannot be split into non-palindromic substrings.
   
5. **Handling Strings with Almost All Characters the Same:**
   - If all but one character are the same, the program again prints "NO". This is correct because such a string also cannot be split into non-palindromic substrings.
   
6. **General Case:**
   - The program then iterates through the string to find the first pair of characters that are different. If it finds such a pair, it prints "YES" and the string as a single non-palindromic substring. However, this logic is flawed because it only checks the first pair of different characters and does not ensure that the rest of the string can be split into non-palindromic substrings.
   
7. **Further Checks:**
   - The program attempts to further split the string into two non-palindromic substrings, but it does not handle all possible cases correctly. For example, it may miss valid partitions or incorrectly conclude that a partition is impossible when it is not.

### Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case: "sinktheyacht"**
   - Expected Output: 
     ```
     YES
     1
     sinktheyacht
     ```
   - The program correctly outputs "YES" and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.

2. **Test Case: "lllllllll"**
   - Expected Output: 
     ```
     NO
     ```
   - The program correctly outputs "NO" because all characters are the same.

3. **Test Case: "uwuowouwu"**
   - Expected Output: 
     ```
     YES
     3
     uw uow ouwu
     ```
   - The program incorrectly outputs "YES" and "1" instead of "3" and the correct partition.

### Conclusion:

The program fails to correctly handle the general case where the string can be split into multiple non-palindromic substrings. It only checks for the first pair of different characters and does not ensure that the rest of the string can be split correctly. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
