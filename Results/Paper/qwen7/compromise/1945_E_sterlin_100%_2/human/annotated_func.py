def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no direct parameters and relies on user input to return an integer value. After executing, the program will have returned an integer input provided by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. Each test case consists of n and x where 1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and p is a list of n integers representing a permutation of size n.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers parsed from user input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input, converts each integer to a string, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. Each test case consists of n and x where 1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of two integers, where the first integer is n (the number of elements in the permutation) and the second integer is x (an integer between 1 and n).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the user, which includes an integer t, followed by two integers n and x, and a permutation of integers from 1 to n. It then returns a list containing these two integers: the first integer is n (the number of elements in the permutation), and the second integer is x (an integer between 1 and n).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and x, where 1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a permutation p of length n consisting of distinct integers from 1 to n.
def func_4():
    return input()
    #The program returns a string containing the next test case's values of n, x, and the permutation p as a space-separated list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, extracting the values of \(n\), \(x\), and the permutation \(p\) for each case. It returns a string containing these values for the next test case as a space-separated list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a permutation p of length n consisting of distinct integers from 1 to n.
def func_5():

    #The program returns a list of strings containing two integers n and x, and a permutation p of length n consisting of distinct integers from 1 to n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an external input consisting of an integer t, followed by t test cases. Each test case includes two integers n and x, and a permutation p of length n consisting of distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns a list of strings, where each string contains two integers n and x, and a permutation p of length n consisting of distinct integers from 1 to n.
