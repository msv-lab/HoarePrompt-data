Reasoning:
1. **Function Definitions**: The provided functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` do not match the expected behavior for solving the problem. Specifically, `func_2` and `func_3` should return a tuple `(n, x)` and a list `p` respectively, rather than returning a map object or a list of two integers. Also, `func_4` and `func_5` are not defined in the provided code snippet.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The provided code attempts to perform a binary search on the permutation `p`. However, the logic for finding the correct indices to swap is flawed. The code does not correctly handle the case where the element `x` is not found in the initial permutation and needs to be swapped into position.

3. **Swapping Logic**: The code incorrectly uses a `seen` list to track whether an element has been visited. This is unnecessary for the problem and complicates the solution. Additionally, the logic for determining which elements to swap is not correct. The code tries to find the smallest and largest unused indices, but it does not ensure that the correct element is moved to the correct position.

4. **Output Format**: The code prints the number of swaps and the indices to be swapped, but the logic for determining these indices is incorrect. The provided code does not guarantee that the correct element will be moved to the position where `x` should be.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
