Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality. The program only defines several utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) without actually solving the problem described. These functions are meant to read input from stdin, but they do not contain the logic to rearrange the permutation and perform the binary search as specified.

To meet the problem description, the program should:
1. Read the input values for `n` and `x`.
2. Read the permutation `p`.
3. Rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps to ensure that `p_l` (where `l` is the index found by the binary search) is equal to `x`.
4. Perform the binary search to find the index of `x` in the rearranged permutation.

Since the provided code does not contain any of these steps, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
