Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions defined (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) are placeholders for reading input but do not contain the actual logic to solve the problem.

To solve the problem, you would need to:
1. Read the input values.
2. Identify the position of the target value \(x\) in the permutation.
3. Perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that the target value \(x\) is in the first position before performing the binary search.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def solve():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the index of x in the permutation
        idx_x = p.index(x)
        
        # If x is already at the first position, no swaps needed
        if idx_x == 0:
            results.append(0)
            continue
        
        # If x is at the last position, swap it with the first element
        if idx_x == n - 1:
            results.append(2)
            results.append((1, n))
            results.append((idx_x + 1, n))
            continue
        
        # Otherwise, find the smallest element greater than x and swap it with x
        for i in range(idx_x + 1, n):
            if p[i] > x:
                results.append(1)
                results.append((idx_x + 1, i + 1))
                break
        
        # Swap x to the first position
        results.append(1)
        results.append((1, idx_x + 1))
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        if res > 0:
            for _ in range(res):
                i, j = map(int, input().split())
                # Perform the swap
                p[i-1], p[j-1] = p[j-1], p[i-1]
            print(' '.join(map(str, p[:2])))
```

This solution reads the input, finds the target value \(x\) in the permutation, and performs at most 2 swaps to bring \(x\) to the first position. It then prints the number of swaps and the swaps themselves.
