Output State: **`j` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string obtained from the input, `b` is a string input by the user, `k` is 0.**

The code simply initializes `j` to 0. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
