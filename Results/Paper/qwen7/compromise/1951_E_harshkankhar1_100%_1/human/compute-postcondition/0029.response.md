Functionality: **The function reads an input string `s` and checks if there is a specific pattern within the string based on certain conditions. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES' followed by either 1 or 2 and the relevant substrings of `s`. If the conditions are not met, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.**
