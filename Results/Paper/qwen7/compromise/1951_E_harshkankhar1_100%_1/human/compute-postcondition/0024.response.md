Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is an input string.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from the first character of `s`.
- `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to half the length of `s`.
- `func_1(s[0:])` is True, meaning the function `func_1` returns `True` when applied to the entire string `s`.
- `x` is not equal to -1, ensuring that `x` is a valid index.
- `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True, meaning the function `func_1` returns `True` when applied to the substring starting from index `x + 1`.

The `print(2)` statement directly outputs the number 2 without referencing any of the variables `s`, `n`, `x`, or the results of `func_1`.

Output: **2**
