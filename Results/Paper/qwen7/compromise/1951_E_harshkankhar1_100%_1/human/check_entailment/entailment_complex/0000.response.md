### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly checks whether a given string `s` is a palindrome.
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads an input string `s`.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s)`.
     - If `s` is a palindrome (`func_1(s)` returns `True`), it immediately prints "YES", "1", and `s`, which is correct because a single non-palindromic substring can be formed by splitting the string at any point.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome (`func_1(s)` returns `False`), it proceeds to find the first character in `s` that is different from the first character.
       - If no such character is found (`x == -1`), it prints "NO", which is correct because there is no way to split the string into non-palindromic substrings.
       - If such a character is found, it checks if the substring starting from this character is a palindrome (`func_1(s[x + 1:])`).
         - If the substring is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", "2", and the two substrings split at this point, which is correct.
         - If the substring is a palindrome, it further checks specific conditions (e.g., `x == 1` or `x == n // 2`) and splits the string accordingly.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2()` which handles the logic described above.
   - The output matches the problem statement requirements:
     - "YES" with the number of parts and the corresponding substrings if a valid partition exists.
     - "NO" if no valid partition exists.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and outputs the results as specified.

**Correctness: **True**
