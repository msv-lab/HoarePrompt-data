### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads an input string `s` and attempts to partition it into non-palindromic substrings.
   - The function first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single partition.
     - Otherwise, it iterates through the string to find the first character that differs from the first character.
     - If no such character is found, it means the string is a palindrome, so it prints "NO".
     - If a differing character is found, it splits the string at that point and checks if the second part is a palindrome.
       - If the second part is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" with the two-part partition.
       - If the second part is a palindrome and the split is at the beginning or middle of the string, it prints "NO".
       - Otherwise, it prints "YES" with the two-part partition.

### Analysis:

- The function correctly identifies if the entire string is a palindrome.
- When the entire string is not a palindrome, it correctly outputs "YES" and the string itself as a single partition.
- When the entire string is a palindrome, it correctly outputs "NO".
- When the string can be split into two non-palindromic parts, it correctly outputs "YES" and the appropriate partitions.
- However, the function has a flaw in handling the case where the string can be split into more than two non-palindromic parts. The current logic only checks for a two-part split and does not consider other possible partitions.

### Example Counter-Case:

Consider the input string `s = "aabaa"`:
- The entire string is a palindrome.
- The function will check for the first differing character, which is at index 1 ('a' vs 'b').
- It will split the string at index 1, resulting in `["aa", "baa"]`.
- Both "aa" and "baa" are not palindromes, so the function should print "YES" and the two-part partition.
- However, the function incorrectly prints "NO" because it only checks for a two-part split and does not consider other possible partitions.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_2` correctly handles the cases where the string can be split into exactly two non-palindromic parts, but it fails to handle cases where the string can be split into more than two non-palindromic parts.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
