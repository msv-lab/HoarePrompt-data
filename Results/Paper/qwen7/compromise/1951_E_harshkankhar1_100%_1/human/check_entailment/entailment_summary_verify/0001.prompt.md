You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(s) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    s = input()
    (n, x) = (len(s), -1)
    if func_1(s[0:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
    if x == -1:
        print('NO')
        return
    if func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
    elif x == 1 or x == n // 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads an input string `s` and checks if there is a specific pattern within the string based on certain conditions. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES' followed by either 1 or 2 and the relevant substrings of `s`. If the conditions are not met, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome.
   - It returns `True` if `s` is equal to its reverse (`s[::-1]`), otherwise `False`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to partition the string `s` into non-palindromic substrings.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single partition.
     - Otherwise, it iterates through the string to find the first character that differs from the first character.
     - If no such character is found, it means the string is a palindrome, so it prints "NO".
     - If a differing character is found, it splits the string at that point and checks if the second part is a palindrome.
       - If the second part is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" with the two-part partition.
       - If the second part is a palindrome and the split is at the beginning or middle of the string, it prints "NO".
       - Otherwise, it prints "YES" with the two-part partition.

### Analysis:

- The function correctly identifies if the entire string is a palindrome.
- When the entire string is not a palindrome, it correctly outputs "YES" and the string itself as a single partition.
- When the entire string is a palindrome, it correctly outputs "NO".
- When the string can be split into two non-palindromic parts, it correctly outputs "YES" and the appropriate partitions.
- The logic handles edge cases like splitting at the beginning or middle of the string correctly.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_2` correctly implements the required logic to determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and outputs the correct results according to the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
