Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and logic. Specifically, the program does not handle the turns of Alice and Bob correctly. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Turn Handling**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as described. Instead, it sorts the array and tries to find the MEX based on the sorted array, which does not reflect the game's turn-based nature.

2. **Alice's Turn**: In the game, Alice picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and removes it from `a`. The program does not simulate this process.

3. **Bob's Turn**: Bob picks an element from `a` and removes it without appending it to `c`. The program does not simulate this either.

4. **Optimal Strategy**: The program attempts to find the MEX directly from the sorted array, which does not consider the optimal strategies of both players. For example, in the first test case, the optimal strategy would involve Alice picking elements in such a way that maximizes the MEX, and Bob minimizing it.

Here is an example where the program fails to produce the correct output:

Consider the input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
1
0
```

However, the program outputs:
```
2
1
0
```

This is correct for the given examples, but the program does not correctly simulate the game's turns and does not handle the optimal strategies of both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
