Output State: **`N` must have at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is `cur` + 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are inside. The values of `N`, `num`, and `cur` remain unchanged from their initial states.
