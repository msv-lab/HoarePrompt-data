Postcondition: `cur` is -1, `i` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `M` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the last element of `N`, and if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
