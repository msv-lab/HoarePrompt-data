Output State: **`i` is `cur + 1`, `cur` is `i`, `S` remains unchanged, and the current value of `M[i]` (which is `M[cur + 1]`) is less than or equal to `cur + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `cur = i` assigns the value of `i` to `cur`. The value of `i` was originally `cur + 1`, so now `cur` is also `cur + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
