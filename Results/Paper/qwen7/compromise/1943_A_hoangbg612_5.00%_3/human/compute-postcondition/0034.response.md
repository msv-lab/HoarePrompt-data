Output State: **`N` must have at least one element (one less than before), `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is equal to `num`, and `M[cur]` is updated to 1 if `num > cur`, otherwise `M[cur]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
