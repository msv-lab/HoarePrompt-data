Output State: **`cur` is equal to `i`, and the current value of `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, it does not change the values of `cur` or `M[i]`, but it indicates that the program has broken out of the loop or conditional structure it was in. Therefore, the values of `cur` and `M[i]` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the loop or conditional structure.
