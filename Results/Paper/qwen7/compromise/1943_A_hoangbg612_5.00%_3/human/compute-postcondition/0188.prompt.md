Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2⋅10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    S = int(input())
    N = list(map(int, input().split()))
    N.sort()
    cur = -1
    M = {}
    for num in N:
        if num > cur:
            if num > cur + 1:
                cur += 1
                break
            cur = num
            M[cur] = 1
        else:
            M[cur] += 1
    if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
        cur += 1
    for i in range(cur):
        if M[i] <= i:
            cur = i
            break
    print(cur)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: cur is greater than or equal to the length of N, and i is the value of cur minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All entries in `M` are either 0 or 1, with exactly `len(N)` ones in total. `cur` is equal to `len(N)`. `i` is equal to `len(N) - 1`. `S` is equal to `len(N)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All values in `M` are either 1 (if the key is greater than `cur`) or incremented by the count of occurrences in `N` (if the key is less than or equal to `cur`). `cur` is the maximum value in `N` that satisfies the condition `num > cur`, or the second-highest number plus one if the highest number does not satisfy the condition. `i` is 0 since the loop has completed all its iterations. The sum of all values in `M` still equals `S`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
