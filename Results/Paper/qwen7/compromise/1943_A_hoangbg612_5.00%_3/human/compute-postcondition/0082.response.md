Output State: **`cur` is increased by 1, `N` must contain at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N`.**

The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. The other variables, `N` and `num`, remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `N` still must contain at least one element, and `num` is still the next element in `N`.
