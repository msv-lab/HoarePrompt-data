Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `cur` will be the maximum value in `N` that satisfies the condition `num > cur`, or the second-highest number plus one if the highest number does not satisfy the condition. All values in `M` will be either 1 (if the key is greater than `cur`) or will be the count of occurrences of numbers less than or equal to `cur` in `N`. The sum of all values in `M` will still equal `S`. `i` will be 0 since the loop has completed all its iterations.**

This means that after all iterations, `cur` will reflect the highest valid value found during the process, and `M` will contain counts of how many times each number appeared up to `cur`. The value of `i` will be 0 as the loop has finished executing.
