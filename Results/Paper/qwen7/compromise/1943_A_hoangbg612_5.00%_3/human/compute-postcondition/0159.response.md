Postcondition: `cur` is either the second-to-last element of `N` or -1, `i` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces (now including its last element), `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value either `1` or `2`, and `num` is the last element of `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` is not greater than `cur + 1`, the conditions remain as they were before the if-else block executes.
