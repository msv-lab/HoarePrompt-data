Output State: **`num` is greater than `cur + 1`; `cur` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. Since the initial condition was that `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, this condition remains true after the assignment because `cur` now equals `num`. Therefore, the updated state includes that `cur` is now equal to `num`, and the original condition that `num` is greater than `cur + 1` still holds true.
