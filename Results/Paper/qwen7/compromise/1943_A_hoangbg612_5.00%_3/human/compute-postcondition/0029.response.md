Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `num` and `N`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `N` to iterate over.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `N` must have at least one element.
   - `num` is the next element in `N`.
   - `cur` is either the same as the previous `cur` or the new `num` if the condition is met.
   - `M[cur]` is updated to 1 if `num > cur`, otherwise `M[cur]` is increased by 1.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the next element in `N`, it means `N` had at least one element, and now `N` will have one less element because `num` has been processed.
   - `cur` could either remain the same as the previous value or change to the current `num` based on the condition in the loop body.
   - `M[cur]` will be updated according to the condition in the loop body, but this update does not affect the loop continuation condition.

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `N` must have at least one element (it will have one less element than before).
   - `num` will be the next element in `N`.
   - `cur` will either be the same as the previous `cur` or the new `num` if the condition is met.
   - `M[cur]` will be updated accordingly, but this does not affect the loop continuation condition.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `N` has one less element, `num` is the next element in `N`, and `cur` and `M[cur]` are updated based on the condition in the loop body.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`N` must have at least one element (one less than before), `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is either the same as the previous `cur` or the new `num` if the condition is met, and `M[cur]` is updated to 1 if `num > cur`, otherwise `M[cur]` is increased by 1**.
