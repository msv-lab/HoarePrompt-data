Output State: **`num` is greater than `cur + 1`; `cur` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. This means that `cur` now holds the same value as `num`. The condition specified in the initial state (if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur` is incremented by 1 and the loop or if statement is exited) is not directly impacted by this assignment, as the assignment itself does not change the values of `num` or `cur` relative to each other. Therefore, the condition remains the same, and the output state reflects that `cur` is now equal to `num`.
