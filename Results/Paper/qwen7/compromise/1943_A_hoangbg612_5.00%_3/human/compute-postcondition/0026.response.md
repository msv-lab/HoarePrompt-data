Output State: **`N` must have at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is either the same as the previous `cur` or the new `num` if the condition is met, and `M[cur]` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `M[cur]` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `N`, `num`, and `cur` remain as they were in the initial state, with `cur` potentially updating to `num` if the specified condition was met.
