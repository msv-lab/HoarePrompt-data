Output State: The final output state will be such that `cur` will be the maximum value present in the list `N`, and `M[cur]` will be 1. All other values in `N` that are less than or equal to `cur` will have their counts accumulated in `M[cur]`. For any value in `N` that is greater than `cur`, it will not update `cur` but will increment the count of `cur` in `M`.

In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations, `cur` will hold the highest value found in the list `N`. The dictionary `M` will contain `cur` with a count of 1, and for all other values in `N` that are less than or equal to `cur`, their counts in `M` will be incremented appropriately based on whether they are exactly `cur` or less than `cur`. Values in `N` that are greater than `cur` will not be present in `M` since the loop does not update `cur` for such values.
