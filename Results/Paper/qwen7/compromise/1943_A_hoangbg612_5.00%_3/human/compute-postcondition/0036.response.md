Output State: **`N` must have at least one element (one less than before), `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is either the same as the previous `cur` or the new `num` if the condition is met, and `M[cur]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. The conditions and relationships between the variables `N`, `num`, and `cur` remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is that `M[cur]` is increased by 1.
