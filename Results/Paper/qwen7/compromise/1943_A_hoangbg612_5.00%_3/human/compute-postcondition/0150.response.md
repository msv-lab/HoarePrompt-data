Postcondition: `cur` is 0, `i` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces without its last element, `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`, and `num` is the second-to-last element of `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
