To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions given:

1. **M**: All values in `M` are either 1 (if the key is greater than `cur`) or incremented by the count of occurrences in `N` (if the key is less than or equal to `cur`).
2. **cur**: 
   - It is the maximum value in `N` that satisfies the condition `num > cur`.
   - If no such value exists, it is the second-highest number in `N` plus one.
3. **i**: This variable is 0 because the loop has completed all its iterations.
4. **S**: The sum of all values in `M` still equals `S`.

Given these conditions, we need to focus on `cur` to determine what will be printed.

### Determining `cur`:
- `cur` is defined as the maximum value in `N` that satisfies the condition `num > cur`.
- If no such value exists, `cur` is the second-highest number in `N` plus one.

Since the exact values of `N` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `cur`. However, we know that `cur` is derived from the values in `N` according to the specified rules.

### Conclusion:
The `print(cur)` statement will output the value of `cur`, which is determined by the conditions described above.

Output: **cur (where cur is the maximum value in N that satisfies the condition num > cur, or the second-highest number in N plus one if no such value exists)**
