Output State: **`cur` is -1, `i` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`, `num` is the last element of `N`, and `num` is less than or equal to -1**.

Explanation: The line `M[cur] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. Since `cur` is `-1`, the dictionary `M` now has a key `-1` with a value of `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
