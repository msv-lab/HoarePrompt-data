Postcondition: **`cur` is the maximum value in `N` or the second-to-last element of `N` plus 1 if the last element is not greater than `cur`, `i` is 1 if the last element of `N` is greater than `cur`, otherwise `i` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `M` is a dictionary where the key is each unique value in `N` that is greater than `cur` and the value is 1, for all other keys in `N` that are less than or equal to `cur`, their values are incremented by the count of occurrences in `N`, and the sum of all values in `M` is equal to `S`.**
