Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and the variable `cur`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `cur` is the maximum value in the original list `N`.
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `cur`.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, it will start the loop.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `cur`. Therefore, `i` should be set to 0 initially, and `cur` should be greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `cur`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cur` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
