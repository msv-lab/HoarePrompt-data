Output State: **`cur` is now equal to `num`, `N` must contain at least one element, and `M[cur]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `num` is greater than `cur`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the current value of `cur` has been updated to be equal to `num`, while the conditions involving `N` and `M[cur]` remain unchanged from the initial state.
