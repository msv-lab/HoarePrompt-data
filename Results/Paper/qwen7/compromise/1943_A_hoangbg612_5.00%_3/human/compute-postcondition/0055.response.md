Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cur` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` in the range `range(cur)`.
   - This means the loop will run as long as `i < cur`.

3. **Current Value of Variables:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `cur`.

4. **Condition to Continue the Loop:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < cur`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `cur` must be greater than 1.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is incremented within the loop (though not shown explicitly in the example), it will become 2 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `cur` must still be greater than 1.
   - After the next increment, `i` will be 2, so `cur` must be greater than 2 to allow the loop to continue.

6. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - `i` will be 2 after the next iteration.
   - `cur` must be greater than 2 to allow the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`cur` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
