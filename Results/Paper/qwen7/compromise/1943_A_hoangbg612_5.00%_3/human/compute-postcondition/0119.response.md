Output State: **`i` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is `cur + 1`, `S` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement where the condition `M[cur]` is less than or equal to `cur`. The values of `i`, `cur`, and `S` remain unchanged after executing the `break` statement.
