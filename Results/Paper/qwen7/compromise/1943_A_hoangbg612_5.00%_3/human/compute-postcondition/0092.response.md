Output State: **`cur` is the next element in `N` which is `cur + 1`, `N` must contain at least one element, and `M[cur]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `num` is greater than `cur`.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Since `cur` was initially the next element in `N`, after executing the code, `cur` will now be the next element in `N`, which is `cur + 1`. The conditions for `M[cur]` (whether it is incremented by 1 or set to 1) based on the comparison with `num` remain unchanged.
