Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` and the iterable `palka`.

2. **Understand the postconditions from the previous iteration**:
   - `palka` contains at least one element.
   - `i` is the next element in `palka`.
   - `d[i]` is now set to 1 if it was `None`, or incremented by 1 if it had a previous value.
   - `pl` is a list containing the element `i`.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `palka`, after processing `i`, the next element in `palka` will be the one that follows `i`.
   - `d[i]` will be updated based on its previous value (either 1 or incremented).
   - `pl` will be updated to include the next element in `palka`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `palka` will now contain all elements except the first one (since `i` was the first element processed).
- `i` will be the next element in `palka`.
- `d[i]` will be updated as per the rules mentioned.
- `pl` will be updated to include the next element in `palka`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`palka` contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `palka`, `d[i]` is now set to 1 if it was `None`, or incremented by 1 if it had a previous value, and `pl` is a list containing the next element in `palka`**.

To be more specific:

State: **`palka` contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `palka`, `d[i]` is now set to 1 if it was `None`, or incremented by 1 if it had a previous value, and `pl` is a list containing the next element in `palka`**.
