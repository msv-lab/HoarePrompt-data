Output State: **`palka` contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `palka`, `d[i]` is either set to 1 if it was `None`, or incremented by 1 if it had a previous value, and `pl` is a list containing the next element in `palka` appended to itself.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `i` is the next element in `palka`, `pl` now contains this element. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
