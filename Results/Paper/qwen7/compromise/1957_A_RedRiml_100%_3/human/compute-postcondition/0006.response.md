Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in palka:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `palka`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `palka` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
   - `i` is the variable used to iterate over the elements of `palka`.

3. **Conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `palka` must contain at least one element. This ensures there is something to iterate over.

4. **Initial values of other variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `w` must be greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `ln` is an input integer.
   - `palka` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
   - `pl` is an empty list.
   - `d` is an empty dictionary.

5. **Adjusting the states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `palka`, we need to ensure `palka` contains at least one element.
   - The other variables (`t`, `w`, `_`, `ln`, `pl`, `d`) do not directly affect the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `palka` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`palka` must contain at least one element**
