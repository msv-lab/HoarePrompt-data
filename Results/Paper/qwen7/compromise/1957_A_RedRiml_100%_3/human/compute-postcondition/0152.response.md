Output State: **`shapes` is 2, `j` is 2**

Explanation: Initially, `shapes` is calculated as \(0 + d[1] // 3\). Given that `j` is 2, the value of `d[1]` is used to compute `shapes`. After the computation, `shapes` is updated by adding `d[j] // 3`, which is equivalent to `d[2] // 3`. Since the initial value of `shapes` was based on `d[1]`, and now it is being updated by `d[2]`, the new value of `shapes` is the sum of these two divisions. Given the initial state, `shapes` was `d[1] // 3`, and after the operation, it becomes `shapes + d[2] // 3`. Since `j` remains unchanged, its value is still 2.
