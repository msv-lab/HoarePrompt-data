Output State: **`shapes` is 0 + d[1] // 3, `j` is 1**

Explanation: The code `shapes += d[j] // 3` increments the value of `shapes` by the integer division of `d[j]` by 3. Given that `j` is 1 and `d[j]` (which is `d[1]`) is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is updated to its original value plus the result of `d[1] // 3`. The value of `j` remains unchanged. The precondition that `pl` must have at least 1 element is still valid, but since no operations were performed on `pl`, its state remains unchanged.
