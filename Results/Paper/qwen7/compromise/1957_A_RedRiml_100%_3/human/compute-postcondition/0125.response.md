Output State: **`palka` is a non-empty list of integers, and `d` is a dictionary. The key `i` is now in the dictionary `d`; if `d.get(i)` was `None`, then `d[i]` is set to 1, otherwise `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `palka`. Since `i` was not previously in the dictionary `d`, the postcondition ensures that if `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d[i]` is set to 1, or if `d.get(i)` was not `None`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `palka` being a non-empty list of integers and `d` being a dictionary with the key `i` not present remains unchanged except for the modifications to `d` as per the postcondition.
