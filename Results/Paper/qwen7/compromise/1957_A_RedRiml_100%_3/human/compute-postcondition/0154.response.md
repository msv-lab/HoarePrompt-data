Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in pl`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `pl`.

2. **Determine the Initial States**:
   - `shapes` is 2 (this value does not change).
   - `j` is 2 (this value does not change).

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is based on the variable `j` iterating over the sequence `pl`. Since `j` is set to 2 and it does not change, the loop will only execute once if `2` is in the sequence `pl`.

4. **Check the Sequence `pl`**:
   - If `pl` contains the value `2`, then the loop will execute once.
   - If `pl` does not contain the value `2`, the loop will not execute.

5. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is fixed at 2 and does not change, it remains `2`.
   - The sequence `pl` must include the value `2` for the loop to execute again.

Given that the loop body is omitted, we only need to consider the loop head variables. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted based on whether `2` is in `pl` or not.

**State:**
- If `pl` contains the value `2`, then `j` is `2` and `pl` must contain the value `2`.
- If `pl` does not contain the value `2`, then the loop will not execute again.

Since the problem does not specify the exact contents of `pl`, we assume the loop needs to execute one more time for the sake of answering the question.

State: **`shapes` is 2, `j` is 2, `pl` must contain the value 2**
