Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ln` is an input integer, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `d` is an empty dictionary, `pl` is an empty list, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from input, `_` is incremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `palka` is a non-empty list of integers, and `d` is a dictionary. If the key `i` is not in the dictionary `d`, then `d[i]` is set to 1. If the key `i` is already in the dictionary `d`, then `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `palka` is a non-empty list of integers, and `d` is a dictionary. For each integer `i` from `palka`, if `i` is not in `d`, then `d[i]` is set to 1. If `i` is already in `d`, then `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `palka` is a non-empty list of integers, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `d[i]` is set to `1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
