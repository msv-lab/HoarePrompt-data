Output State: **`d` is a dictionary where `d.get(i)` was `None` before and now `d[i]` is set to 1, `palka` has at least one element.**

The code `d[i] = 1` sets the value of the key `i` in dictionary `d` to `1`. Since `d.get(i)` was `None` initially, this assignment changes its value to `1`. The precondition that `palka` must have at least one element remains unchanged.
