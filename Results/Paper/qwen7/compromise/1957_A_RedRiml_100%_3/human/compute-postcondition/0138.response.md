Output State: **`palka` is a non-empty list of integers; `d` is a dictionary; `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. Since `i` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `d[i]`, but we know it has been incremented. The state of `palka` remains unchanged, and `d` now has its value at key `i` incremented by 1.
