Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `i`, and it iterates over the sequence `palka`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, we know that if `i` is not in `pl`, then `d[i]` is set to 1. If `i` is already in `d`, then `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**: We need to consider the possible changes to the states of `d` and `pl` based on the loop condition. However, since the loop head does not directly modify `d` or `pl`, the only state that needs adjustment is `i`.

4. **Next iteration condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in the sequence `palka`.

5. **Initial states**: At the end of the previous iteration, `d` is a dictionary, `pl` is a list, and `i` is some value from `palka`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is `i` to be the next element in `palka`.

**Answer**:
State: **`d` is a dictionary, `pl` is a list, and `i` is the next element in `palka`**
