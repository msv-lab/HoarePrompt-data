Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `shapes` is 0, `d` is a dictionary where the count of each element in `palka` is stored, and `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += d[j] // 3


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `shapes` is either 0 + `d[j]` // 3, or 0, `d` is a dictionary where the count of each element in `palka` is stored, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered and must have at least one element, and `j` is such that `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `shapes` is either 0 + (d[j] // 3) or 0, `d` is a dictionary where the count of each element in `palka` is stored, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered, and `j` is such that `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, but `j` will be the next element in `pl` that satisfies this condition and `pl` will be updated to exclude the current `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `shapes` is either 0 + (d[j] // 3) or 0, `d` is a dictionary where the count of each element in `palka` is stored, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered excluding the current `j`, and `j` is the next element in the updated `pl` that satisfies d[j] >= 3. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is set to 0 + (d[j] // 3); otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
