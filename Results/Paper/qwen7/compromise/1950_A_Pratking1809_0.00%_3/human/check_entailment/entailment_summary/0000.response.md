Reasoning:
- The provided program attempts to solve the problem by reading the number of test cases `q` and then processing each test case individually.
- For each test case, the program correctly checks if the digits form a stair (`a < b < c`) and prints "STAIR".
- It also correctly checks if the digits form a peak (`a < b > c`) and prints "PEAK".
- If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".
- However, there is an issue with the logic. The variables `mn` and its initialization are not used in the program, which suggests that this part of the code might be a leftover from a previous implementation attempt.
- Despite the unused variable, the current logic correctly implements the conditions for determining whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither.

Given the above reasoning, the program logic is correct and will produce the expected output based on the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
