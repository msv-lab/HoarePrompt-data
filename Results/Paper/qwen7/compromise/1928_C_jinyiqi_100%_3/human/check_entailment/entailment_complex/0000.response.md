Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values for \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit into the described settling pattern.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - The positions are filled in cycles of \( k \) (with decreasing numbers) and then \( k-2 \) (with increasing numbers).
   - The key is to find \( k \) such that the position \( n \) and the number \( x \) fit into this pattern.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It checks conditions involving \( n \) and \( x \) to determine possible values of \( k \).
   - The function `func_1` is intended to find all divisors of a number \( x \) and return them in a specific order.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function calculates all divisors of \( x \) and returns them in a specific order: first the quotients of divisors greater than or equal to the square root of \( x \), then the reverse of the divisors less than the square root of \( x \).
   - This is a correct approach to finding all divisors of \( x \).

5. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - The main logic correctly uses the divisors found by `func_1` to check if they can form a valid \( k \) that fits the given \( n \) and \( x \).
   - The conditions used to filter valid \( k \) values are correct based on the problem statement.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where no valid \( k \) exists, returning 0 as expected.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
