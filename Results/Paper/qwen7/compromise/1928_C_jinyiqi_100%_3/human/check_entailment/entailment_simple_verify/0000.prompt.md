You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

    #State: The loop will continue to iterate as long as `i` (which starts from 2 and increments by 1 each iteration) is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. Once `i` exceeds the square root of `x`, the loop will terminate. `output1` will contain all divisors of `x` starting from 1 up to the largest divisor less than or equal to the square root of `x`. `output2` will contain the corresponding quotients for each divisor in `output1`.
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a string that is the concatenation of 'output2' followed by the reversed version of 'output1'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of possible values for \( k \). Specifically, the function `func_1` is used to find divisors of a number, but the logic for determining valid \( k \) values is flawed.

Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of \( k \)**:
   - The program checks if \((n + x - 2)\) and \((n - x)\) are even. If they are, it proceeds to find divisors using `func_1`.
   - However, the logic for determining valid \( k \) values from these divisors is incorrect. The condition \(((s + 2) / 2) >= x\) is not sufficient to ensure that the divisor \( s \) corresponds to a valid \( k \).

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the test case \( n = 10 \) and \( x = 2 \).
     - \((n + x - 2) = 10\), which is even.
     - Divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10.
     - The program would consider these divisors and check if \(((s + 2) / 2) >= x\).
     - For \( s = 10 \), \(((10 + 2) / 2) = 6\), which is greater than or equal to 2. So, \( k = 10 \) is incorrectly considered.
     - For \( s = 5 \), \(((5 + 2) / 2) = 3.5\), which is not an integer and thus invalid.
     - For \( s = 2 \), \(((2 + 2) / 2) = 2\), which is valid.
     - For \( s = 1 \), \(((1 + 2) / 2) = 1.5\), which is not an integer and thus invalid.
   - The program should only consider even divisors greater than or equal to \( x \), but it incorrectly includes odd divisors.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly determine the number of valid \( k \) values for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
