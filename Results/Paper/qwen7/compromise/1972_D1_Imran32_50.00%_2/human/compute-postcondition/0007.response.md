Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each `t`, two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6) are processed. The function returns a result based on the conditions given for `n` and `m` for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` followed by pairs of integers `n` and `m`. For each pair of `n` and `m`, the function evaluates certain conditions and returns a result accordingly. However, since the function definition itself does not explicitly show the processing logic, the focus here is on the input structure implied by the constraints.
