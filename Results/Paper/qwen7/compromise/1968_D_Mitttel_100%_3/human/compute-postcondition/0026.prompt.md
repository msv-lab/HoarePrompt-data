You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the array a, p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, s is a list of integers representing the starting positions (P_B, P_S) for Bodya and Sasha, and k is a positive integer representing the duration of the game.
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    #State: Output State: `k` is 0, `mx` is the maximum value encountered during the loop (i.e., the maximum of `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]` for each iteration), `cur` is the final value of `cur` after the last iteration (i.e., `cur + a[s]` for the last iteration), `vis[s]` is 1, and `s` is updated to `p[s]` for the last iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `k` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `mx` will hold the highest value between its previous value and `cur + k * a[s]` for each iteration. `cur` will be the final value it takes after the last iteration, which is `cur + a[s]`. `vis[s]` will be marked as 1 because it is set to 1 in the first line of the loop. Finally, `s` will be updated to `p[s]` for the last iteration, meaning it will hold the value of `p[s]` after the loop ends.
    return mx
    #The program returns the maximum value between `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]` for each iteration, with `k` being 0, `cur` holding the final value after the last iteration (`cur + a[s]`), `vis[s]` marked as 1, and `s` holding the value of `p[s]` after the loop ends.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: a list of integers `a`, a permutation of integers `p`, a list of integers `s`, and a positive integer `k`. It returns the maximum value between `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]` for each iteration, where `cur` holds the final value after the last iteration (`cur + a[s]`), `vis[s]` is marked as 1, and `s` is updated to `p[s]` after the loop ends.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum value between `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]` for each iteration, with `k` being 0, `cur` holding the final value after the last iteration (`cur + a[s]`), `vis[s]` marked as 1, and `s` holding the value of `p[s]` after the loop ends.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
