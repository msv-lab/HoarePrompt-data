Output State: **`mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`, `vis[s]` is 1, `cur` is increased by `a[s]`.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by the value of `a[s]`. The values of `mx` and `vis[s]` remain as they were in the initial state, with `mx` being updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`.
