The loop condition is `not vis[s] and k > 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true:

1. `vis[s]` must be false.
2. `k` must be greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`.
- `vis[s]` is 1 (which means `vis[s]` is true).
- `cur` is increased by `a[s]`.
- `k` is decreased by 1.
- `s` is updated to `p[s]`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `vis[s]` to be false and ensure `k` is greater than 0.

State: **`mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`, `vis[s]` is 0, `cur` is increased by `a[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1, `s` is updated to `p[s]`.**
