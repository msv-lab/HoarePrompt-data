Output State: **`mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`, `vis[s]` is 1, `cur` is increased by `a[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1, `s` is updated to `p[s]`.**

This means that the variable `s` has been updated to the value of `p[s]`, while the values of `mx`, `vis[s]`, `cur`, and `k` remain as described in the initial state but with the changes applied.
