Output State: **`vis[s]` is 1, `mx` is the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`, `cur` is equal to `cur + a[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1, `s` is updated to `p[s]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = p[s]` updates the value of `s` to `p[s]`. All other variables (`vis[s]`, `mx`, `cur`, `k`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
