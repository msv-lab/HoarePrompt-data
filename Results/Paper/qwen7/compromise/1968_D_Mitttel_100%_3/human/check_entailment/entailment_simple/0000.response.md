Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation**: The program correctly parses the input and prepares the necessary variables. It adjusts the indices of the arrays `a` and `p` by subtracting 1, which is important since indices in Python start at 0.

2. **Function Call and Logic**: The program calls the `func_1` function for both Bodya and Sasha, using their respective starting positions. This function is designed to calculate the maximum possible score for a given starting position over `k` turns.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes variables `mx`, `cur`, and `vis` to keep track of the maximum score, current score, and visited states, respectively.
   - It uses a while loop to simulate the game turns, ensuring that the starting position `s` is not visited again and that there are still turns left (`k > 0`).
   - Inside the loop, it updates `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`.
   - It increments the current score `cur` by `a[s]` and decrements the remaining turns `k` by 1.
   - It updates the position `s` to `p[s]` for the next iteration.
   - After the loop, it returns `mx`, which represents the maximum score achievable from the starting position `s`.

4. **Output Determination**: Based on the scores returned by `func_1` for Bodya and Sasha, the program correctly determines the winner or if it's a draw.

Given that the logic in the program aligns with the problem statement and the provided example, and the function `func_1` correctly simulates the game for a given starting position, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
