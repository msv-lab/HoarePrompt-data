Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bullets_used` is 0, `can_survive` is True
Code of the loop:
for pos, health in monsters:
    distance = abs(pos)
    total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
    if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
        can_survive = False
        break
    bullets_used += health


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bullets_used` is `health` of the first monster, `can_survive` is False, `monsters` is a non-empty list, `pos` is the position of the first monster in the list, `health` is the health of the first monster in the list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the first monster in the list, and `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bullets_used` is the sum of the health of the first and second monsters plus the health of the second monster, `can_survive` is False, `monsters` is a non-empty list without the first tuple, `pos` is the position of the second monster, `health` is the health of the second monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the second monster, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `can_survive` remains False, `monsters` is a non-empty list without the first two tuples, `pos` is the position of the next monster, `health` is the health of the next monster minus `bullets_used`, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the next monster.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
