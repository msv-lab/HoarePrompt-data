Postcondition: **`bullets_used` remains 0, `can_survive` is False, `monsters` is a non-empty list, `pos` is the position of the first monster in the list, `health` is the health of the first monster in the list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the first monster in the list, and `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
