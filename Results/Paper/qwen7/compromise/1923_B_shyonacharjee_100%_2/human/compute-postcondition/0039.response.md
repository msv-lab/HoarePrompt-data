Output State: **`bullets_used` is 0**

Explanation: The code sets `bullets_used` to 0. This initializes `bullets_used` to 0, which was previously the sum of all `health` values in the original `monsters` list. All other variables (`monsters`, `a`, `distance`, `total_bullets_needed`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
