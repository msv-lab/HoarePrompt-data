Output State: **`bullets_used` is the sum of the health of the first and second monsters plus the health of the second monster, `can_survive` is False, `monsters` is a non-empty list without the first two tuples, `pos` is the position of the next monster, `health` is the health of the next monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the next monster, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the next monster.**

In this case, the code simply updates the value of the `distance` variable to be the absolute value of the position of the next monster. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
