Output State: **`can_survive` is False, `monsters` is a non-empty list without the first two tuples, `pos` is the position of the next monster, `health` is the health of the next monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the next monster, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block that was checking the conditions for survival. The values of the other variables (`can_survive`, `monsters`, `pos`, `health`, `distance`, and `total_bullets_needed`) remain unchanged.
