Output State: **`bullets_used` is `health` more than its previous value, `monsters` is a list of tuples, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of `bullets_used` and `health`, and if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, then `can_survive` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.**

This means that the value of `bullets_used` has been incremented by `health`, while the other variables (`monsters`, `distance`, `total_bullets_needed`, `can_survive`, and `k`) remain in their original conditions unless `total_bullets_needed` exceeds `distance * k`, in which case `can_survive` would be set to `False`.
