Reasoning:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The solution checks only two specific conditions (whether the first row is identical to the last row or if the first and last characters of each row are the same) to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. However, these conditions are insufficient to cover all cases where it might be possible to make all squares the same color through the allowed operations.

The correct approach would involve checking if there exists a way to unify the colors by performing the allowed operations. The current solution fails to account for more complex scenarios where it might still be possible to make all squares the same color even if the first row is not identical to the last row and the first and last characters of each row are not the same.

Therefore, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
