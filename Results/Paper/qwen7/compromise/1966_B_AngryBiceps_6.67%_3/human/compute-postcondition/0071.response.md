Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `a` is a list with one element which is an input from the user.
   - `first_row` is updated by adding the first element of the only sublist in `a`.
   - `last_row` is updated by adding the last element of the last sublist in `a`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from `n + 1` and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` starts from `n + 1`, the loop will not execute on the first iteration because `i` will be `n + 1` and `n + 1` is not less than `n`.
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute at all based on the given initial states.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the loop does not execute, there are no changes needed in the states of `i`, `n`, `a`, `first_row`, or `last_row`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `n + 1`; `a` is a list with one element which is an input from the user; `first_row` is updated by adding the first element of the only sublist in `a`; `last_row` is updated by adding the last element of the last sublist in `a`.**
