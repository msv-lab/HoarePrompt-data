Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of size n Ã— m filled with 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters. For each test case, it checks if the first row is identical to the last row or if the first and last characters of each row are the same. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions checked.**
