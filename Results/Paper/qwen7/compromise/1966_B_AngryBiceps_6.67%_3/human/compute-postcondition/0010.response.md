Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list with two elements where the first element is an input from the user and the second element is another input from the user, `first_row` is the first element of the first element in list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the second element in list `a`**.

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends a new input from the user to the list `a`. Since `a` initially had one element (an input from the user), after appending another input, `a` now has two elements. The `first_row` remains the first element of the first element in list `a`, and `last_row` becomes the last element of the second element in list `a`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
