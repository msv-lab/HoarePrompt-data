Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-2`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `a` is a list with one element which is an input from the user
   - `first_row` is updated by adding the first element of the only element in the list `a`
   - `last_row` is updated by adding the last element of the last element in the list `a`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was `n-2` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `n-1`.
   - The value of `n` remains the same (greater than 0).

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` changes from `n-2` to `n-1`
   - `n` remains the same (greater than 0)
   - The lists `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are not affected by the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list with one element which is an input from the user, `first_row` is updated by adding the first element of the only element in the list `a`, `last_row` is updated by adding the last element of the last element in the list `a`**.
