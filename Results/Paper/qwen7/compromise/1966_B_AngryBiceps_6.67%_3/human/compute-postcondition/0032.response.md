Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being an input from the user, `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each input string in the list `a`, and `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each input string in the list `a`, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts these parts into integers, assigning them to `n` and `m` respectively. This changes the values of `n` and `m`, but does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.
