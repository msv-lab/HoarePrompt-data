Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list with two elements where the first element is an input from the user and the second element is another input from the user, `first_row` is the sum of the first element of the first element in list `a` and the first element of the second element in list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the second element in list `a` plus the last element of the last element in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` increments the value of `last_row` by the value of the last element of the last element in list `a`. Since `a` is a list with two elements, and each element is a list, `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last element of the second list within `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
