Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n`, where `n` is a positive integer.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user.
- `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in the list `a`.
- `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in the list `a` repeated according to its position in the list.
- Either the set of characters in `first_row` is not a singleton set or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
