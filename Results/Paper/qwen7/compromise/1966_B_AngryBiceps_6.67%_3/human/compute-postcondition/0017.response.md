Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being an input from the user, `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each input string in the list `a`, and `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each input string in the list `a`.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The list `a` will contain exactly `n` elements, each of which is an input provided by the user during the loop's execution. The string `first_row` will be constructed by taking the first character from each string in the list `a`, and the string `last_row` will be constructed by taking the last character from each string in the list `a`.
