Output State: **`n` is now `n+1`, `m` is an integer input from the user, `i` is `n+1`, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The line `last_row = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `last_row`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
