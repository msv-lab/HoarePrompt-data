Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a string, `k` is 0, `j` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
        j += 1
    if j < m:
        k += 1
        j += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is either equal to `m` or the index in `b` where an element matches `a[i]`, whichever comes first.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is incremented by 1 for each iteration until `i` is no longer within the bounds of `a`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 1 for the first iteration, then by 3 for the next two iterations and by 1 for each subsequent iteration, `j + 2` is less than `m`, and `b[j + 2]` is not equal to `a[i]`; `k` is incremented by 1 if the if condition is met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1 each time until it either meets or exceeds `m`, and `k` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `j` is no longer less than `m`, the loop breaks and the function exits.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
