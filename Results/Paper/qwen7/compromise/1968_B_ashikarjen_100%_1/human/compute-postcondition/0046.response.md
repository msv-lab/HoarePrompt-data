Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1 each time until it either meets or exceeds `m`, and throughout all these iterations, `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`; `k` is incremented by 1.**

In this scenario, the variable `k` is incremented by 1, while the conditions and values of `i`, `n`, `j`, and the relationship between `b[j]` and `a[i]` remain unchanged.
