Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, n is the first integer input split from input(), m is the second integer input split from input(), a is a string which is the input() result.**

Explanation: The code `a = input()` assigns the result of the `input()` function to the variable `a`. The `input()` function waits for user input and returns a string. Since `n` and `m` are defined as integers later (split from the input), they remain unchanged. The variable `t` remains unaffected as well.
