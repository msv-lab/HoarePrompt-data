Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is almost correct but has a small issue. The function `func_1` should be defined to take parameters to match the expected behavior of processing each test case. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not take any parameters. This means it won't work correctly when called within the main loop because it doesn't receive the necessary inputs (`n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`) for each test case.

To fix this, you need to modify the `func_1` function to accept parameters and use them accordingly. Here is the corrected version:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1(n, m, a, b):
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
    return
```

With this modification, the function `func_1` will correctly process each test case by receiving the required parameters.
