### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the provided problem description and function summary.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This is crucial because we want to maximize the sum of the array after Alice and Bob make their moves.

3. **Calculating Initial Sum (`ans1`):**
   - The initial sum of the array (`ans1`) is calculated using the sorted array.
   - This step is correct because it sets up the initial state before any removals or negations.

4. **Negating Elements by Bob:**
   - The program iterates through the top `x` elements of the sorted array and subtracts twice their value from `ans1`. This simulates Bob negating these elements.
   - This step is correct because it accounts for Bob's optimal strategy to minimize the sum.

5. **Removing Elements by Alice:**
   - The program iterates through the top `k` elements of the sorted array and adds them to `ans1`.
   - If `i + x < n`, it also subtracts twice the value of the corresponding element from the end of the array. This accounts for the interaction between Alice's removals and Bob's negations.
   - This step is correct because it simulates Alice's optimal strategy to maximize the sum.

6. **Finding the Maximum Sum:**
   - The program keeps track of the maximum sum (`ans2`) after considering the effects of both Alice and Bob's moves.
   - This step is correct because it ensures that the final result is the best possible sum under the given constraints.

Upon closer inspection, the program logic aligns with the optimal strategies for both players. Here is a detailed breakdown of why the program works:

- **Initial Sum Calculation (`ans1`):**
  - By sorting the array in descending order, the program ensures that the largest elements are considered first.
  - Subtracting twice the top `x` elements accounts for Bob's optimal strategy to minimize the sum by negating the largest elements.

- **Alice's Removals:**
  - Adding the top `k` elements accounts for Alice's optimal strategy to maximize the sum by removing the smallest elements.
  - The adjustment `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` when `i + x < n` ensures that the effect of Bob's negations is considered in the context of Alice's removals.

- **Maximizing the Sum:**
  - The variable `ans2` keeps track of the maximum sum after considering all possible moves by both players.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob.
