Output State: **`k` must be less than or equal to 0; `i` is either 0 or 1; `ans1` is increased by `a[i]` and decreased by `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`. If `i + x` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans1` is still increased by `a[i]`; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**.

This means that `ans2` now holds the maximum value between its original value and the current value of `ans1`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged from the initial state.
