Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `ans1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged, and `a` remains a list of integers sorted in descending order.
