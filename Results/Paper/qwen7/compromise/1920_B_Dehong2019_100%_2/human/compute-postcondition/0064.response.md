Output State: **`ans1` is the maximum of `ans1 - 2 * a[i + x] + a[i]` and `ans2`, `i` is `x + 2`, `k` must be greater than `x + 1`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` updates `ans1` by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is `x + 2`, so `a[i]` refers to `a[x + 2]`. However, since no specific values are given for `ans1`, `ans2`, or `a[i + x]`, we express the updated `ans1` as the maximum of `ans1 - 2 * a[i + x] + a[i]` and `ans2`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
