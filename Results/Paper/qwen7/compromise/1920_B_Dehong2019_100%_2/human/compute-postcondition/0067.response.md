Postcondition: `ans1` is the maximum of `ans2` and `ans1 - 2 * a[i + x] + a[i]`, `i` is `x + 2`, `k` must be greater than `x + 1`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is updated to be the maximum of `ans2` and `ans1 - 2 * a[i + x] - 2 * a[i]`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as above.
