Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans1` is `a[0] - 2 * a[x] - 4 * a[i + x] + a[i]` if `i + x < n`, or `a[0] - 2 * a[x] + 2 * a[i]` if `i + x >= n`, and `ans2` is equal to `max(ans1, ans2)`**.

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` subtracts `2 * a[i + x]` from `ans1`. Since `ans1` was originally defined as `a[0] - 2 * a[x] - 2 * a[i + x] + a[i]` if `i + x < n`, or `a[0] - 2 * a[x] + a[i] + a[i]` if `i + x >= n`, after the subtraction, it becomes `a[0] - 2 * a[x] - 4 * a[i + x] + a[i]` if `i + x < n`, or `a[0] - 2 * a[x] + 2 * a[i]` if `i + x >= n`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
