Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, `i` is `x + 1`, `k` must be greater than `x + 1`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**.

This means that `ans1` has been decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, while the other variables (`i`, `k`, and `ans2`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The condition that `k` must be greater than `x + 1` is still valid.
