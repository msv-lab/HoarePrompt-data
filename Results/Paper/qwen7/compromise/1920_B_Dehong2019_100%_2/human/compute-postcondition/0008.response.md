Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `x`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `ans1` is decreased by twice the value of `a[0]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increases by 1 with each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `x` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `x` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.
   - `i` changes to 1.
   - `ans1` is not directly affected by the loop head but might be updated inside the loop body, so we do not change its value here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
