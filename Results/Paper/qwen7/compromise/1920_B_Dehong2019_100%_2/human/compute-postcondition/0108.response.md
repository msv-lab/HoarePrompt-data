Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans1` will be the result of applying the loop's operations up to `k` times starting from the initial value of `ans1` minus the sum of `2 * a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `x`, and `ans2` will hold the highest value that `ans1` has taken during any iteration of the loop.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans1` will be updated based on the operations performed within the loop, and `ans2` will store the maximum value of `ans1` achieved during these iterations.
