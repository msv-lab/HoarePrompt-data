Output State: **`ans1` is the maximum of `ans2` and `ans1 - 2 * a[i + x] + a[i]`, `i` is `x + 2`, `k` must be greater than `x + 1`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `ans2` is updated to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans2` to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`. This means that `ans2` now holds the larger value between its current value and `ans1`. The other variables (`ans1`, `i`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
