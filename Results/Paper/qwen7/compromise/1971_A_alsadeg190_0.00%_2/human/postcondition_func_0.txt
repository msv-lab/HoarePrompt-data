The function processes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9). Based on the comparison between `x` and `y`, it prints either `x, y` or `y, x`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs pairs of integers as specified.
