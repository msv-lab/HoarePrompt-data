Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. It reads a single integer `x` at the beginning and then processes each test case within the loop, but it does not reset or properly handle the next test case after processing the first one. This leads to incorrect behavior for multiple test cases. For example, if the input is:

```
3
1 9
8 4
1 4
```

The program will only process the first pair `(1, 9)` and ignore the subsequent pairs, leading to incorrect output.
