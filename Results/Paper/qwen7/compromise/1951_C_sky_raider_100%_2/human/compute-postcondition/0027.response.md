Output State: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer minus `n * s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` is `n * s`, `i` is `n + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `l`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
