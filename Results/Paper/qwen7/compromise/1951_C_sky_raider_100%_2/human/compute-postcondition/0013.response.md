Output State: **`c` is `s * (l[i] + t)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` is `s`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `s = min(m, k)` updates the value of `s` to be the minimum of `m` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the value of `c` remains as `s * (l[i] + t)`, `l` remains a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` remains greater than 0, `m` remains an input integer, `k` remains an input integer, `t` remains `s`, and `i` is updated to `i + 1`.
