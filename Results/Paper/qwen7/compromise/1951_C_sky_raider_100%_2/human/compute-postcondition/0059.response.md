Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` is `s + s`, `k` is decreased by `n * s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from user input, `c` is `c + s * (l[i] + t)**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `t` is 0.
- After executing `t += s`, `t` is updated to `s + s`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
