Output State: **`c` is `c + s * (l[i] + t) + s * (l[i] + t)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer minus `s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` is `s + s`, `i` is `i + 1 + 1`**

Explanation: The code `c += s * (l[i] + t)` updates the value of `c` by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its current value. Since `i` was already incremented by 1 in the initial state, it is incremented by 1 again. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
