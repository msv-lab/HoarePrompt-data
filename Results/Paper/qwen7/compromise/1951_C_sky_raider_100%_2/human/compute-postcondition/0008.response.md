Output State: **`c` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` is 0.**

The code assigns the value of the minimum between `m` and `k` to `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
