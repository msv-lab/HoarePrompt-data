Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `min(m, k)`, `t` is 0, `k` is decreased by `n * s`, `i` is `n + 1`, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from user input, and `c` is the sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration.**

Explanation: The line `t = 0` sets the variable `t` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
