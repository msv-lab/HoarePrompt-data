Output State: **`total` is 0, `s` is equal to `min(m, k)`, `t` is 0, `c` is increased by `s * (l[i] + t)`**

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by the value of `s * (l[i] + t)`. Given that `t` is 0, the expression simplifies to `c += s * l[i]`. Since `s` is equal to `min(m, k)`, the final state of `c` is the original value of `c` plus `min(m, k) * l[i]`. The values of `total`, `s`, and `t` remain unchanged.
