Output State: **`s` is now the minimum of `m` and `k`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t + s`, `k` is decreased by `s`, `c` is `c + s * (l[i] + t)**.

Explanation: The variable `s` remains the minimum of `m` and `k`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The variable `n` remains an input integer. The variable `t` is updated to `t + s`. The variable `k` is decreased by `s`. Additionally, the variable `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[i] + t)`, where `l[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `l`.
