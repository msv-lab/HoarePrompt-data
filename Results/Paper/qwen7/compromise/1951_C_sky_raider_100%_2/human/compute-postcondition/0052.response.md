Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `min(m, k)`, `t` is `n * s`, `k` is decreased by `n * s`, `i` is `n + 1`, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from user input, and `c` is the sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration.**

Explanation: The code `l.sort()` sorts the list `l` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `t`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged. The list `l` is now sorted, and the variable `c` remains as the sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration, where `i` is `n + 1`.
