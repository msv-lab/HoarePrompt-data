Output State: **`c` is increased by `s * (l[i] + t)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` is `t + s`, `k` is decreased by `s`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= s` decreases the value of `k` by `s`. The other variables (`c`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
