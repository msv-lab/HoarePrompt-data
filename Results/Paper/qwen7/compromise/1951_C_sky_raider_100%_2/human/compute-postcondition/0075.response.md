Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer t, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers n, m, and k, and a list a of n integers. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the given inputs.**

This means the function `func` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes three more integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` is between 1 and \(3 \times 10^5\), `m` is between 1 and \(10^9\), and `k` is between 1 and the minimum of \(nm\) and \(10^9\). Additionally, it receives a list `a` containing `n` integers, each between 1 and \(10^9\). The function then processes these inputs and returns a result specific to each test case.
