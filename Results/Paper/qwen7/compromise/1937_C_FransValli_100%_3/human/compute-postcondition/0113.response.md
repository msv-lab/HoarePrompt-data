Output State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is 2, `maxi` is 0, `res` is a string that is not equal to '<', and the current value of `res` is '='**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is initially 1) to the list `arr`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The other variables (`mini`, `maxi`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
