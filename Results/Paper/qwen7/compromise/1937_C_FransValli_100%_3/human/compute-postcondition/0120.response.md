Output State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is 3, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the input from the user, `arr` is now `[3]`**.

Explanation: The code `arr = [i]` initializes the list `arr` with the value of `i`, which is 3. All other variables (`mini`, `maxi`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
