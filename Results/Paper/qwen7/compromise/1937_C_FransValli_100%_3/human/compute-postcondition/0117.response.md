Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `2`.

3. **Update the value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by `1` each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `3`.

4. **Check the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which will be `3` at the start of the next iteration) must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the other variables**:
   - `mini` is equal to the last element in `arr` and does not change within the loop head.
   - `maxi` is `0` and does not change within the loop head.
   - `res` is either the input string from the user which is '<' or a string that is not equal to '<', and it does not change within the loop head.

Given these points, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i` to `3`, and the condition for `n` must still hold true (i.e., `i < n`).

**Final State**:
State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is 3, `maxi` is 0, and `res` is either the input string from the user which is '<' or a string that is not equal to '<'.**
