Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mini` is equal to `arr[0]`, `i` will be less than `n`, `arr` will be a list containing either `[i]` or `[i + 1, i]` depending on the user inputs, `maxi` will still be 3, and `res` will be an input string from the user.
Code of the loop:
for item in arr[1:]:
    print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '>':
        mini = item


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `mini` is equal to `item`, `i` will be less than `n`, `arr` must have at least two elements, `maxi` is still 3, and `res` is set to '>' if the condition `res == '>'` is true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mini` is equal to the next `item` in `arr`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr` must have at least two elements, `maxi` is still 3, and `res` is an input string. This is true regardless of whether `res` equals '>' or not, as there is no else part to change these conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `mini` is equal to the second item in `arr`, `i` is incremented by 1, `maxi` is still 3, and `res` is the input string from the user. If `res` equals '>', then `mini` is updated to the input `item`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
