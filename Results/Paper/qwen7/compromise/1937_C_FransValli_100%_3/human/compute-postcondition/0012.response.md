Output State: **`maxi` is 1, `i` is 2, `res` is an input string**

The code `res = input()` assigns the value entered by the user to the variable `res`. Since the initial value of `res` was specified as an input string where the current value is '<', the new value of `res` will be the string entered by the user. The values of `maxi` and `i` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
