Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`.
   - `i` is either 4 or 5 depending on the value of `res`.
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `res` is the input from the user.
   - `arr` now contains the elements `[last element of arr, 3, 4]` if `res` equals `'='`, or `[3]` if `res` equals `'<'`.
   - `n` must be greater than 5 or 6 respectively.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `maxi` is explicitly stated to be 0.
   - `arr[0]` will depend on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is `'='`, then `arr` is `[last element of arr, 3, 4]`, so `arr[0]` is the last element of `arr`.
     - If `res` is `'<'`, then `arr` is `[3]`, so `arr[0]` is 3.
   - `i` is either 4 or 5 depending on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is `'='`, then `i` is 5.
     - If `res` is `'<'`, then `i` is 4.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `res` is `'='`:
     - `maxi` is 0.
     - `arr[0]` is the last element of `arr`.
     - `i` is 5.
     - The print statement will output: `'? 0 [last element of arr] 0 5'`.
   - If `res` is `'<'`:
     - `maxi` is 0.
     - `arr[0]` is 3.
     - `i` is 4.
     - The print statement will output: `'? 0 3 0 4'`.

Given the format requirement, we need to provide the most precise description possible based on the precondition. Since the exact value of the last element of `arr` is not specified, we will consider both scenarios.

Output: **'? 0 [last element of arr] 0 5' or '? 0 3 0 4'**
