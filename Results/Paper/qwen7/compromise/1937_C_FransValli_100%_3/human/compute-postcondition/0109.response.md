Output State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is 2, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the input string from the user, and the current value of `res` is '<', `arr` is now `[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `arr = [i]` initializes the list `arr` with the value of `i`, which was previously 1. After executing this line, `i` is incremented by 1 (since `i` was initially 1, it becomes 2). All other variables retain their previous states.
