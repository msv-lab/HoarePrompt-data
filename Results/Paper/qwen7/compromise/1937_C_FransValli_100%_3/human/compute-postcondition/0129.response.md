Output State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is either 4 or 5 depending on the value of `res`, `maxi` is 0, `res` is an input from the user, and `arr` is [i]**.

Explanation: The code `arr = [i]` replaces the current list `arr` with a new list containing only the element `i`. Since `i` is either 4 or 5 depending on the value of `res`, the updated list `arr` will contain either `[4]` or `[5]`. The other variables (`mini`, `maxi`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
