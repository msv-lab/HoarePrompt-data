Output State: **`mini` is `arr[0]`, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, `res` is an input string which is either '<' or '=', `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code sets `mini` to the first element of the array `arr`, which is `arr[0]`. The other variables (`i`, `maxi`, `n`, `res`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
