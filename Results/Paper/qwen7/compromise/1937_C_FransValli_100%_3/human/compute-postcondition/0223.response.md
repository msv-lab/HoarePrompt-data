Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for item in arr[1:]`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `item`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `mini` is `item`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `maxi` is `n-1`.
   - `res` is an input string which is either '<' or '='.
   - `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `item` is `arr[1]`.
   - If `res` is '>', the function does not change the values of `mini`, `i`, `maxi`, `res`, `arr`, and `item`.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `arr[1:]`, which means it starts from `arr[1]` (the second element) and goes up to `arr[n-1]`.
   - In each iteration, `item` takes the value of the current element in the loop.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `item`:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `arr[1:]`, the next value of `item` will be the next element in `arr` after the current `item`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `item`, so we need to adjust its value.
   - If the current `item` is `arr[1]`, the next `item` will be `arr[2]`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `mini` remains unchanged because the condition `res == '>'` prevents changes.
   - `i` remains unchanged because the condition `res == '>'` prevents changes.
   - `maxi` remains unchanged because the condition `res == '>'` prevents changes.
   - `res` remains unchanged because the condition `res == '>'` prevents changes.
   - `arr` remains unchanged because the condition `res == '>'` prevents changes.
   - `item` changes to the next element in `arr`, which is `arr[2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`mini` is `item`, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string which is either '<' or '=', `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`, `item` is `arr[2]`**.
