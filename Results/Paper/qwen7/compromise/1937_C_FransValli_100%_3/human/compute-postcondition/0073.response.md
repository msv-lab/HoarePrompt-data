Output State: **`mini` is equal to the second item in `arr`, `i` is incremented by 1, `maxi` is still 3, and `res` is the input string from the user.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user using `input()`. The other variables (`mini`, `i`, and `maxi`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
