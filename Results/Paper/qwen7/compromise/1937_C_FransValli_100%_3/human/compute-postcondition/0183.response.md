Output State: **`i` is `n`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, `res` is an input string which is not '<', `arr` is `[0]`**.

The code initializes a list `arr` with a single element `0`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `maxi`, `n`, or `res`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
