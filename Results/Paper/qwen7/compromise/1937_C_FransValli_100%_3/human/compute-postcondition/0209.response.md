Output State: **`i` is 3; `maxi` is `n-1`; `n` is greater than `n-1`; `res` is an input string; `arr` is a list containing the element 3.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `arr` with the value of `i`, which is 3. The other variables (`maxi`, `n`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
