Output State: **`arr` must have at least `len(arr) + 1` elements, `mini` will hold the minimum value found in the array after comparing each element with the current `mini`, `maxi` remains 0, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `n`. The other variables (`arr`, `mini`, `maxi`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
