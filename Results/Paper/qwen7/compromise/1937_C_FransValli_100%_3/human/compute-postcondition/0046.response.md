Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 10
   - `i` is less than `n`
   - `arr` is a list containing either `[i]` or `[i, i + 1]`
   - `maxi` is 3
   - `res` is an input string which is either equal to '<' or '=' and is an input from the user

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs as long as `i < n`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (assuming it was less than `n`).
   - Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

Given this information, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `total` remains unchanged at 10.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was previously less than `n`, it will now be `i + 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `arr` is a list containing either `[i]` or `[i, i + 1]`, but since `i` changes, `arr` will now contain either `[i + 1]` or `[i + 1, i + 2]`.
- `maxi` remains unchanged at 3.
- `res` remains unchanged as it is an input from the user and does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`total` is 10, `i` is less than `n`, `arr` is a list containing either `[i + 1]` or `[i + 1, i + 2]`, `maxi` is 3, `res` is an input string which is either equal to '<' or '=' and is an input from the user.**
