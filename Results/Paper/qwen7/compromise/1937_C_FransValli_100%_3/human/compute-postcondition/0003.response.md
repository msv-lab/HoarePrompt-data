State: **`maxi` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. The loop condition `1 <= i < n` must be satisfied for the loop to execute.
3. Initially, `maxi` is 0, but this variable is not directly involved in the loop condition.
4. For the loop to start, `i` must be initialized to 1 (the starting point of the range).
5. `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure that there is at least one iteration where `1 <= i < n` holds true.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being 1 and `n` being greater than 1.
