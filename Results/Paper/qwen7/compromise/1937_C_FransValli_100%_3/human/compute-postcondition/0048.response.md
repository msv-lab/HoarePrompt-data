Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is less than `n`, `arr` is a list containing either `[i + 1]` or `[i + 1, i + 2]`, `maxi` is 3, `res` is an input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the value entered by the user as a string to the variable `res`. The other variables (`total`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, and `maxi`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `res` is now dependent on the user's input, hence it is described as "an input string from the user."
