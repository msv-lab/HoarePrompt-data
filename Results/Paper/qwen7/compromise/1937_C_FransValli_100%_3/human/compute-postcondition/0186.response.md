Output State: **`i` is 1, `maxi` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, `res` is an input string which is not `<`, `arr` is `[0]`, `res` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the value entered by the user (as a string) to the variable `res`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
