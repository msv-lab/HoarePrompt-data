Based on the initial state provided:

- `mini` is equal to `arr[0]`. This means `mini` is the first element of the list `arr`.
- `i` will be less than `n`. Since `n` is not explicitly defined, we don't know the exact value of `i`, but it's clear that `i` is less than `n`.
- `arr` must have at least two elements. Therefore, `arr` has at least two items.
- `maxi` will still be 3. This means `maxi` is explicitly set to 3.
- `res` will be an input string from the user. However, since `res` is not used in the print statement, it does not affect the output.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

Here, `mini` is printed twice, and `item` is printed twice. Since `item` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. 

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]**
