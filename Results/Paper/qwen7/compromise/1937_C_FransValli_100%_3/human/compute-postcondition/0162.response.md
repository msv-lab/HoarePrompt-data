Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**: 
   - `i` is initialized to 1 (since the loop starts from `range(1, n)`).
   - `n` is an input integer, but its specific value is not given. We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `n` must be at least 2 (since `range(1, n)` requires `n > 1`).

3. **Consider the State of Other Variables**:
   - `maxi` is currently 0 and remains unchanged.
   - `mini` will hold the minimum value found in the array after comparing each element with the current `mini`, but its initial state is not relevant for determining if the loop can execute.
   - `i` remains unchanged, so it is already set to 1.

Given these points, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

- `i` should be set to 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
