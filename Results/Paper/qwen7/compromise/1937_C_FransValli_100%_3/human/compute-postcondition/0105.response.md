Based on the initial state provided:

- `mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`.
- `i` is 1.
- `maxi` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `res` is the final input string from the user, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down the values that will be printed:

- `'?'`: This is a literal string that will be printed.
- `maxi`: The value of `maxi` is 0.
- `arr[0]`: Since `mini` is the last element in `arr`, and there is no specific value given for `arr`, we cannot determine `arr[0]` directly. However, the problem does not require us to know the entire list `arr`, only that `arr[0]` is one of its elements.
- `maxi`: Again, the value of `maxi` is 0.
- `i`: The value of `i` is 1.
- `flush=True`: This parameter ensures that the output is flushed immediately, but it does not affect what is printed.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output the following:
Output: **'? 0 [arr[0]] 0 1'** (where `[arr[0]]` represents the first element of the list `arr`).
