Output State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is 4, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the input from the user, and `arr` now contains the elements [last element of `arr`, 3, 4]**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `arr`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1, making its new value 4. The value of `mini` remains unchanged as it is equal to the last element in `arr` before the append operation. The values of `maxi` and `res` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
