Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is 2.
2. The initial state also tells us that `n` is greater than 2, but it does not give an explicit value for `n`. Since `maxi` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value directly from the given information.
3. The print statement includes `maxi`, but since `maxi` is not defined, we cannot know its value. We can only describe it as `maxi` without a specific value.
4. The print statement also includes `i`, which we know is 2.

Given this information, the print statement will output a string with placeholders for `maxi` and `i`.

Output: **'? maxi maxi 2 2'**
