Based on the initial state provided:

- `mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`. This means `mini` is the last element of the list `arr`.
- `i` is 3.
- `maxi` is 0.
- `res` is either the input string from the user which is '<' or a string that is not equal to '<'. However, this variable is not used in the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down what will be printed:

- `'?'`: This is a literal string.
- `maxi`: The value of `maxi` is 0.
- `arr[0]`: Since `arr` is not explicitly defined with its contents, we cannot determine the exact value of `arr[0]`. However, it is a part of the list `arr`.
- `maxi`: Again, the value of `maxi` is 0.
- `i`: The value of `i` is 3.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? 0 [arr[0]] 0 3'** (where `[arr[0]]` represents the first element of the list `arr`).
