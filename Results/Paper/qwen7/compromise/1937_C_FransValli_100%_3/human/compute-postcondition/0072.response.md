Based on the initial state provided:

- `mini` is equal to the second item in `arr`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `arr` must have at least two elements.
- `maxi` is still 3.
- `res` is an input string.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `'?'` is a literal string that will be printed as is.
- `mini` is the second element of `arr`.
- `item` is not defined in the initial state, so it will remain as `item` in the output.

Since `mini` is the second element of `arr` and `arr` must have at least two elements, `mini` is a valid value from `arr`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? [mini] [mini] item item' (where [mini] is the second element of `arr`)**
