Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(1, n)` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `maxi` is 2
   - `i` is 2
   - `res` is an input string (though its value is not relevant for adjusting the loop state)

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - The variable `n` must remain unchanged or be set such that `i < n` still holds true.

Given that `i` is 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be 3. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3 to ensure the loop continues.

So, the updated state for the next iteration is:
State: **`maxi` is 2, `i` is 3, `res` is an input string, `n` must be greater than 3**
