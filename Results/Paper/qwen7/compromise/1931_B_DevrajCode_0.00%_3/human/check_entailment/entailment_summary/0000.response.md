Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers.
2. The solution correctly calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is the total amount of water divided by the number of containers (`total_water // n`).
3. The solution uses a cumulative difference (`container`) to track how much water needs to be moved between containers to reach the target. If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means there isn't enough water in the earlier containers to meet the target, hence returning 'No'.
4. If the cumulative difference never goes negative, it means the operations can balance the water across all containers, returning 'Yes'.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the provided code accurately implements the solution described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
