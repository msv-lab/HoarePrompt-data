### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if we can make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container's index is always less than the destination container's index.

2. **Key Insight**: Given that the sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers (`n`), it is theoretically possible to distribute the water evenly among the containers. This means each container should end up with `total_water / n` units of water.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`.
   - If the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, it returns 'No'.
   - If it is divisible, it calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It then iterates through each container and checks if the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount accumulates to a negative value. If it does, it means it's impossible to balance the water, and it returns 'No'.
   - If no such accumulation occurs, it returns 'Yes'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where the total amount of water is not divisible by `n` correctly.
   - However, the code does not actually simulate the pouring process. Instead, it checks if the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the target amount can become negative. This is a theoretical check and does not guarantee that the actual pouring process can achieve the desired result.

5. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The code reads input from standard input, which is fine for the given problem constraints.
   - The output format matches the required format.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the states and the logic flow.
   - The state transitions and the logic are consistent with the problem description.
   - However, the logic to check if the water can be balanced does not simulate the actual pouring process but rather checks if the cumulative difference can become negative, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition.

### Conclusion:

While the code correctly identifies when the total water is not divisible by `n`, and it correctly checks if the cumulative difference can become negative, it does not actually simulate the pouring process. The logic to check if the water can be balanced is a necessary condition but not a sufficient one. The program assumes that if the cumulative difference does not become negative, the water can be balanced, which is not always true.

### Correctness:

**False**
