Output State: `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that the sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`, `target` is `total_water // n`, and `container` is 0 if the loop does not return 'No' during its execution. If the loop returns 'No', `container` is undefined because the function would exit before setting the value.
