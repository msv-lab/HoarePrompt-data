Output State: **`total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that the sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`, `target` is `total_water // n`, and `container` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `container` to 0. This does not affect the values of `total_water`, `n`, `a`, or `target`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `container` is updated to 0.
