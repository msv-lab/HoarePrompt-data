Output State: **t is the number of test cases, and for each test case, the output is either -1 or the minimum value between half of the sum of a, b, and c (rounded down) and the sum of a and b, provided that the sum of a, b, and c is even. If the sum is odd, the output is -1.**

This description captures the essence of the loop's behavior without relying on the specific initial state values, ensuring it remains general and understandable.
