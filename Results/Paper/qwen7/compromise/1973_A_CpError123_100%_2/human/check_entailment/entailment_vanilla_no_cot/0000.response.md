Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Score Calculation**: The total score \( S \) from all games can be expressed as \( S = 2w + d \), where \( w \) is the number of wins and \( d \) is the number of draws. Since each win contributes 2 points and each draw contributes 1 point to the total score, the total score must be even. This part of the check is correct.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The formula used in the code to find the maximum number of draws, `min(x, y)`, is incorrect. The correct approach involves considering the distribution of wins and draws among the three players. Specifically, the number of draws should be maximized while ensuring the scores are consistent.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Check if total score is even
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Total points from games
        total_points = (a + b + c) // 2
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of wins needed
        min_wins = a + b - total_points
        
        # Maximum number of draws
        max_draws = total_points - min_wins
        
        # Ensure the calculated draws do not exceed the possible draws
        if max_draws > b + c - a - b:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_draws)

func()
```

This corrected function properly checks the consistency of the scores and calculates the maximum number of draws accurately.
