Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each case individually.
2. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores (`a + b + c`) is even. This is a necessary condition but not sufficient. The sum being odd directly implies that the scores cannot be achieved, hence printing `-1` is correct in such cases.
3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**: The program calculates `x = (a + b + c) // 2` and `y = a + b`. It then prints `min(x, y)`. This part of the logic is flawed because:
   - `x` represents the total number of games played (since each game contributes 2 points to the total score).
   - `y = a + b` represents the total points scored by the first two players combined.
   - The maximum number of draws is not simply `min(x, y)`.

### Correct Approach

To find the maximum number of draws, we need to consider the following:
- Each game can either end in a win/loss (2 points for one player) or a draw (1 point for each player).
- The total points scored by all players must be even.
- We need to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the scores are achievable.

### Correct Logic

1. **Check Sum Parity**: Ensure the sum of scores is even.
2. **Calculate Total Points**: Calculate the total points scored by all players.
3. **Determine Maximum Draws**: 
   - Let \(d\) be the number of draws.
   - Let \(w\) be the number of wins (where one player wins and the other loses).
   - The equation for total points is \(2w + d = \text{total points}\).
   - The equation for the number of games is \(w + d = \text{total games}\).
   - We need to maximize \(d\) while ensuring \(2w + d = \text{total points}\) and \(w + d \leq \text{total games}\).

### Revised Program

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = a + b + c
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the total number of games
        total_games = (total_points - (a + b)) // 2
        if total_games < 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        max_draws = min(total_games, a + b - total_games)
        print(max_draws)
```

### Evaluation

- The revised program correctly handles the sum parity check.
- It calculates the total number of games and ensures it is non-negative.
- It calculates the maximum number of draws using the correct logic.

Given the revised logic, the original assessment was inaccurate because the program did not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws but did handle the sum parity check appropriately.

Final: **False**
