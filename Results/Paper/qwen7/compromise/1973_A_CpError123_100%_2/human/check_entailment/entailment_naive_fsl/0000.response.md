Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the scores are inconsistent with the rules of the game. Specifically, the program checks if `(a + b + c) % 2 != 0` and prints `-1` if true. However, this check alone is insufficient. The program should also ensure that the scores can be achieved through a combination of wins and draws. For instance, in the case `1 1 2`, the program incorrectly prints `-1` because it only checks the parity of the sum of scores without considering the possible distribution of wins and draws.

A correct approach would involve checking if the scores can be achieved through a valid combination of wins and draws, ensuring that the constraints of the game are met.
