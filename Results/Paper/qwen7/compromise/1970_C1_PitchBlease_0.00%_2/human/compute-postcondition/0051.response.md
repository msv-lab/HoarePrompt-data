Output State: **`tree[current]` must contain at least one element; `neighbor` is not in `visited`; `visited` now includes the `neighbor`.**

Explanation: The code adds the `neighbor` to the `visited` set. This means that the `neighbor` is now marked as visited. All other conditions and relationships remain unchanged.
