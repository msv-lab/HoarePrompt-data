Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple (`start`, 0), `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, and `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree.**

The code initializes a queue with a single tuple `(start, 0)`. This means the starting node (`start`) is enqueued along with a distance of `0` from the start node. The values of `start`, `target`, and the structure of the tree remain unchanged.
