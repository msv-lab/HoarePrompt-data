Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `queue` now contains all the elements it previously had except for the first tuple (which has been dequeued). If `current` is equal to `target`, the function returns the distance `dist` which was the second element of the tuple that was dequeued from the queue. Otherwise, the function returns None.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `tree[current]` must contain at least one element; if `neighbor` is not in `visited`, then `visited` now includes the `neighbor` and `queue` now contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `tree[current]` must contain at least one element, and if `neighbor` is not in `visited`, then `visited` now contains `neighbor`, and `queue` contains a tuple of `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. If `neighbor` is already in `visited`, no changes are made to `visited` or `queue`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `tree[current]` must contain at least one element, `neighbor` is the first element of `tree[current]`, and either `neighbor` is added to `visited` and `queue` now contains a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` is not in `visited`, or nothing changes if `neighbor` is already in `visited`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
