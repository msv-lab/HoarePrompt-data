Output State: **The program returns 0**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that a tuple from the queue was dequeued, and the integer from that tuple (now stored in `current`) is equal to the `target`. The distance (`dist`) traveled to reach the `target` is 0 because no steps were taken after dequeuing the tuple since the `current` node is already the `target`. Therefore, the program returns 0.
