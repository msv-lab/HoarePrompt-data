Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple (neighbor, dist + 1), `current` is the integer from the tuple that was dequeued (originally the `start`), `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `current`, and `neighbor`, and `current` has at least one unvisited neighbor.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. Here, `neighbor` is a neighbor of the current node, and `dist + 1` represents the distance to this neighbor, which is the distance to the current node plus one. The other variables remain unchanged.
