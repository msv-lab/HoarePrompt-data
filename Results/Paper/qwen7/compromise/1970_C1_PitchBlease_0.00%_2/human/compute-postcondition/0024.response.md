Output State: The queue is a deque containing tuples of the form (neighbor, dist + 1) for each unvisited neighbor of the current node, `current` is the last unvisited neighbor of the previous current node that was dequeued, `dist` is the distance from the start node to the current node, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, including the start node and all its unvisited neighbors, and the current node is not equal to the target node.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the queue will contain tuples for all unvisited neighbors of the current node, `current` will be the last node that was dequeued and processed, `dist` will represent the shortest path distance from the start node to the current node, `visited` will include all nodes that have been explored during the traversal, and the current node will still not be the target node.
