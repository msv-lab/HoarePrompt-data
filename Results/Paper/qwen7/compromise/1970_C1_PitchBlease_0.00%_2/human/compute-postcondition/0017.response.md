Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple (neighbor, dist + 1), `current` is a neighbor of the original current node that is unvisited, `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `current`, `neighbor`, and `neighbor` is added to `visited`.**

Explanation: The line `visited.add(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` to the `visited` set. The other variables remain unchanged.
