Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `queue` is a deque containing the tuple that was second in the original queue, `current` is the integer from the tuple that was dequeued (originally the `start`), `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the elements `start` and the `current` node. The `current` node is not equal to the `target`.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `queue` is a deque containing the tuple (neighbor, dist + 1), `current` is the integer from the tuple that was dequeued (originally the `start`), `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `current`, and `neighbor`, and `current` has at least one unvisited neighbor.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `queue` is a deque containing the tuple (`neighbor`, `dist + 1`), `current` is a neighbor of the original current node that is unvisited, `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `current`, and `neighbor`, and `neighbor` is added to `visited`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `queue` is a deque containing the tuple (`neighbor`, `dist + 1`), `current` is the next unvisited neighbor of the original current node, `dist` is 1, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `current`, and `neighbor`, and `neighbor` is added to `visited`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
