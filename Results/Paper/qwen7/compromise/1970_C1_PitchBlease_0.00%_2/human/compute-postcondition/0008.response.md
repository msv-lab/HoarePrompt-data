Postcondition: `queue` is a deque containing the tuple that was second in the original queue, `current` is the integer from the tuple that was dequeued (originally the `start`), `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the elements `start` and the `current` node. The `current` node is not equal to the `target`.
