Postcondition: **The `queue` is a deque without the first element (which was dequeued), `current` is the neighbor that was dequeued from the `queue`, `dist` is the distance from the `start` node to the `current` node. If `current` is the `target` node, the function returns `dist`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.**
