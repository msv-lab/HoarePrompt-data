### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction**: The program correctly constructs the tree using an adjacency list representation. This is verified by the construction of the `tree` dictionary from the given edges.

2. **Leaf Identification**: The program correctly identifies the two leaves of the tree. Since the tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves, the logic to find these leaves is correct.

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: The BFS function is implemented correctly. It finds the shortest path from the starting node to the target leaf node and returns the distance. This is crucial for determining the winner based on the parity of the distances.

4. **Distance Calculation and Winner Determination**:
   - The program calculates the distances from the starting node to both leaves using BFS.
   - If either of these distances is even, Ron wins because he makes the first move and can always force the game into a state where the distance is even.
   - If both distances are odd, Hermione wins because she can always respond to Ron's moves and force the game into a state where the distance is even.

5. **Input Handling and Output**:
   - The program handles the input correctly, reading the number of nodes, edges, and starting nodes.
   - It calls the `func_1` function with the appropriate parameters and prints the result.

Given the above points, the program logic is sound and should produce the correct output for the given problem statement and constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
