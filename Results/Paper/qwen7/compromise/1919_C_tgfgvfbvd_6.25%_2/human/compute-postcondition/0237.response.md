Postcondition: `l[x]`, `a`, and `b` are integers. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and either `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]` is true, then `a` is equal to `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is equal to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`; otherwise, `l[x]` is set to `b`.
