Postcondition: `y` is `n - 1`, `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`, and `b` is assigned the first element of the list `l` if no element in the list from index 1 to `n-1` is greater than the first element, and the condition `(a >= l[x])` is true for at least one `x` in the range from `y + 1` to `n - 1`.
