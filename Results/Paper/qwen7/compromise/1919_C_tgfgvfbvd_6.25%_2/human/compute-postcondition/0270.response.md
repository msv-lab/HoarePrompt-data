Output State: **`x` is `x + 1`, `n` must be greater than `x + 1`, `b` is the value of `l[x]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `l[x]` to the variable `b`. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that `n` must be greater than `x + 1` is still valid.
