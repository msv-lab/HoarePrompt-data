Postcondition: `y` is `n`, `x` is `n + 2`, and `b` is the maximum value between `l[x]` and the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`. Specifically, if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `b` remains the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x]` is greater than `b - l[x]`.
