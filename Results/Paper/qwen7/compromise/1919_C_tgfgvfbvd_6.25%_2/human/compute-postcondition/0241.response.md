Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `x` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `x` from `y + 1` to `n - 1`.

3. **Determine the New State of `x`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was some value within the range `[y + 1, n - 1]`. For the next iteration, `x` needs to be incremented by 1.

4. **Check the Range**: After incrementing `x` by 1, it should still be within the range `[y + 1, n - 1]`. If `x` reaches `n - 1`, the loop will terminate.

5. **Adjust the State**: We need to update the state such that `x` is now one more than its previous value, while ensuring it remains within the valid range.

Given the conditions:
- `l[x]` is an integer.
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is an integer.

Since these values (`l[x]`, `a`, and `b`) are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `x`.

**New State**:
- `x` is now `x + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.

So, the new state is:

State: **`x` is `x + 1`, `n` must be greater than `x + 1`**
