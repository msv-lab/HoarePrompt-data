Postcondition: `x` is `x + 1`, `n` must be greater than `x + 1`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `a` is the new value at index `x` in list `l`. Otherwise, `b` is the new value at index `x` in list `l`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` becomes the new value at index `x` in list `l`. Otherwise, `b` becomes the new value at index `x` in list `l`.
