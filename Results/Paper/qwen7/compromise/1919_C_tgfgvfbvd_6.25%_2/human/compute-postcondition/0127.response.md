Output State: **`y` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, and `c` is increased by 1.**

The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `c`, we only know that it has been increased by 1. All other variables (`y`, `n`, and `l[x]`) remain in their respective states as described in the initial state.
