Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for y in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `y` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `y` is initialized to 1 (the starting point of the range).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `y` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `y` is set to 1 initially.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

5. **Consider other variables**: The other variables (`t`, `l`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `y`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution directly. They can remain as given in the initial state.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `y` being 1 and `n` being greater than 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`y` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
