Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in range(y + 1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x`, `y`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `y` is 3.
   - `n` is greater than 4.
   - `x` is `n`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `x` is within the range `(y + 1, n)`. This means `x` should be incremented from `y + 1` up to `n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is currently `n`, the next value of `x` would be `n + 1`.
   - The value of `y` remains unchanged.
   - The condition `n` being greater than 4 still holds.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `y` remains 3.
   - `n` remains greater than 4.
   - `x` becomes `n + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`y` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4, `x` is `n + 1`**.
