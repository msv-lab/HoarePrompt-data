Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to split the array into two subsequences such that the total penalty (number of indices where the current element is less than the next element) is minimized.
2. **Implementation Issues**:
   - The program attempts to identify the smallest and second smallest unique elements (`a` and `b`) in the array and count how many elements are either greater than both or closer to the smaller element than to the larger one. This approach is flawed because it does not ensure the optimal splitting of the array.
   - The logic for counting elements that are either greater than both `a` and `b` or closer to the smaller element is incorrect. It does not consider the correct way to split the array to minimize the penalty.
   - The program does not handle the splitting of the array into two subsequences in a way that minimizes the total penalty. Instead, it tries to find specific elements and count them, which does not align with the problem requirements.

Given the issues in the implementation, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
