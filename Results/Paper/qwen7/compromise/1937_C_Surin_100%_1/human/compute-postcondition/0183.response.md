Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `v2` is 1
   - If `r` is equal to '<', `v1` is 1. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `v2` and the condition involving `v1` and `r` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
   - `v2` remains 1.
   - The condition involving `v1` and `r` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `v2` is 1, and if `r` is equal to '<', `v1` is 1. If `r` is not '<', the postcondition remains unchanged.**
