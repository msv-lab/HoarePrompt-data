Output State: **`r` is an input string, `prev` is either `i` or `i+1`, `i` is `i+1`, `n` is greater than `i+1` if `prev` is `i+1`, `r2` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `r2 = input('')` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `r2`. The values of `r`, `prev`, and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition for `n` being greater than `i+1` if `prev` is `i+1` also remains valid.
