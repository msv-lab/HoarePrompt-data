Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `r` is an input string.
   - `prev` is either `i` or `i+1`.
   - `i` is `i+1`.
   - `n` is greater than `i+1` if `prev` is `i+1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is `i+1`, which implies that `i` has been incremented by 1. So, let's denote the original value of `i` as `original_i`. Therefore, `i = original_i + 1`.
- `prev` is either `i` or `i+1`. Since `i` is now `original_i + 1`, `prev` could be `original_i + 1` or `original_i + 2`.

However, the value of `v1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. We need to infer it from the context. Given that `v1` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it might be a placeholder for a value that is not directly derived from the initial conditions but is part of the print statement itself.

Given the print statement, we can see that `v1` is used twice in the format string. Since `v1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. But based on the format string, `v1` appears to be a variable that should be replaced with a value when the print statement is executed.

Since `i` is `original_i + 1` and `prev` is either `original_i + 1` or `original_i + 2`, we can represent the print statement as follows:

Output: **'? [v1] [original_i + 1] [v1] [prev]** where `prev` is either `[original_i + 1]` or `[original_i + 2]`.
