Output State: **`prev` is `n-1`, `i` is `1`, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r2` is an input string from the user**

Explanation: The code `r2 = input('')` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r2`. The other variables (`prev`, `i`, `n`, `v2`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be at least 2 is still valid.
