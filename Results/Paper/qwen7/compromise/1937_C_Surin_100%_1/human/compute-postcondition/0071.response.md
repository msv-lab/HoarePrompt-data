Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `prev` is `1`
   - `i` is `1`
   - `n` must be at least `2`
   - `v2` is `n-1`
   - `r` is the input string from the user
   - If `r` equals `>`, then `prev` remains `1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `1` and `n` must be at least `2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be `2`.
   - `n` must still be at least `2` for the loop to continue.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `prev` remains `1` (since the condition `if r == '>'` was not met or `r` was not provided).
   - `i` becomes `2`.
   - `n` must still be at least `2`.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `prev` is `1`
   - `i` is `2`
   - `n` must be at least `2`
   - `v2` is `n-1`, which is `1` (since `n` is at least `2`)
   - `r` is the input string from the user (no change)

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`prev` is `1`, `i` is `2`, `n` must be at least `2`, `v2` is `1`, `r` is the input string from the user**.
