Output State: **`i` is `n`, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the user inputs during the loop iterations.**

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` (since the loop runs from 1 to `n-1` and increments `i` each time). The variables `v2` and `v1` will both remain at their initial value of `n-1`, as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `prev` will retain its final value determined by the user's inputs during the loop iterations, which could be either `n-1` or `n-2`.
