Output State: **`prev` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is `n-1`, and `r` remains as the input string from the user.**

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `prev` will be `n-1`, and `i` will also be `n-1`. The variable `n` must be at least 2. The value of `v2` remains `n-1`. The variable `r` retains the last input string received from the user during any iteration where `r` was either '>' or '='. If `r` was neither '>' nor '=', it remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
