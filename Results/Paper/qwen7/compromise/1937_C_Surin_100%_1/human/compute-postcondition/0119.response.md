Output State: `prev` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `g` is `0`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (from `i=1` to `i=n-1`), the value of `i` will be `n`. However, the loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`, which means `i` will stop just before reaching `n`. Therefore, `i` will be `n-1` after the loop. Since `v2` and `v1` are both set to the current value of `i` inside the loop, they will also be `n-1` after all iterations. The other variables (`prev`, `n`, `g`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
