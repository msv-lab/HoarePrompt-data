Output State: **`prev` is `n-1`, `i` is `1`, `n` must be greater than `1`, `v2` is `1`, `v1` is `0`, `g` is `0`**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or change their values. It only flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which is an operation related to I/O handling rather than variable assignment or modification. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
