Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `v2` is 2, and the current value of `r` is either unchanged or equal to '<'**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending buffered data is written to the standard output. However, this operation does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `v2`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
