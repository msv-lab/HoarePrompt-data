Output State: **`i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables. It only flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which means it ensures that all pending output is written to the terminal or file. Since no variables are updated or affected by this operation, the values of `i`, `v2`, `v1`, and `prev` remain unchanged.
