Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides us with the following information:
   - `i` is set to 3.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `v1` is also `n-1`.
   - `prev` is either 0 or 1.
   - The system output buffer is flushed, meaning any previous output is cleared.

2. We need to determine the value of `n` to find the values of `v2` and `v1`. However, the value of `n` is not explicitly given. Since `v2` and `v1` are both described as `n-1`, we can assume they will take the same value if `n` is the same for both.

3. The print statement is:
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

4. Substituting the known values into the print statement:
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `v1` is again `n-1`.
   - `prev` is either 0 or 1.

5. Therefore, the print statement will output:
   ```plaintext
   '? [n-1] 3 [n-1] [0 or 1]'
   ```

6. Since `n` is not specified, we can only express `v1` as `n-1`.

Output: **'? [n-1] 3 [n-1] [0 or 1]'**
