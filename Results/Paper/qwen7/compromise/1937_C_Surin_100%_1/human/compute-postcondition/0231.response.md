Output State: **`i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is 2, `r2` is an input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 2) to the variable `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `prev` is updated to 2, while `i`, `v2`, `v1`, and `r2` retain their original values.
