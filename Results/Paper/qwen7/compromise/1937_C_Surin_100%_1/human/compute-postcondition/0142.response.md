Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `r` is an input string.
   - If `r` equals `'>'`, then `prev` is an input integer.
   - If `r` equals `'='`, then `r2` is the input string from the user.
   - If `r2` equals `'<'`, then `prev` is set to `i + 1`, and `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The code snippet is `print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')`.

From the initial state, we don't have explicit values for `v1`, `i`, and `prev`. We need to consider the possible scenarios based on the value of `r` and `r2`.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1:** `r = '>'`
  - In this case, `prev` is an input integer.
  - `v1`, `i`, and `prev` are not explicitly defined, so we cannot determine their exact values without additional information.
- **Scenario 2:** `r = '='`
  - In this case, `r2` is the input string from the user.
  - If `r2 = '<'`, then `prev` is set to `i + 1`, and `i` is `i + 1`.
  - Again, `v1` and `i` are not explicitly defined, so we cannot determine their exact values without additional information.

Given the lack of specific values for `v1`, `i`, and `prev`, we can only describe them in terms of their roles and potential values.

### Final Output:
Output: **'? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]**' (where `v1` is a placeholder for the value of `v1`, `i` is a placeholder for the value of `i`, and `prev` is a placeholder for the value of `prev`).

This output reflects the structure of the print statement with placeholders for the undefined variables.
