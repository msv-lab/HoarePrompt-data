Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `v1` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` is an input string from the user**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `v2` (which is 3) to `v1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` remains 3, `n` must still be greater than 2, `v1` is now 3 (same as `v2`), and `r` remains an input string from the user.
