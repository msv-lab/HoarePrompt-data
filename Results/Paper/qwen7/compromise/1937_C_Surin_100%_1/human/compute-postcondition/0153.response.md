Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `r` is an input string (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `prev` is either `i` or `i+1`.
   - `i` is either `i` or `i+1`.
   - `n` is greater than `i+1` if `prev` is `i+1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still satisfy the condition `n > i + 1` if `prev` was `i + 1` in the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `r` remains unchanged.
   - `prev` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is updated to `i + 1`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `i + 1` if `prev` was `i + 1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`r` is an input string, `prev` is either `i` or `i+1`, `i` is `i+1`, and `n` is greater than `i+1` if `prev` is `i+1`**.
