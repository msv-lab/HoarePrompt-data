Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (since the range function in Python is exclusive of the upper bound).

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `r` is an input string.
   - If `r` equals '>', then `prev` is an input integer.
   - If `r` equals '=', then `r2` is the input string from the user, and if `r2` equals '<', then `prev` is set to `i`.

4. **Analyze the loop body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know it increments `i` by 1 each time it runs.

5. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value within the range `[1, n-1]`.
   - After the loop increments `i` by 1, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be within the range `[1, n-1]`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Since `i` was in the range `[1, n-1]` at the end of the previous iteration, after incrementing `i` by 1, `i` will now be in the range `[2, n-1]` (if `i` was `n-1` before, the loop will stop).

Therefore, the new state should be:

**State: **`r` is an input string, if `r` equals '>', then `prev` is an input integer, if `r` equals '=', then `r2` is the input string from the user, and if `r2` equals '<', then `prev` is set to `i+1`, `i` is `i+1`, `n` must be greater than `i+1`**.
