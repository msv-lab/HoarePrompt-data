Output State: **`prev` is `n-1`, `i` is `3`, `n` must be greater than `3`, `v2` is `3`, `v1` is `2`, `g` is `0`, `r` is an input string**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or states. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered data is written out to the console. Since no variables are modified, the initial state remains unchanged.
