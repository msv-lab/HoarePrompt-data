Postcondition: **`res` is a list where if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1, then `a[i]` is added to `res`, making `res` contain `['a[i]']`. `re` is equal to `k`, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `i` is still less than `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0. If `l[a[i] - 1]` was not 1, then `res`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.**
