Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `re` is 0.
   - `ul` is 0.
   - `ur` is 0.
   - `i` is `2 * n`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `res` is an empty list.
   - `l` is a list of length `n` where each element is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `r[j]` being 2 during the loop's iterations for `i` in the range `[n, n-1]`.
   - The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

2. **Understanding the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.
   - This means it will print the value of `a[i]` twice followed by a space.

3. **Determining the Value of `a[i]`:**
   - Since `i` is set to `2 * n`, and the range of the loop is `[n, n-1]`, `i` will be greater than the length of the list `a` (assuming `n` is the length of `a`).
   - Therefore, `a[i]` is out of bounds and will raise an IndexError if accessed directly. However, since we need to determine what would be printed, we consider the context and the fact that the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2.
   - Given that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, it implies that `a[i] - 1` must be within the valid range of the list `l`, meaning `a[i]` should be `3` because `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2 and `l` is of length `n`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The value of `a[i]` is `3` (since `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, implying `a[i] - 1 = 2` hence `a[i] = 3`).

Therefore, the print statement will output `3 3` followed by a space.

Output: **3 3**
