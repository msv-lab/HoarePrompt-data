Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the range from `n` to `2 * n`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2.
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `ur` is equal to `ur` + 2.
   - If the current value of `ul` is equal to `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n + k - 1` (where `k` is the number of iterations so far).
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `n + k`.
   - The condition `i < 2 * n` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n + k`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, and `ur` is equal to `ur` + 2. If the current value of `ul` is equal to `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `i` is `n + k`, where `k` is the number of iterations so far, and `n` remains the same.**

For simplicity, let's assume `k = 1` for the first iteration after the previous state:

State: **`r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, and `ur` is equal to `ur` + 2. If the current value of `ul` is equal to `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` remains the same.**

Final Answer:
State: **`r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, and `ur` is equal to `ur` + 2. If the current value of `ul` is equal to `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` remains the same.**
