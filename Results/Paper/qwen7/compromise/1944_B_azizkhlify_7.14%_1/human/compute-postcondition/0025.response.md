Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `res` is an empty list.
   - `re` is 0.
   - `ul` is 0.
   - `ur` is 0.
   - `i` must be `n`.
   - For each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know that `i` must be `n`. Therefore, we need to determine the value of `a[n]`.

Given that `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2 for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, it implies that the value of `a[i] - 1` must be such that `l` at that index is 2. Since this condition holds for all `i` in the range `n` to `2 * n - 1`, it means that `a[i]` must be 3 for all `i` in this range.

Thus, `a[n]` is 3.

Therefore, the print statement will output `3 3`.

Output: **3 3**
