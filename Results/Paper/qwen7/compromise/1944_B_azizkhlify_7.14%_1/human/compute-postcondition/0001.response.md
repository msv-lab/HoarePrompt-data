Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `k` is an integer equal to the second number entered**.

Explanation: The code takes two integers as input separated by a space, splits them, and assigns them to `n` and `k`. Since the exact numbers are not specified, `n` and `k` are represented as integers equal to the respective numbers entered. All other variables remain unaffected by this operation.
