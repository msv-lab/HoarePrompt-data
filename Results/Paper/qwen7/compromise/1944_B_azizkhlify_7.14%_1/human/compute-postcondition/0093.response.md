Output State: `re` is `k + 1`, `i` is the third element of `res`, `res` contains the elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 until `re` reaches `k + 1`.

This means after all the iterations of the loop have finished, `re` will be `k + 1`, `i` will be set to the third element of `res`, and `res` will contain the elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 until `re` reaches `k + 1`.
