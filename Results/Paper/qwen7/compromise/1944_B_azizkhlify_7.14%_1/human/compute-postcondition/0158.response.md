Postcondition: `re` is 0, `ul` is either 2 or 2 * `k`, `ur` is 0, `i` is `2 * n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `res` is an empty list, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `r[j]` being 2 during the loop's iterations for `i` in the range `[n, n-1]`. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, then `ul` is set to `2 * k` and we break out of the loop. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.
