Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `res` must contain elements, `ul` is equal to `ur`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or condition where `r[a[i] - 1]` was being checked to increment `ur` by 2 if it equals 2. The values of `ul` and `ur` remain unchanged unless they were modified within the loop or condition that was just broken from. All other variables retain their previous states.
