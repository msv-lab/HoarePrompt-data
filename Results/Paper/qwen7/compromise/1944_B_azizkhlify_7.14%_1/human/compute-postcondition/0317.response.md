Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` remains the same (though its value is not explicitly given, it doesn't affect the current print statement).
- `re` is equal to `k` if the element at index `a[0] - 1` in list `l` is equal to 1, and `res` contains the element `a[0]`.
- Otherwise, `re` is not equal to `k` and `res` does not contain any specific value.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

Let's break this down:

1. `i` is 1.
2. Therefore, `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`.

The value of `a[1]` is not explicitly given, but since no other information about `a` is provided, we cannot determine its exact value. However, the question asks us to provide the most precise description possible based on the given information.

Given the initial state, the print statement will output the value of `a[1]`.

Output: **a[1]**
