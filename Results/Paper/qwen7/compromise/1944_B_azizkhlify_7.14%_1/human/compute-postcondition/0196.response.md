Output State: **`i` is 2, `res` contains the element `a[1]`, `l[a[1] - 1]` equals 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. Since no changes are made to the variables `i`, `res`, or `l[a[1] - 1]` within the scope of the given code snippet, their values remain unchanged. The only effect is that the execution exits the loop or if statement.
