Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the object `res`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `res` contains at least one element.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `res` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `res` must still contain at least one element.
   - Since the loop is iterating over elements in `res`, `i` will take the value of the current element in `res`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The state of `i` will change with each iteration, but the key condition for the loop to continue is that `res` must still contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
**`res` must contain at least one element**.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`res` must contain at least one element**
