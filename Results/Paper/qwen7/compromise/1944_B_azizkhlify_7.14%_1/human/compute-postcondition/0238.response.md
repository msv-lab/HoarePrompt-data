Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be less than or equal to the length of `res`, `ul` is equal to `ur` + 2, and the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this context, it means that the loop or case being executed will terminate. However, since no variables are modified within the given code snippet, the values of `i`, `n`, `ul`, `ur`, `r`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
