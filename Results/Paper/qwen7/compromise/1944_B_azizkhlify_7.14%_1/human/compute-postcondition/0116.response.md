Output State: **`ur` is 2 more than its original value.**

Explanation: The code `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. Since the initial value of `ur` is not specified, we express the new value of `ur` as 2 more than its original value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
