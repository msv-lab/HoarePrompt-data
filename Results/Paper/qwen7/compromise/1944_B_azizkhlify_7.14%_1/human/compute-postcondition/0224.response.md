Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the initial state, we know that `i` is `n - 1`.
2. We also know that `n` must be less than or equal to the length of `res`.
3. Additionally, the current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Explanation:
- `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`.
- Since `i` is `n - 1`, `a[i]` is the last element in the list `a`.
- The `print` function will print the value of `a[i]` twice because it appears twice in the argument list.
- The `end=' '` parameter ensures that there is a space after the two printed values, but no newline.

Given that `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, this information is not directly used in the `print` statement but helps confirm the state of the program.

Therefore, the output will be the value of the last element in the list `a`, repeated twice, followed by a space.

Output: **[a[n-1]] [a[n-1]]**
