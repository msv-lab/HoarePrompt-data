Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` must be less than or equal to the length of `res`
- `ul` is equal to `ur`
- The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop starts with `i = n` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `2 * n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 1`.

### Next Iteration
- For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 from `n - 1` to `n`.
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n`.

### Adjusting States
- The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
- The value of `i` will be `n` at the start of the next iteration.
- The other variables (`n`, `res`, `ul`, `ur`, `a`, `r`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop head.

### Updated State
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be less than or equal to the length of `res`, `ul` is equal to `ur`, and the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged.**
