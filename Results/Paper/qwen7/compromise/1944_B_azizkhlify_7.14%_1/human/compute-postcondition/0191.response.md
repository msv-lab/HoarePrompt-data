Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `res` contains the element `a[i]` (which means `res` contains `a[0]`).
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1 (which means `l[0]` equals 1).
   - There is a postcondition that if `re` equals `k`, the process breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, so `n` stays the same.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `i` changes to 1.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged.
   - The state of `res` and `l` does not change because they are not directly modified by the loop head.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - The new state should reflect the updated value of `i`.
   - The other variables (`res` and `l`) remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `res` contains the element `a[i]` and `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, and if `re` equals `k`, the process breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
