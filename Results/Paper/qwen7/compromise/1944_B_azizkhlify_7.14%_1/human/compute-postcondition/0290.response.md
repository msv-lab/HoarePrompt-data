Output State: **`i` is increased by 1 from its previous value (`i_new`), `n` remains the same, and `ul` remains the same.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this context, it does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, or `ul`. The `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value (`i_new`), `n` remains the same, and `ul` is either increased by 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, or remains the same otherwise. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, the conditions for `i` and `ul` remain unchanged.
