Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i < 2 * n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is an empty list.
   - `re` is 0.
   - `ul` is 0.
   - `ur` is 0.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `r[a[i-1]]` is incremented by 1 (Note: This is a detail from the previous iteration but not directly relevant to the loop head).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2 * n`. Therefore, `i` should be `n + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `res` remains an empty list.
   - `re` remains 0.
   - `ul` remains 0.
   - `ur` remains 0.
   - `i` is now `n + 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`res` is an empty list, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`**
