Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `res` contains the element `a[i]` which means `res` contains `a[1]`.
- `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, so `l[a[1] - 1]` equals 1. This implies that `a[1] - 1` is an index in list `l` and the value at that index is 1.
- The condition `if re == k:` does not affect the print statement directly since it's outside the context of the print statement itself.

Given this, the print statement `print(a[i], end=' ')` will print the value of `a[1]`.

Output: **a[1]**
