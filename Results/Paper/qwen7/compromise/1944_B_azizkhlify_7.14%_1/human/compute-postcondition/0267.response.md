Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` in the range `range(n, 2 * n)`. This means `i` should start from `n` and go up to `2 * n - 1`.

3. **Determine the Initial Value of `n`**: Since the loop starts with `i = n`, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to start.

4. **Adjust the State**: Based on the above points, we need to adjust the initial values of `i` and `n` such that the loop can start executing. Specifically, `i` should be set to `n` and `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts should be:

**State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**
