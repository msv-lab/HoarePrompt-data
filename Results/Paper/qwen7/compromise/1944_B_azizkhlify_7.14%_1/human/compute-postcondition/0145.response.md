Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i < 2 * n`.
2. **Current State of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_prev + 1`.

### Next Iteration
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range `[n, 2 * n)`.
- Since `i` is currently `i_prev + 1`, the next value of `i` would be `i_prev + 2`.

### Adjusting States
- **Variable `i`**: It needs to be set to `i_prev + 2`.
- **Variable `n`**: This variable is not modified within the loop, so it remains unchanged.

### Final State
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 (this state does not change as it is not part of the loop head).
- `i` is now `i_prev + 2`.
- `n` remains unchanged.

### Updated State
State: **`r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i_prev + 2`**
