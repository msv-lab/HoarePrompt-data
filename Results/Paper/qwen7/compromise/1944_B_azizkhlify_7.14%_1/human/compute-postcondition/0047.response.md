Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `re` is 0, `ul` is 4, `ur` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no variables are updated or affected by the `break` statement, the values of `res`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `i`, and `n` remain the same as their initial values.
