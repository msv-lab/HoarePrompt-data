Output State: **`i` is `n`, `res` must contain elements, `ul` is not equal to `ur`, and the current value of `ur` is `ur + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still `n`, `res` must still contain elements, `ul` is still not equal to `ur`, and the new value of `ur` is its original value plus 2.
