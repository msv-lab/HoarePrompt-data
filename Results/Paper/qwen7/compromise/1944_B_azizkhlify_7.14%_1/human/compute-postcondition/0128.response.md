Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `re` is `k + 1`, `i` is `2 * n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `res` contains the elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `ur` is increased by `2 * n` for each iteration where `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, and `num_iterations` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from input and splits it into a list of integers, assigning it to the variable `a`. The values of `n`, `k`, `re`, `i`, `res`, `ur`, and `num_iterations` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `a` now holds the list of integers read from input.
