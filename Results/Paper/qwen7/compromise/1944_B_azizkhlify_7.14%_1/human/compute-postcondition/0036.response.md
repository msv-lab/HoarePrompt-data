Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `re` is 0, `ul` is 4, `ur` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ul += 2` increments the value of `ul` by 2. Given that `ul` was initially `2 * k`, and since `k` is not defined, we use its initial value which is `0` (as no other value is provided), making `ul` equal to `0`. After adding `2`, `ul` becomes `2`. The other variables (`res`, `re`, `ur`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
