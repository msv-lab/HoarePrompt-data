Given the initial state:
- `i` is 4

The code snippet is:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

Here, `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Since `i` is 4, `a[i]` would refer to the element at index 4 in the list `a`.

However, the list `a` itself is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i]` without knowing the contents of the list `a`.

Output: **a[4]**
