Output State: **`l` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `re` is `k + 1`, `i` is `2 * n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `res` contains the elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `ur` is increased by `2 * n` for each iteration where `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, and `num_iterations` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes `l` as a list of length `n` filled with zeros. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
