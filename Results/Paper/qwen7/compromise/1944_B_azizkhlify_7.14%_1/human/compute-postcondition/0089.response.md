Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `re` is set to `k + 1`.
   - `i` is the first element of `res`.
   - `res` contains elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 until `re` reaches `k + 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(i, end=' ')`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `re` is explicitly given as `k + 1`.
- `i` is the first element of `res`.
- `res` is constructed such that it includes elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, up to the point where `re` becomes `k + 1`.

Since the print statement only prints `i`, we need to focus on the value of `i`.

Given that `i` is the first element of `res`, and `res` is constructed based on the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, the value of `i` depends on the specific values of `a` and `l`. However, without the explicit values of `a` and `l`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `i`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the first element of `res`, which is `i`.

Output: **i (where i is the first element of res)**
