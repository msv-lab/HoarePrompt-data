Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n, 2 * n)`. The key variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `res` must contain elements.
   - `ul` is equal to `ur`.

3. **Check the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n + 1` and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n + 2`.

5. **Verify if the loop should continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < 2 * n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently `n + 1`, the next value `n + 2` is still within the range `n` to `2 * n` (assuming `n` is a positive integer).

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `n + 2`.
   - The other variables (`res`, `ul`, `ur`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `res` must contain elements, and `ul` is equal to `ur`**.
