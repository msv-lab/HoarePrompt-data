Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers where each element has been processed according to the conditions inside the loop, `ans` is False, `i` is 0.**

The code `m = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `m`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is less than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is False, and `i` is 0 remains valid after the code execution.
