Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). For each test case, it checks if the sequence of integers can be rearranged such that for every pair of consecutive elements, the first element is not less than the second element. If such a rearrangement is possible, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
