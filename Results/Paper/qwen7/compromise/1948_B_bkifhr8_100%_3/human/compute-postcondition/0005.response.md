State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is True, `i` is m - 1**

### Explanation:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is initialized to `m - 1`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i > 0` (since the step is `-1`). Therefore, `i` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. This means `m - 1` must be at least 1, implying `m` must be at least 2.

So, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `m` is at least 2, and `i` is set to `m - 1` at the start of the loop.
