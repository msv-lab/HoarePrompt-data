Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` remains False, `i` is `m - 2`, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to be the first element of `nums`, where `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` shifted by one and the current element of `arr`, and if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i]` remains unchanged.**
