Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `m` must be at least 1
   - `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user
   - `ans` is False
   - `i` is `m - 2`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts with `i = m - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` reaches 0.

4. **Loop Body (Omitted):**
   - If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` is set to False and `i` is decremented by 1.
   - If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` remains True and `i` remains `m - 1`.

5. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since the loop is decrementing `i` from `m - 1` to 0, the next value of `i` will be `m - 2` if the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is not met.
   - If the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is met, `i` will be decremented further, but since we are asked to determine the state for the next iteration, we assume it does not meet the condition (as per typical loop continuation logic).

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `arr` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `ans` remains False as no condition would change it in this context.
   - `i` will be `m - 2` if the condition is not met, or `m - 3` if the condition is met, but we assume it does not meet the condition for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` is False, `i` is `m - 2`**
