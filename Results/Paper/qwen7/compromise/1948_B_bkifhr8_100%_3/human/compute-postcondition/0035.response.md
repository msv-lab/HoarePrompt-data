Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `m` is an input integer that must be at least 3.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.
- `ans` remains `False`.
- `i` is 0.
- The loop has completed all its iterations.

The print statement is:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

Given that `ans` remains `False`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` will evaluate to `'NO'` because the index `[ans]` is `0` (since `ans` is `False`, which is equivalent to `0` in a boolean context).

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
