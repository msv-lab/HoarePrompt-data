Output State: **`ans` is False, `i` is `m - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no loop or conditional block was specified in the code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `ans`, `i`, and `nums` remain unchanged.
