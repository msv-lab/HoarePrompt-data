Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers, the element at index `i-1` is now equal to the first element of `nums`, `ans` remains False, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr` transformed into a list of integers, and `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to the first element of `nums`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to the first element of `nums`.
