Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` remains False, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list containing the integer value of the last element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[i]`) concatenated with the integer value of the element before it (i.e., `arr[i-1]`).**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `nums` by converting the last element of `arr` (which is `arr[i]`) to an integer and concatenating it with the integer value of the element before it (`arr[i-1]`). The other variables remain unchanged.
