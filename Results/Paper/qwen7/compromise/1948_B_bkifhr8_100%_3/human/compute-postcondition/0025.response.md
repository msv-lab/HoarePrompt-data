Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.
   - `ans` remains False.
   - `i` is `m - 2`.
   - `arr[i - 1]` is updated to be the first element of `nums`, where `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` shifted by one and the current element of `arr`.
   - If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i]` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
   ```

3. **Loop Iteration Analysis:**
   - The loop starts with `i = m - 1` and decrements `i` until `i` is 0.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `m - 2`.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is decrementing `i`, the next value of `i` will be `m - 3`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be greater than 0.
   - All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `ans`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `m` remains the same.
   - `arr` remains the same unless modified within the loop.
   - `ans` remains False.
   - `i` is now `m - 3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` remains False, `i` is `m - 3`**.
