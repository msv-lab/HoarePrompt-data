Output State: **`ans` remains False, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr` transformed into a list of integers, and `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to the first element of `nums`.**

Explanation: The code updates `arr[i - 1]` to be the first element of `nums`. Since `nums` is defined as a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr` transformed into a list of integers, the value of `arr[i - 1]` is now the first element of `nums`. The other variables (`ans` and `i`) remain unchanged.
