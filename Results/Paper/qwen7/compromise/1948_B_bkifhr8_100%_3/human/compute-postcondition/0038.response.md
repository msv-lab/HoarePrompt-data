Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` remains False, `i` is 1, `arr` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the split input.**

The code updates the `arr` variable to a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
