Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string
   - `ans` is False
   - `i` is `m - 1`
   - If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]` followed by `arr[i]`; otherwise, `ans` remains True.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts at `m - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 0.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `m - 2`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `n`, `m`, `arr`, `ans`, and `t` are not directly affected by the loop itself and remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

5. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than 0.
   - Since `i` starts at `m - 1` and decreases by 1 each iteration, the loop will continue until `i` becomes 0.

6. **Final State Before Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be `m - 2`.
   - All other variables (`n`, `m`, `arr`, `ans`, `t`) remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state before the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is False, `i` is `m - 2`**.
