Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    ans = True
    for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
            if nums != sorted(nums):
                ans = False
                break
            arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
    print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` remains False, `i` is 0, and the loop has completed all its iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is less than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers where each element has been processed according to the conditions inside the loop, `ans` is False, `i` is 0, `nums` is no longer defined as it is only used within the loop.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will eventually reach 0 because the loop starts from `m-1` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration. The loop breaks when the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false for all possible `i` values, meaning the array `arr` is non-decreasing or the loop couldn't find any such pair. Since `ans` is set to False as soon as the condition is violated, it remains False. The variable `nums` is only defined and used within the loop, so it is no longer defined after the loop completes.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` remains False, `i` is -1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
