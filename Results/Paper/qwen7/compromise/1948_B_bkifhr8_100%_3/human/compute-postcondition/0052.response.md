Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers, the element at index `i-1` is now equal to the first element of `nums`, `ans` is False, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr` transformed into a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]` takes the element at index `i-1` from `arr`, converts it to a string, splits it into individual characters (each character being a string), converts each character back to an integer, and then appends the integer value of `arr[i]` to the end of this list. This updated list is then assigned to `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged.
