Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is False, `i` is `m - 1`, and if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]` followed by `arr[i]`; otherwise, `ans` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` remains False, `i` is `m - 2`, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to be the first element of `nums`, where `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` shifted by one and the current element of `arr`, and if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` remains False, `i` is `m - 3`, and if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then the condition is checked and the loop or statement is exited if `nums` is not sorted. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, the condition is not met, and no further changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
