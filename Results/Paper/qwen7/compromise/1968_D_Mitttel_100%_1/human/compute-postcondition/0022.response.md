Output State: `mx` is the maximum value encountered during all iterations of the loop, `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` added in each iteration until `k` becomes 0, `k` is 0, `vis[s]` is 1, and `s` is updated to `p[s]` in each iteration until `vis[s]` becomes 1 or `k` becomes 0.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `mx` will hold the highest value of `cur + k * a[s]` seen during any iteration, `cur` will be the cumulative sum of `a[s]` from the start until `k` is depleted, `k` will be 0 as it is decremented with each iteration, `vis[s]` will be marked as 1 indicating that the current state `s` has been visited, and `s` will be updated to `p[s]` in each iteration until the condition `not vis[s] and k > 0` no longer holds true.
