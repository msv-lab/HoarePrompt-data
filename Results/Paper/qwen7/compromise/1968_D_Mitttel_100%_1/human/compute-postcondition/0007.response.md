Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of 0 and `cur` + `k` * `a[s]`, `cur` is `cur` + `a[s]`, `vis[s]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `cur += a[s]` increments the value of `cur` by `a[s]`. The initial value of `cur` is 0, so after executing this line, `cur` becomes `0 + a[s]`, which simplifies to `cur + a[s]`. The other variables (`mx` and `vis[s]`) remain unchanged.
