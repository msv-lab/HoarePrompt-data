Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of 0 and `cur` + `k` * `a[s]`, `cur` is `cur` + `a[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1, `vis[s]` is 1, `s` is updated to `p[s]`**.

This means that the variable `s` is updated to the value of `p[s]`, while the other variables retain their previous relationships and values as described in the initial state.
