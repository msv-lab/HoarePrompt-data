Output State: `mx` is the maximum value encountered during all iterations of the loop, `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` accumulated during all iterations, `k` is 0 (since it is decremented until it reaches 0), `vis[s]` is 1 if `s` was visited during any iteration, otherwise it remains 0, and `s` is updated to `p[s]` after each iteration until the condition `not vis[s] and k > 0` no longer holds.

This means that after all iterations, `mx` will hold the highest value of `cur + k * a[s]` seen during any iteration, `cur` will be the total sum of `a[s]` added across all iterations, `k` will be 0 as it gets decremented to 0, `vis[s]` will be marked as 1 for any `s` that was visited, and `s` will point to its final value after the last iteration where the loop condition was still met.
