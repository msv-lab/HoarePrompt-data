Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `not vis[s] and k > 0`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as `vis[s]` is `False` and `k` is greater than `0`.

2. **Current States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `mx` is the maximum of 0 and `cur` + `k` * `a[s]`.
   - `cur` is `cur` + `a[s]`.
   - `k` is decreased by 1.
   - `vis[s]` is 1 (which means `vis[s]` is `True`).
   - `s` is updated to `p[s]`.

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `vis[s]` must be `False` and `k` must be greater than `0`.
   - Since `vis[s]` is `1` (which means `True`), it cannot be `False` without changing its value.
   - Therefore, we need to change `vis[s]` to `0` (or `False`).

4. **Other States**:
   - `k` is already decreased by 1, so it is now `k - 1`.
   - `cur` is updated to `cur + a[s]`.
   - `s` is updated to `p[s]`.

### Final State Adjustment:

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to set `vis[s]` to `False` and keep the other states as they are from the previous iteration.

### Example Answer:

State: **`mx` is the maximum of 0 and `cur` + `k` * `a[s]`, `cur` is `cur` + `a[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1, `vis[s]` is 0, `s` is updated to `p[s]`**
