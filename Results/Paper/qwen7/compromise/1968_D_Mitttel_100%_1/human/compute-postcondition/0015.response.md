Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `cur` + `k` * `a[s]`, `cur` is `cur` + `a[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1 (now `k-1`), `vis[s]` is 1, `s` is updated to `p[s]`**

Explanation: The code `s = p[s]` updates the value of `s` to the value of `p[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
