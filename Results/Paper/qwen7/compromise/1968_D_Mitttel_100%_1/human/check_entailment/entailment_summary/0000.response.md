Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly simulates the game for a single player starting at position `s`.
   - It iterates `k` times, updating the current score `cur` and the maximum score `mx` based on the player's position in the permutation.
   - It uses a `vis` list to ensure no position is revisited, which prevents infinite loops and ensures the simulation is done within the game's constraints.

2. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - The main program correctly reads the input for each test case.
   - It adjusts the indices of the permutation and array `a` by subtracting 1, which is necessary since indices in Python start from 0.
   - It calls `func_1` twice, once for Bodya and once for Sasha, to calculate their respective scores.
   - It compares the scores and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases efficiently by using a loop.
   - The logic for determining the winner is correct and covers all possible outcomes.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all required functionalities without any apparent errors.

Correctness: **True**
