Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for the game. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly account for the possibility of moving to `p[s]` during each turn. Instead of considering both staying at the current position and moving to `p[s]`, the function only considers moving to `p[s]` and does not explore all possible moves.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 2 3 2
  4 1 2 3
  7 2 5 6
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - Bodya starts at position 3.
  - Sasha starts at position 2.
  - After the first turn:
    - Bodya can stay at position 3 or move to position 2.
    - Sasha can stay at position 2 or move to position 1.
  - After the second turn:
    - Bodya can stay at position 3 or move to position 2.
    - Sasha can stay at position 1 or move to position 2.

However, the provided code does not explore these possibilities. It only considers moving to `p[s]` and does not consider staying at the current position, which leads to incorrect results.

For instance, in the given example, the code might incorrectly conclude that Bodya or Sasha has a higher score without fully exploring all possible moves. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
