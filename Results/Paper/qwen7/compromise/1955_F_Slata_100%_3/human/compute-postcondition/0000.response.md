Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`. Therefore, the value of `i` should be less than the result of `int(input())`.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state is given as `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `int(input())` will read an integer from input, and this integer will determine how many times the loop will run.

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since `t` is the upper limit for the number of iterations, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the value of `t`. The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i < int(input())`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring that the loop can execute based on the value of `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `i` must be less than `int(input())`**.
