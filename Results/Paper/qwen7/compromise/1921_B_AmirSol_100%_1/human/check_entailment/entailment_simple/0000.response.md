Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, the initial state of the boxes `s1`, and the desired state of the boxes `s2`.
2. The function `func_1` is called with these parameters.
3. Inside `func_1`, the logic to calculate the minimum number of operations is as follows:
   - `cats_to_add` calculates the number of positions where the initial state `s1` has no cat (`'0'`) but the desired state `s2` requires a cat (`'1'`).
   - `cats_to_remove` calculates the number of positions where the initial state `s1` has a cat (`'1'`) but the desired state `s2` does not require a cat (`'0'`).
4. The function returns the maximum of these two values, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state into the desired state. This is because moving a cat from one box to another counts as one operation, and removing or adding a cat also counts as one operation.

Given this analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve the desired state from the initial state.

Correctness: **True**
