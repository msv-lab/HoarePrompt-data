Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state of the boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`).
2. The proposed solution in the program counts:
   - `cats_to_add`: the number of positions where there is no cat initially but should be present in the final state.
   - `cats_to_remove`: the number of positions where there is a cat initially but should not be present in the final state.
3. The logic in the `func_1` function returns the maximum of these two counts. This is because:
   - To add a cat to a box that needs a cat, we need at least one operation.
   - To remove a cat from a box that should not have a cat, we need at least one operation.
   - Therefore, the total number of operations required will be the sum of the cats to add and the cats to remove, which is effectively the maximum of the two counts since each cat addition or removal operation can be done independently.

Given the execution summary and the logic in the program, the function correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
