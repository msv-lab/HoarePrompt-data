Output State: **`cats_to_add` is equal to the number of positions i where s1[i] is '0' and s2[i] is '1', and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1'.**

Explanation: The code calculates the number of positions where the initial position (`s1`) is '0' and the desired position (`s2`) is '1' by iterating through each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`. For each index where these conditions are met, it increments `cats_to_add` by 1. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged.
