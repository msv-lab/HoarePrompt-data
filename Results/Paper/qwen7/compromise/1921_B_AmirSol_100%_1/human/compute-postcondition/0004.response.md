Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n`, and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It calculates the maximum value between the count of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1', and the count of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'. The function then returns this maximum value.**
