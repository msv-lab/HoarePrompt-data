The function processes a series of integer inputs `t` and `n`. For each `n`, if `n` is odd, it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is even and the generated string 'AAB' repeated `(n // 2)` times is less than 200 characters long, it outputs 'YES' followed by the string. Otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything.
