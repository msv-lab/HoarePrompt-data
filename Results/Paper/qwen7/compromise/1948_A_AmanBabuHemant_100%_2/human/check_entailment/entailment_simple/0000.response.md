Reasoning:
- The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
- It checks if `n` is odd. If so, it prints 'NO', which is correct because an odd number of special characters cannot be formed with the given rules.
- If `n` is even, it constructs the string `s` using `'AAB' * (n // 2)`. This string will have `n` special characters since each 'B' is surrounded by 'A's and thus is a special character, and the 'A's are not special.
- It then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `s`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
- The logic handles all edge cases as per the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution appears to be correct according to the problem description and the execution states provided.

Correctness: **True**
