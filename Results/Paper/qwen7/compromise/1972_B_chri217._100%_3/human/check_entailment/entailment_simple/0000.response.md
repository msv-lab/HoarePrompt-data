Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t` from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - Appends a tuple `(n, s)` to the list `cases`.
   - Returns the list `cases`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - Takes a tuple `case` as input, where `case[0]` is the number of coins `n` and `case[1]` is the string `s` representing the initial state.
   - Counts the number of 'U's (coins facing up) in the string `s` using `sum(1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U')`.
   - Returns 'YES' if the count of 'U's is even, otherwise returns 'NO'.

3. **Main Program**:
   - Calls `func_1` to get the list of test cases.
   - Iterates over each test case and calls `func_2` to determine the winner.
   - Prints the result for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotated program, the logic in `func_2` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of coins facing up. The program reads the input correctly and processes each test case as required.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
