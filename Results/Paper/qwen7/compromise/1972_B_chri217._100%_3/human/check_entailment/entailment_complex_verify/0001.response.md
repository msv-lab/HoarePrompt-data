### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` in a list `cases`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function takes a single test case as an argument.
   - It counts the number of coins that are facing up using a generator expression inside the `sum` function.
   - It returns "YES" if the count of facing-up coins (`ups`) is even, otherwise "NO".
   - However, the function does not actually simulate the game or consider the game rules beyond counting the number of facing-up coins. The game logic described in the problem statement involves removing coins and flipping adjacent coins, which is not implemented in `func_2`.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The game logic described in the problem statement is not correctly implemented in the given code.
   - The function `func_2` simply checks if the number of facing-up coins is even, but it does not simulate the game process or handle the removal and flipping of coins.
   - The game logic involves complex interactions between the players and the coins, which cannot be accurately determined by just counting the number of facing-up coins.

4. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - However, the output is based on an incorrect assumption that the number of facing-up coins being even guarantees Alice's victory, which is not true according to the game rules.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the game logic. While it handles the input/output correctly, the core logic for determining the winner is flawed because it does not simulate the actual game process.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
