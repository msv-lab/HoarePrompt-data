Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: 
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins and the state of the coins. This function returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains the number of coins and the state of the coins as a string.

2. **Determining the Winner**:
   - `func_2` counts the number of coins facing up (`'U'`). If the count of facing-up coins is even, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. This is because each operation reduces the count of facing-up coins by 1 (since a facing-up coin is removed and its adjacent coins are flipped), and the parity (even or odd nature) of the count of facing-up coins determines the winner.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, `func_2` returns "YES" if the count of facing-up coins is even, and "NO" otherwise. This is consistent with the problem statement.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **True**.
