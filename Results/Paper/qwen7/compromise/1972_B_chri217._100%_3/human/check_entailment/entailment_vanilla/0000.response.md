### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` in a list `cases`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function takes a single test case as an argument.
   - It counts the number of coins that are facing up using a generator expression inside the `sum` function.
   - It returns "YES" if the count of facing-up coins (`ups`) is even, otherwise "NO".

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The game logic described in the problem statement is correctly implemented in the `func_2` function.
   - The key point is that if the number of facing-up coins is even, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by playing optimally.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Bob can force Alice into a losing position.

4. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - The output format matches the required format ("YES" or "NO").

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the game logic and handles the input/output as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
