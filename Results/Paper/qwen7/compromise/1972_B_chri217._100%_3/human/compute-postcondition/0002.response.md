Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `case`, which is a list where the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", representing the initial state of each coin (facing up or down). The function returns 'YES' if the count of 'U' in the second element of `case` is even, otherwise 'NO'.**
