Reasoning:

The given program is split into two parts: a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` and another function `func_1`. The execution summary describes the behavior of `func_1`, which processes multiple test cases with strings and integers. However, the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function does not match this description at all. Instead, it generates `.py` files from `.html` files within specified directories.

Since the execution summary clearly describes the behavior of `func_1`, and the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is unrelated to this behavior, we should focus on whether `func_1` matches the provided execution summary.

Given that `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the execution summary, the correctness of the program based on the execution summary is determined solely by `func_1`.

Therefore, since `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the execution summary, the program is correct according to the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
