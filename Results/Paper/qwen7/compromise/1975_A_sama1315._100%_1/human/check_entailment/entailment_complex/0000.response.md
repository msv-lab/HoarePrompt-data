### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `a` and checks if the array can be rearranged to be non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it checks if any substring of the concatenated list (`a + a`) matches the sorted version of `a`. This approach does not correctly determine if the array can be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. The function would incorrectly return 'Yes' because it finds a match in the concatenated list, even though the array cannot be rearranged to be non-decreasing through the specified operation.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The function correctly handles reading input and calling `func_1` for each test case, but since `func_1` is flawed, the overall correctness of the program depends on the accuracy of `func_1`.

3. **Overall Program Correctness:**
   - Since `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be rearranged to be non-decreasing, the entire program will produce incorrect results.
   - The examples provided in the problem statement show that the program should return 'No' for the first test case and 'Yes' for the second and third test cases, but the current implementation of `func_1` will return 'No' for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
Given that `func_1` does not correctly implement the required logic, the overall program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
