Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n positive integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all i.
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is a list of n positive integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all i; `n` is the length of list `a`; `sorted_a` is a list of the same integers as `a` but sorted in non-decreasing order; `concatenated_a` is a list equal to `a + a`; The loop checks if any substring of `concatenated_a` with the same length as `sorted_a` is equal to `sorted_a`. If such a substring is found, it returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it continues checking until all iterations are completed and returns 'No' if no such substring exists.
    return 'No'
    #The program returns 'No'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of positive integers and checks if any substring of the concatenated list (the original list appended to itself) has the same length as the sorted version of the original list. If such a substring is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'. Given the return postconditions, the function will always return 'No'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        result = func_1(a)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `idx` is 2 + 2t, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `results` is a list containing `t` elements where each element is the result of `func_1(a)` for each iteration.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: \n'.join([str(func_1(a))]*t)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from stdin, processes it according to predefined variables `t`, `n`, and `a`, and then calls `func_1` for each set of inputs defined by `t`. It collects the results of these calls into a list and prints them out, separated by newlines. The final state of the program includes the variable `idx` updated to reflect the position in the input data after processing all sets, and the list `results` containing the processed outputs.
