### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
```python
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'
```

1. **Logic of `func_1`:**
   - The function takes an array `a` as input.
   - It creates a sorted version of `a` and concatenates `a` with itself.
   - It then checks if any subarray of the concatenated array matches the sorted version of `a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns `'Yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'No'`.

2. **Issue with `func_1`:**
   - The function checks if the array can be split and rearranged to match a sorted version of itself, but this is not the same as checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping according to the problem description.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. The function would incorrectly return `'Yes'` because it finds a subarray that matches the sorted version, even though the array cannot be made non-decreasing by the specified operations.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
```python
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        result = func_1(a)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))
```

1. **Logic of `func_2`:**
   - The function reads input from standard input, processes it, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It collects the results of `func_1` calls into a list and prints them out.

2. **Issue with `func_2`:**
   - While the function correctly processes multiple test cases, the issue lies in `func_1`, which does not correctly implement the required logic.

#### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, the function needs to check if the array can be split into two parts such that the concatenation of the second part followed by the first part results in a non-decreasing sequence. This requires a more complex logic that iterates through possible splits and checks the resulting sequences.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. Therefore, the final evaluation should be:

Final: **False**
