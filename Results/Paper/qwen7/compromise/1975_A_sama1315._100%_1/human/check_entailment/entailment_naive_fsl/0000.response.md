Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. Specifically, `func_1` checks if the array can be split and rearranged to match a sorted version of itself, but this is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing through the specified operations.

Consider the following example:
- Input: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
- Expected Output: `No`

The function `func_1` will incorrectly return `'Yes'` because it checks if the array can be split and rearranged to match a sorted version, but it does not check if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping according to the problem description.

To correctly solve this problem, the function needs to check if the array can be split into two parts such that the concatenation of the second part followed by the first part results in a non-decreasing sequence. This requires a more complex logic that iterates through possible splits and checks the resulting sequences.
