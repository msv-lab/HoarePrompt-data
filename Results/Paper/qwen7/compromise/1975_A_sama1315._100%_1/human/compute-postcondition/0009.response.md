Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `idx` is defined as `2 + 2t`, where `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`.
   - `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(a)` for each iteration. Here, `a` is not explicitly defined, but it is implied that `a` is the same for each iteration, and `func_1(a)` is applied `t` times.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('\n'.join(results))
   ```

Given this, the `'\n'.join(results)` part of the code will join all the elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). Since `results` contains `t` elements, the output will be `t` lines, each containing the result of `func_1(a)`.

Therefore, the output will be a series of `t` lines, each displaying the result of `func_1(a)`.

Output: **\n'.join([str(func_1(a))]*t)** (where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `func_1(a)` is the result of applying the function `func_1` to `a` for each iteration)
