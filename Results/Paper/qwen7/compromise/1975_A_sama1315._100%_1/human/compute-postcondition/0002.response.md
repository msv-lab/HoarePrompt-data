Output State: **`idx` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is split from the input string.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `idx` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the list `a`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables.
