Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin, processes it according to predefined variables `t`, `n`, and `a`, and then calls `func_1` for each set of inputs defined by `t`. It collects the results of these calls into a list and prints them out, separated by newlines. The final state of the program includes the variable `idx` updated to reflect the position in the input data after processing all sets, and the list `results` containing the processed outputs.**
