### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The goal is to output the coordinates of these cells.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The function `func()` takes input for the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).
   - It prints the coordinates of the first two cells as (1, 1) and (1, 2).
   - Then, it iterates from 3 to \( n \) and prints each cell's coordinates as (i, i).

3. **Checking the Output**:
   - For small values of \( n \), let's check if the output matches the expected results:
     - For \( n = 2 \):
       - The output is:
         ```
         1 1
         1 2
         3 3
         ```
       - The Manhattan distances are:
         - Distance between (1, 1) and (1, 2): \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
         - Distance between (1, 1) and (3, 3): \( |1-3| + |1-3| = 4 \)
         - Distance between (1, 2) and (3, 3): \( |1-3| + |2-3| = 3 \)
       - The set of distances is \(\{1, 3, 4\}\), which has 3 elements.
       - The maximum possible set of distances for \( n = 2 \) is \(\{0, 1\}\), so the output is incorrect.

     - For \( n = 3 \):
       - The output is:
         ```
         1 1
         1 2
         3 3
         4 4
         5 5
         ```
       - The Manhattan distances include:
         - Distance between (1, 1) and (1, 2): \( 1 \)
         - Distance between (1, 1) and (3, 3): \( 4 \)
         - Distance between (1, 1) and (4, 4): \( 7 \)
         - Distance between (1, 1) and (5, 5): \( 8 \)
         - Distance between (1, 2) and (3, 3): \( 3 \)
         - Distance between (1, 2) and (4, 4): \( 6 \)
         - Distance between (1, 2) and (5, 5): \( 7 \)
         - Distance between (3, 3) and (4, 4): \( 2 \)
         - Distance between (3, 3) and (5, 5): \( 3 \)
         - Distance between (4, 4) and (5, 5): \( 1 \)
       - The set of distances is \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8\}\), which has 7 elements.
       - The maximum possible set of distances for \( n = 3 \) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), so the output is incorrect.

4. **General Case**:
   - The program does not consider all possible configurations to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances.
   - The proposed solution only considers a specific pattern which does not always yield the maximum set of distances.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all test cases. Therefore, the correctness is:

**False**
