Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it only works for certain values of \( n \) and does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \( n \). For instance, consider \( n = 3 \):

The optimal arrangement for \( n = 3 \) should include cells such as \((2,1)\), \((2,3)\), and \((3,1)\) to achieve the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) as \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\). However, the provided program prints \((1,1)\) and \((1,2)\) first, followed by a sequence of cells where the \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates are equal, which does not necessarily cover all required Manhattan distances for \( n = 3 \).

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirement of maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \( n \), making it incorrect.
