Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 6, `n` is greater than or equal to 6.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be 6 (since the loop starts from 3 and increments `i` by 1 each time, and it will continue until `i` reaches `n`). The value of `n` must be at least 6 for the loop to run all its iterations. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
