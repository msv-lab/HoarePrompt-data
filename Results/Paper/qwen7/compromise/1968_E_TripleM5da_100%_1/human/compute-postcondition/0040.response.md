Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be at least 13.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will increment to match the value of `n`. The loop starts with `i` being 3 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `n`. Given that the loop runs for a total of 3 iterations initially and each iteration increases `i` by 1, the smallest possible value for `n` is 13 (since `i` starts at 3 and needs to reach `n` through 3 iterations). Therefore, at the end of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`, while `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
