Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\)
   - `i` is 12
   - `n` must be at least 9

2. **Loop Head**: 
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(0, int(input())):`

3. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over a range starting from 0 up to `int(input()) - 1`.
   - Each iteration increments `i` by 1.

4. **Current State**:
   - `i` is currently 12.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `int(input())`.

5. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 13.
   - To continue the loop, `int(input())` must be greater than 13.

6. **Adjusting the States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it must be less than `int(input())`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to 13, and `int(input())` must be greater than 13.

Given these steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 13, `n` must be at least 14.**
