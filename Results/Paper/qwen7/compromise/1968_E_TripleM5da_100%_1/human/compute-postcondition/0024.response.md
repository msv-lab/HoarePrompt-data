Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 12, `n` must be at least 9.

Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 3` to `i = n`. Each iteration increments `i` by 1. After 3 iterations, `i` becomes 9. Since the loop continues until `i` reaches `n`, and given that `i` starts from 3 and increments by 1 each time, after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`. In the last iteration before exiting the loop, `i` will be incremented one more time than `n - 3`, making it `n + 1 - 3 = n - 2` at the end of the loop. However, since the loop prints `i` just before incrementing, the final value of `i` printed will be `n - 1`. Given the initial `i` is 7, after 3 iterations `i` is 9, and it continues to increment until it reaches `n`. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be `n`. But since we are asked for the state right after the loop completes, `i` will be `n`, which translates to `i` being 12 based on the progression from the initial state where `i` was 7. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
