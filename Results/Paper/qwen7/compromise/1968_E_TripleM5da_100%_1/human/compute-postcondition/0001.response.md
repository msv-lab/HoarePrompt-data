Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user. The input value must be a non-negative integer, and the range of `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) is still valid as no operations were performed on `t`.
