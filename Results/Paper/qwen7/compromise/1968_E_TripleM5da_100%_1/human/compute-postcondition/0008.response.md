Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `3` to `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\)
   - `i` is 4
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 4

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 4, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 5 (since the loop iterates from 3 to `n + 1`).
   - Therefore, `i` will become 5.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 5.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5**
