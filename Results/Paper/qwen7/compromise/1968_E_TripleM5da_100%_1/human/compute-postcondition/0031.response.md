Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `3` to `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: From the given state, `i` is initially set to `13`.

3. **Determine the Range Conditions**: The loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from `3` up to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least `13` because the loop starts from `3` and goes up to `n + 1`, meaning `n` must be at least `13` to include `13` in the range.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing. Therefore, we need to adjust the initial value of `i` to match the starting point of the range (`3`) and ensure that `n` is at least `13`.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` should be `3` (the starting point of the range).
- `n` must be at least `13` to include `13` in the range.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 13**.
