Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. Since no other operations are performed on `t`, `x`, `n`, or `ans`, their initial states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `ans` and retains the initial conditions of `t`, `x`, and `n`.
