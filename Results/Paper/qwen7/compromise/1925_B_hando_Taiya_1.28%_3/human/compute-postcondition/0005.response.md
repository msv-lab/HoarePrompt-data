Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\).
- `ans` is the maximum value between `i` and `x // i` for which either `n` ≤ `x // i` or `n` ≤ `i`, where the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to the integer square root of `x`.

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the logic:

1. The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to the integer square root of `x`.
2. For each `i`, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `n` is less than or equal to `i`.
3. It keeps track of the maximum value between `i` and `x // i` that satisfies one of these conditions.

The key point here is that `ans` is determined by the loop, but without knowing the specific values of `x` and `n`, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` is the maximum value found during the loop.

Given this, the output will be the value of `ans`, which is the maximum value between `i` and `x // i` for which either `n` ≤ `x // i` or `n` ≤ `i`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum value between i and x // i for which either n ≤ x // i or n ≤ i, during the loop iteration from 1 to the integer square root of x)**
