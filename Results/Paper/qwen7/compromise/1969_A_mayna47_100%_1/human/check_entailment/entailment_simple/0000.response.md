Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and constructs a list `v` where `v[i]` represents the best friend of the `i-th` friend.
3. The program then checks if there exists any pair of friends who are each other's best friends (`v[v[i]] == i`). If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns, indicating that only two invitations are needed.
4. If no such pair is found, the program incorrectly prints `3` without further checking or logic to determine the minimum number of invitations required.

Given the example and the problem statement, the program should check for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and print `2` if such a pair exists. If no such pair exists, the program should find the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least two friends come to the party.

The current implementation does not correctly handle the scenario where no pair of friends are each other's best friends. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
