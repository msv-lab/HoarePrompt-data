Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, p is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the list `p` is still defined with the same conditions as before. Therefore, `t` retains its original range, `n` is updated to the input integer within the specified range, and the list `p` is yet to be defined but will follow the given constraints.
