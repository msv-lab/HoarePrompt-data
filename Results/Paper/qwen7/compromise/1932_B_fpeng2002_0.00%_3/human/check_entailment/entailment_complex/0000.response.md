Reasoning:
The annotated program describes a function that correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles multiple test cases by using a while loop that decrements `num_tests` until it reaches zero. This ensures that all test cases are processed.

2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, the function reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. This is done correctly using `input()` and splitting the input string into a list of integers.

3. **Initialization**: The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This is the correct starting point because the first sign can occur in any year, and we start counting from the beginning.

4. **Computation**: The core logic of the function iterates over the list of periodicities in reverse order (from the last element to the first). For each periodicity `a_i`, it updates `start_year` using the formula:
   \[
   \text{start\_year} = \left\lceil \frac{\text{start\_year} + 1}{a_i} \right\rceil \times a_i
   \]
   This formula ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The ceiling function is implicitly handled by the integer division and multiplication operations in Python.

5. **Output**: After processing all periodicities for a test case, the function prints the final value of `start_year`, which represents the year when all signs will occur sequentially.

Given that the logic matches the problem description and the provided example, the function correctly computes the desired output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
