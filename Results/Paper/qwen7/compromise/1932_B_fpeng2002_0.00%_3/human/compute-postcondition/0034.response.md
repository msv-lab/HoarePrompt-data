Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `x` and `nums`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `x` is the loop variable, and it starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `nums` is a list of integers.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `x` is less than `len(nums)`.
   - Therefore, the loop will run until `x` reaches the length of `nums`.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**:
   - Since `x` starts at 0 and increments, the loop will execute if `len(nums)` is at least 1.
   - The initial value of `x` should be 0, and `len(nums)` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other given states**:
   - `num_tests` is decreased by 1, but this does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `n` is an input integer, but it is not used in the loop.
   - `start_year` is 0, but it is not relevant to the loop execution.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` and `nums`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element**
