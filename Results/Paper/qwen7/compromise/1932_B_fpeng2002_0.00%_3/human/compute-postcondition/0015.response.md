To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head, specifically the condition `num_tests > 0`.

Given the loop condition `num_tests > 0`, the loop can execute one more time if `num_tests` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

- `start_year` is `((((((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]) + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`
- `x` is 2
- `len(nums)` is the length of the `nums` list
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces

Since the loop condition depends solely on `num_tests`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `num_tests`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

State: **`num_tests` must be greater than 0**
