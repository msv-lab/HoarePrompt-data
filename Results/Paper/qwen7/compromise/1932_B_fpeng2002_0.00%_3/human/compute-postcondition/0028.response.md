Based on the initial state provided:

- `num_tests` is greater than -1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element.
- `start_year` is updated to `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]`.

The key part here is the update to `start_year`. The formula used to update `start_year` is:

\[ \text{start\_year} = \left( \left( \text{start\_year} + 1 \right) // \text{nums}[len(\text{nums})-1] + 1 \right) * \text{nums}[len(\text{nums})-1] \]

This formula ensures that `start_year` is adjusted to the next multiple of the last element in the `nums` list after performing the specified arithmetic operations.

Given this, the value of `start_year` after the update will be based on the last element of the `nums` list. Since the exact values of `start_year` and `nums` are not provided, we can only describe the final value of `start_year` in terms of these variables.

Output: **the value of start_year after being updated according to the formula ((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]**
