Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than -1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `nums` by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer. The original values of `num_tests` and `n` remain unchanged. The new list `nums` contains the integers obtained from the split input.
