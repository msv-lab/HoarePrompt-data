The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. For the loop to execute the first time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

Given that `num_tests` is an input integer and the range is 1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000, the initial condition of `num_tests` being greater than 0 is already satisfied within this range. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for the loop to proceed.

State: **`num_tests` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000**
