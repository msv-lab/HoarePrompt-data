Output State: `start_year` is ((((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2], `x` is 2, `len(nums)` is the length of the `nums` list, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `start_year` will be updated as follows: starting from the initial value, it undergoes a series of operations where for each element in the `nums` list (from the first to the last), it is adjusted according to the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This process is repeated for every element in the list, effectively chaining these adjustments together.
