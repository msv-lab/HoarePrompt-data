Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `start_year` is \(((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]\)
- `x` is 0
- `len(nums)` is the length of the `nums` list
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for x in range(0, len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `x` starts from 0 and goes up to `len(nums) - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was 0.
- For the next iteration, `x` will be incremented by 1, so `x` will become 1.

### Adjusting the State
- Since `x` is being incremented, the new value of `x` will be 1.
- The expression for `start_year` is dependent on the value of `x` and the list `nums`. However, since `x` is changing, we need to update the expression for `start_year` based on the new value of `x`.

Given that `x` is now 1, the updated expression for `start_year` will be:
\[ \text{start_year} = \left(\left(\text{start_year} + 1\right) // \text{nums}[1] + 1\right) * \text{nums}[1] \]

### Updated State
- `start_year` is now \(\left(\left(\text{start_year} + 1\right) // \text{nums}[1] + 1\right) * \text{nums}[1]\)
- `x` is 1
- `len(nums)` remains the same (the length of the `nums` list)
- `nums` remains the same (a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces)

### Final Answer
State: **`start_year` is \(\left(\left(\text{start_year} + 1\right) // \text{nums}[1] + 1\right) * \text{nums}[1]\), `x` is 1, `len(nums)` is the length of the `nums` list, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces**
