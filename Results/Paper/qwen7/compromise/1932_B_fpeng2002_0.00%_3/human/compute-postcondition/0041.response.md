Output State: `x` is equal to the length of the `nums` list; `start_year` is the result of applying the formula (((((...((start_year + 1) // nums[x-1]) + 1) * nums[x-1]) + 1) // nums[x-2] + 1) * nums[x-2]) + ... + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] to the initial value of `start_year`, which is 0.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `x` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list, and `start_year` will be the final computed value after repeatedly applying the given formula to each element in the `nums` list from the last element to the first element, starting with `start_year` initialized to 0.
