Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in range(0, len(nums))`.

2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop head**: The only variable directly involved in the loop head is `x`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `x` is less than `len(nums)`.

4. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `x` is 0.
   - `start_year` is calculated as `(((start_year + 1) // nums[0]) + 1) * nums[0]`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be 1.
   - The value of `start_year` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop itself but rather by the initial setup or other parts of the code outside the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`x` is 1, `start_year` is (((`start_year` + 1) // `nums[0]`) + 1) * `nums[0]`**.
