Output State: `x` is equal to the length of `nums` - 1; `start_year` is the result of applying the formula (((((...((start_year + 1) // nums[x-2]) + 1) * nums[x-2]) + 1) // nums[x-1] + 1) * nums[x-1]) + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] to the last element of `nums`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `x` will be equal to the total number of elements in the `nums` list minus one, and `start_year` will be the final value obtained by successively applying the given formula to each element of `nums`, starting from `start_year` initialized to 0.
