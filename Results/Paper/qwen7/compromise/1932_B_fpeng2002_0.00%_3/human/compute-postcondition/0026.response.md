Output State: `num_tests` is greater than -1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is updated to `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `x` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list minus one (i.e., `len(nums) - 1`). Therefore, the final update to `start_year` will be based on the last element of the `nums` list, which is `nums[len(nums)-1]`. The expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]` will be applied to `start_year` using the last element of `nums` to compute the final value of `start_year`.
