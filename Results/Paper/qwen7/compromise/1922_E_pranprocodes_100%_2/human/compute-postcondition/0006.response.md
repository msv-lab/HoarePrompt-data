State right before the while loop, the loop condition is `x != 1`. The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one.

- Currently, `x` is an input integer.
- For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must not be equal to 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `x` is not equal to 1.

State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 0, `x` is an input integer but must not be equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list**
