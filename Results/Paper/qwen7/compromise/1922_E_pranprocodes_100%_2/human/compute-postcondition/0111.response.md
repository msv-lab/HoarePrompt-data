Postcondition: `i` is 2, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 and 100000000 or 100000000, and if `x` is even (0 in this case), `x` is divided by 2 resulting in 0, otherwise `x` is -1, `min` is incremented by 1, and `ans` contains -100000000 and `min`.
