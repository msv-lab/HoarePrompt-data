Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing alternating values of 99999997 and -100000000 and is reversed.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `max` from 99999997 to 100000000. All other variables (`i`, `t`, `x`, `min`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
