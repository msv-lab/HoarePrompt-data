Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing -100000000 and min**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(min)` appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Since `min` can be either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` will contain either -100000000 and -100000000 or -100000000 and -99999999. All other variables remain unchanged.
