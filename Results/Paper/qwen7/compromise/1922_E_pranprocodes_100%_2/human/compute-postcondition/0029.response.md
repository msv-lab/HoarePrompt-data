Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 2, `x` is either 50000000 or 99999999, `max` is either 99999997 or 99999998, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is a list containing the values 100000000, 99999999 or -99999999**

Explanation: The value of `max` is decremented by 1. Since `max` could be either 99999998 or 99999999, after decrementing, `max` will be 99999997 or 99999998 respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
