Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 0, `x` is 0, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing `-100000000`.**

The value of `x` is decremented by 1, changing its value from the initial state where it was not equal to 1 (and specifically was 1 more than that) to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
