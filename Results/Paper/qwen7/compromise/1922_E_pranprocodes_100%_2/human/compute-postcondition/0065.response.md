Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 1, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing -100000000 and `min`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Since `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` will now contain either `-100000000, -100000000` or `-100000000, -99999999`. All other variables remain unchanged.
