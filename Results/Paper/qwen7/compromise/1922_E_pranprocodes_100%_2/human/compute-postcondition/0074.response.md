Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 2, `x` is either 0 or 0.25, `max` is either 99999997 or 99999998, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 with 99999998 appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `x = x // 2` divides `x` by 2 using integer division. Since `x` was either 0 or 0.5, after the operation, `x` becomes 0 (since 0.5 // 2 results in 0). All other variables remain unchanged.
