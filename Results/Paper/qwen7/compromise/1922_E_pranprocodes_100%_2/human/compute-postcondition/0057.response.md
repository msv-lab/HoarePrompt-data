Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 0, `x` is not equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing `-100000000`, `x` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1, but since `x` was initially not equal to 1, after decrementing, `x` is now `0`, which is still not equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
