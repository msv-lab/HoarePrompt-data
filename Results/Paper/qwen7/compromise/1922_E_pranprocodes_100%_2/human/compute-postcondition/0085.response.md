Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1. Since `x` is already 1, `t` is 0.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `max` is 99999997.
   - `min` is -100000000.
   - `ans` is a list containing alternating values of 99999997 and -100000000. The list is reversed.

2. **Reversing the List `ans`**:
   - Initially, `ans` would be `[99999997, -100000000, 99999997, -100000000, ...]`.
   - After reversing, `ans` would be `[-100000000, 99999997, -100000000, 99999997, ...]`.

3. **Printing the List**:
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

Given the alternating pattern and the reversal, the printed output will be:
Output: **-100000000 99999997 -100000000 99999997 ...**

However, since the exact length of the list is not specified, we can only describe the pattern. If we assume the list is long enough to show the pattern clearly, the output will follow the described alternating and reversed pattern.
