Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 2, `x` is 1, `max` is either 99999997 or 99999998, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 and 99999998 or 99999999**

Explanation: The code `x = x // 2` divides `x` by 2 using integer division. Given that `x` was initially 0, the result of `x // 2` is still 0. However, since the problem specifies that `x` could be 100000000 or -100000000, and considering the operation `x = x // 2`, `x` would become 50000000 or -50000000 respectively, but since the initial value of `x` is specifically stated as 0, `x` remains 0 after the operation. Therefore, the only change is that `x` is now 1 (half of 2). All other variables remain unchanged.
