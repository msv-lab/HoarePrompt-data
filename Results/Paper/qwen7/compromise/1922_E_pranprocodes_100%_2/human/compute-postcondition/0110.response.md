Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 1, `x` is -1, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -99999999 or -100000000, `ans` is a list containing -100000000 and `min` + 1**

Explanation: The code `x -= 1` subtracts 1 from the current value of `x`. Since `x` was initially 0, after executing the code, `x` becomes -1. All other variables (`i`, `t`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
