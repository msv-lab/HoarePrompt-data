Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000.**

The code initializes the variable `max` to the value 100000000. This assignment does not affect the values of `i`, `t`, or `x`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
