Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -99999999 or -100000000, `ans` is a list containing -100000000 and `min` + 1**

Explanation: The value of `min` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, after adding 1, `min` becomes either -99999999 or -100000000. The `ans` list contains -100000000 and the updated value of `min`.
