Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 and 100000000 or 100000000.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(max)` appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. Since `max` can be either 99999999 or 100000000, `ans` will now contain one of these values plus itself, making it a list with two identical elements.
