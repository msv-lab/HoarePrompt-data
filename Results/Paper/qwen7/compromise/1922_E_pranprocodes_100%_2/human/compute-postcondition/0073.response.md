Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 2, `x` is either 0 or 0.5, `max` is either 99999997 or 99999998, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 with 99999998 appended to it.**

Explanation: The variable `max` is decremented by 1. Since `max` was either 99999998 or 99999999, after decrementing, it becomes either 99999997 or 99999998. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
