Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `ans` as an empty list, which means all elements previously stored in `ans` are removed. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
