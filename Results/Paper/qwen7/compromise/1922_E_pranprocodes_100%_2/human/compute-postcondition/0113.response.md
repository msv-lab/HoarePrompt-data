Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 2, `x` is 0, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 and 100000000 or 100000000, `x` is 0 divided by 2 which results in 0.**

Explanation: The code `t += 1` increments the value of `t` by 1. Given the initial state, `t` was either 1 or 1 (since both conditions are the same), so after executing the code, `t` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
