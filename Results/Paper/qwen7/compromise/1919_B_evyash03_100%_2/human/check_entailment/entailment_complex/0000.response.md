Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Penalty**: The function `func_1` simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and returns it. However, the problem requires splitting the array into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The function does not attempt to split the array into optimal subarrays.

2. **Optimal Splitting Not Implemented**: The function does not consider different ways to split the array to minimize the total penalty. Instead, it just counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and returns a simple difference, which does not necessarily lead to the minimum penalty.

Given these points, the function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
