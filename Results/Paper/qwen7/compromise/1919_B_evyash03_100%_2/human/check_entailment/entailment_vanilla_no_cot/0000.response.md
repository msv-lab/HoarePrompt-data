Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty based on the given problem description. The function `func_1` simply counts the number of '+' characters and calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which does not necessarily lead to the minimum penalty. The solution needs to consider how to optimally split the array to minimize the total penalty. The current implementation does not account for the optimal splitting strategy required by the problem.
