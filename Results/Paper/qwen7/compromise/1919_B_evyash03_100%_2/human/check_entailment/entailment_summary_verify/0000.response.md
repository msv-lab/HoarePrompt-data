Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - We need to split the array \(a\) into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The function should return the minimum possible penalty.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `expression` and an integer `length`.
   - It counts the number of '+' characters in `expression`.
   - It calculates the difference between `length` and this count.
   - It returns the absolute value of the difference between this calculated difference and the count of '+' characters.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` does not actually perform any splitting of the array or calculate the penalty for different splits.
   - Instead, it only counts the number of '+' characters and calculates a simple difference without considering the actual penalty calculation.
   - This approach does not take into account the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input `length = 6` and `expression = "--++--"`.
     - The function `func_1` would count 2 '+' characters and 4 '-' characters.
     - It would calculate the difference as \(4 - 2 = 2\).
     - It would then return \(|2 - 2| = 0\).
   - However, the optimal split would be `([--++], [--])`, resulting in penalties of \(4 + 2 = 6\).

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` does not implement the required logic to find the minimum possible penalty. The original assessment is correct because the program does not handle the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty.

Final: **False**
