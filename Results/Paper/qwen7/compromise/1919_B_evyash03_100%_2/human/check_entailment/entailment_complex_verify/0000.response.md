### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string (`length`) and the string itself (`expression`).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the string `expression` and its length `length`.
   - It counts the number of '+' characters in the string and stores it in `count`.
   - It calculates `sub` as the difference between `length` and `count`.
   - Finally, it returns the absolute value of the difference between `sub` and `count`.

#### Annotations:
- The function `func_1` counts the number of '+' characters in the string.
- It calculates `sub` as the difference between the length of the string and the count of '+' characters.
- It returns the absolute value of the difference between `sub` and `count`.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The function `func_1` does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply counts the number of '+' characters and calculates a penalty based on the difference between the number of '-' and '+' characters.
- This approach does not guarantee the minimum penalty because it does not take into account the structure of the array and how to optimally split it.

#### Example Verification:
Consider the input:
```
length = 6
expression = "--++--"
```
- The function counts 2 '+' characters and 4 '-' characters.
- `count = 2`
- `sub = 6 - 2 = 4`
- The function returns `abs(4 - 2) = 2`.

However, the optimal split would be `([--++], [--])`, which results in a penalty of `4 + 2 = 6`.

This example clearly shows that the function does not compute the minimum possible penalty.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the function `func_1` is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
