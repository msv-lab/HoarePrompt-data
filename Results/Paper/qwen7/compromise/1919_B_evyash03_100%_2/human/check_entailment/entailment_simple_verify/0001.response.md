### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Statement Recap**:
   - Given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of `+` and `-`, convert it to an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
   - The goal is to split `a` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty for a single subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return the minimum possible penalty.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `length` and the string `expression`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(expression, length)`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the string `expression` and its length `length`.
   - It counts the number of `+` characters in `expression` and stores it in `count`.
   - It calculates `sub` as `length - count`.
   - Finally, it returns `abs(sub - count)`.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - The function `func_1` does not actually split the array `a` into subarrays.
   - Instead, it simply returns the absolute difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters.
   - This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

5. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the string `expression = "--+++++++-"`.
   - The function will count 4 `+` and 5 `-` characters, so `count = 4` and `sub = 5 - 4 = 1`.
   - The function returns `abs(1 - 4) = 3`.
   - However, the optimal solution is to split the array into `[-1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, -1]`, resulting in a total penalty of 0.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the optimal splits that minimize the penalty.
   - The function `func_1` does not account for the optimal way to split the array, leading to incorrect results in many cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not implement the logic to find the optimal splits that minimize the penalty.
