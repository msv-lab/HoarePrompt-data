The loop condition is `start != end`. For the loop to execute the first time, `start` must be less than `end`.

Given the current state:
- `start` is 0
- `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1

For the loop to execute the first time, `start` (which is currently 0) must be less than `end`. Therefore, `end` must be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`start` is 0, `end` must be greater than 0**
