Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty. Specifically, the logic for splitting the array into two subsequences `s` and `t` is flawed. The program does not ensure that the penalty is minimized, and it does not handle all edge cases properly.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The expected output is `3`, but the program might not always achieve this. The program's logic for deciding which element to add to `a` or `b` is not optimal and does not guarantee the minimum penalty.

A correct approach would involve sorting the array and then splitting it in a way that minimizes the penalty. Hereâ€™s a more appropriate solution:

```python
def min_penalty(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    s = []
    t = []
    for num in arr:
        if not s or num >= s[-1]:
            s.append(num)
        else:
            t.append(num)
    
    def penalty(subseq):
        return sum(1 for i in range(1, len(subseq)) if subseq[i] > subseq[i-1])
    
    return penalty(s) + penalty(t)

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(min_penalty(n, arr))

func()
```

This solution sorts the array and then splits it into two subsequences such that the penalty is minimized. It ensures that elements are added to `s` or `t` in a way that minimizes the number of increasing pairs in each subsequence.
