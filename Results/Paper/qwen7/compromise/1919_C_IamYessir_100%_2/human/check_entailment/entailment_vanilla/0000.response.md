### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to split the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that the total penalty (number of indices where elements are increasing) is minimized. The penalty function `p(b)` counts the number of indices `i` where `b_i < b_{i+1}`.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code iterates through the input array `lit` and tries to decide whether to add each element to subsequence `a` or `b`.
   - It uses two lists `a` and `b` to store elements.
   - The decision to add an element to `a` or `b` is based on comparing the last elements of `a` and `b` with the current element from `lit`.

3. **Issues in the Code**:
   - **Incorrect Logic for Decision Making**: The logic for deciding which subsequence to add the current element to is flawed. Specifically, the conditions inside the loop do not correctly ensure that the subsequences `a` and `b` are constructed in a way that minimizes the total penalty.
   - **Incorrect Handling of Equal Elements**: When `x == y`, the code always appends the element to `a`. This might not be optimal, as it could lead to unnecessary increases in the penalty.
   - **Potential Overlap**: The code does not ensure that the elements are strictly increasing within `a` and `b`, which is necessary to minimize the penalty.

4. **Optimal Solution**:
   - To achieve the minimum penalty, one should sort the array and then split it into two parts such that the penalty is minimized. The optimal strategy is to take the first half of the sorted array for one subsequence and the second half for the other subsequence.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - Sort the array.
   - Split the sorted array into two halves.
   - Calculate the penalty for each half separately and sum them up.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the logic to achieve the minimum penalty. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
