Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to solve the problem but has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Logic for Splitting the Array**: The logic used to decide whether to append an element to `a` or `b` is flawed. Specifically, the conditions under which elements are appended to `a` or `b` do not ensure that the resulting subsequences `s` and `t` are optimal in terms of minimizing the total penalty.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Conditions**: The conditions for appending elements to `a` or `b` are not correctly formulated. For example, the condition `if x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:` and similar conditions do not necessarily lead to an optimal split.

3. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty calculation part seems to be correct, but it only counts the number of increasing pairs in both subsequences. However, the splitting logic itself is incorrect, leading to potentially incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to use a different strategy. One effective approach is to sort the array and then split it into two parts such that the penalty is minimized. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index+n]))
        index += n
        
        # Sort the array
        sorted_arr = sorted(arr)
        
        # Calculate the penalty
        penalty = 0
        for i in range(n-1):
            if sorted_arr[i] < sorted_arr[i+1]:
                penalty += 1
        
        # The minimum penalty is the number of increasing pairs in the sorted array
        results.append(penalty)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage with the provided test cases
func()
```

This approach sorts the array and calculates the penalty directly from the sorted array, ensuring that the penalty is minimized by the nature of the sorted order.
