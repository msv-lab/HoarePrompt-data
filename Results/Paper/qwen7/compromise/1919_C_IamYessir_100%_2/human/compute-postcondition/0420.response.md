Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is not infinity, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `b` is a list containing the element from list `b` at index `i` (appended to the last element of list `a` if `x == y`), and if `x` is less than the first element of list `b` (`lit[0]`), then `lit[0]` is either an element of list `a` or greater than or equal to `y` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[0]` and `lit[0]` is greater than `x`.
