Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `x` is not infinity; `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`; `b` is not an empty list; the list `a` has its last element appended with the element at index `i` of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `lit` (which is the same as `b` given the context) to list `a`. Since `i` is 0, it appends the first element of `b` to `a`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
