Output State: **`i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list containing the element `lit[3]`; `b` is either empty or contains its original elements; `x` is the last element of `a` which is `lit[3]`; `y` is either infinity (if `b` is empty) or the last element of `b` (if `b` is not empty)**.

This means that the list `a` now contains one additional element, which is `lit[3]`, while the state of `b` remains unchanged. The value of `x` is updated to be the last element of `a`, which is `lit[3]`. The value of `y` remains as per the condition of the list `b`.
