Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, and `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is equal to the last element of list `a`. If `x` (which is the last element of `a`) is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `a` has an additional element `lit[0]`. Otherwise, `b` is a list that now contains the element `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, or `b` remains unchanged if no such `i` satisfies the condition.
