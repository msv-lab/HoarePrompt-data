Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element and may have one more element added, `x` is either the last element of list `a` or `float('inf')`, `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `y = b[-1]` assigns the value of the last element of list `b` to variable `y`. No other variables are affected. The conditions for `x` and `y` remain unchanged as the code does not interact with `a` or `i` or `n`.
