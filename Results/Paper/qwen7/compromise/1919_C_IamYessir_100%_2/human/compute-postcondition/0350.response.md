Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(b)` + 1, `b` is a list with at least one element, `s` is the count of elements in list `b` where each element is greater than its preceding element, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `lit`. The values of `i`, `b`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
