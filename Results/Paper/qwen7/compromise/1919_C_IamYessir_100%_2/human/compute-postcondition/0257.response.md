Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is equal to the last element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of list `a` to the variable `x`. Since `y` was previously equal to the last element of list `a`, `y` remains unchanged. All other variables (`i`, `n`, and `a`) remain in their initial states.
