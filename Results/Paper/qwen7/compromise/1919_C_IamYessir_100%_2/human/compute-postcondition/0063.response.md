Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being positive infinity, or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of list `b`. The condition `x >= lit[i]` is true, and the current value of `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.
