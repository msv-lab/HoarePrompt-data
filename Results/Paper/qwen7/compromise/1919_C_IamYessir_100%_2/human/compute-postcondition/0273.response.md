Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element and now has one more element which is `a[-1]` (the previous last element), `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is the last element of list `a`, if `b` is an empty list, then `y` is set to infinity, otherwise `y` is set to the last element of list `b`**.

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` was initially 1, after executing the code, `i` becomes 2 (since list indices start from 0). The list `a` gains a new element, which is `lit[1]`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged unless `b` is an empty list, in which case `y` would be set to infinity.
