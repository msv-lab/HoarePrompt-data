Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is the last element of list `a`. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is set to infinity. If `b` is not empty, `y` is set to the last element of list `b`. Additionally, if `i` is 1, `a` gains one more element which is `a[-1]` (the previous last element). If `i` is 2, `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is greater than `x` and greater than or equal to `y`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged.
