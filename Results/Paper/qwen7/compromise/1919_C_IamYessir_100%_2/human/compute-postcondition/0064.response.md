Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being positive infinity, or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of list `b`, and list `b` now includes the value `lit[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Since `i` is 0, the value appended to `b` is `lit[0]`. The other variables (`a`, `x`, `y`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
