Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list with the last element being `x`; `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of list `b`; the condition `x` is equal to `y`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 0, `lit[0]` is appended to `a`. Since `a` was initially either an empty list with `x` being positive infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, after appending `lit[0]`, `a` will now have one more element. The value of `x` will now be equal to `lit[0]` (or the last element of the updated list `a`). The conditions and values of `n`, `y`, and the condition `x` is equal to `y` remain unchanged.
