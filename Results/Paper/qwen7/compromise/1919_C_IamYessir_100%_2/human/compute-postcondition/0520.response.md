Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n and a list of n integers. For each test case, it populates two lists, `a` and `b`, based on specific comparison conditions against the input list `lit`. It then counts the number of increasing pairs in list `b` and prints this count. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
