Postcondition: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element and may have one more element added, `x` is the last element of list `a` or `float('inf')`, and `y` is the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty; otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`. If `x` equals `y`, `a` remains unchanged. If `x` does not equal `y`, `a` gets an additional element `lit[i]` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`, while `y` remains unchanged.**
