Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, `b` is a list containing elements from list `b` at index `i` (which is now 1), and `b` has appended `lit[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. Given that `i` was initially 1, `b` now contains the element `lit[1]` in addition to its previous elements. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 because list indices start from 0, so after appending, `i` becomes 2. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
