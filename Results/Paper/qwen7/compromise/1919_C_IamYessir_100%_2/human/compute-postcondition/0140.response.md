Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `y` remains unchanged and `b` is a list with its last element being `a[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `y` is set to `lit[i]` and `b` is a list with its last element being `a[i]`.
