Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, and now `a` has an additional element which is `lit[i]`, and `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is equal to the last element of list `a`, and `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than `lit[0]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, and `x` is the last element of list `a` (which was previously equal to `y`), `x` remains less than `y` after the append operation. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
