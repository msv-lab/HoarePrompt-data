Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`; `a` is a list with its last element being `a[3]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 3, `lit[i]` is `lit[3]`, which becomes the last element of list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
