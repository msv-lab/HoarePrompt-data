Output State: **`i` is `len(b)`, `s` is the total count of times `b[i]` was found to be greater than `b[i - 1]` over all iterations, `n` is an input integer, and `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `lit`. The values of `i`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
