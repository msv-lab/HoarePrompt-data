Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list containing elements that satisfy the conditions defined within the loop, `x` is the last element of list `a` or `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, and `y` is the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty; otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`. The lists `a` and `b` will contain elements from the input list `lit` based on the comparison rules specified in the loop body.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has processed each element in the input list `lit`. The lists `a` and `b` will contain elements from `lit` that were appended based on the conditions inside the loop. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the last elements of `a` and `b` respectively, or `float('inf')` if their respective lists are empty.
