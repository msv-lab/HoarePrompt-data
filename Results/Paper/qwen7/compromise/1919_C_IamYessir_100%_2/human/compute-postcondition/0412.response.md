Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is not infinity, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `b` is a list containing the element `lit[0]`, the current value of `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than `lit[0]`, and `lit[0]` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[0]` and `lit[0]` is greater than `x`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[0]` and `lit[0]` is greater than `x` if `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes, ensuring that all conditions from both the if and else parts are covered.
