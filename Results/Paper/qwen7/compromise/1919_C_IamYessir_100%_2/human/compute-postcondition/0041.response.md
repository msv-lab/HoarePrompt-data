Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the element `lit[i]` with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of list `b`. The current value of `y` is greater than the current value of `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x`, otherwise `y` is less than or equal to `lit[i]` and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.
