Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is equal to the last element of list `a`, `x` is infinity (float('inf'))**.

The code sets `x` to infinity (`float('inf')`). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
