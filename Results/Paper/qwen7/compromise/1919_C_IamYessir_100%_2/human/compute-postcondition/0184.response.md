Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n`. These are the only variables that can be adjusted.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently set to `len(b)`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(0, n)` will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `len(b)`, and the loop will start with `i = 0` (as per the range function), `i` must be adjusted to `0` for the loop to start executing.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `0` for the loop to execute, but since `n` is an input integer, we assume it is valid and non-negative.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0**
