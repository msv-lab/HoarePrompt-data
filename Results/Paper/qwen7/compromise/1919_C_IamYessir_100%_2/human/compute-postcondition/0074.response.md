Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being positive infinity, or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `x` is equal to `y`, then `a` and `y` remain unchanged. If `x` is not equal to `y`, then `a` remains unchanged and `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] < x` and `lit[i] > y`.
