Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the element `lit[0]` with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of list `b`. The current value of `y` is less than or equal to the current value of `lit[i]`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `y`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is initially 0, `a.append(lit[i])` appends `lit[0]` to `a`. The other conditions remain unchanged as no other variables are modified.
