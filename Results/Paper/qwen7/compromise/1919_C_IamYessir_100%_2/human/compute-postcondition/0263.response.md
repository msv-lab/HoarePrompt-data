Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is the last element of list `a`, `b` is a list with one more element than before, which is `a[i]` (i.e., `a[1]`)**.

Explanation: The code `b.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `a` to list `b`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `a[i]` refers to the second element of list `a`. This element is appended to list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` increments to 2 (since we accessed `a[i]` where `i` was 1), and `b` gains a new element, which is `a[1]`.
