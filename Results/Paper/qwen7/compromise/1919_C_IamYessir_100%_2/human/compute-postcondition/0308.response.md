Postcondition: `i` is 2 or 3, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element and now has one more element which is `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of list `a` or `float('inf')`, and `y` is the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty; otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `a` has one more element which is `lit[i]`, `x` is updated to `lit[i]`, and `y` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged.
