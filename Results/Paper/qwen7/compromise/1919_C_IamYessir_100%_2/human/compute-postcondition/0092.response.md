Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `i` remains 2, `n` remains greater than 0, `x` remains either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` remains either infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `lit[i]` is not greater than `x`, then `i` is set to 2, and if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `i` remains 2, `n` remains greater than 0, `x` remains either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`.
