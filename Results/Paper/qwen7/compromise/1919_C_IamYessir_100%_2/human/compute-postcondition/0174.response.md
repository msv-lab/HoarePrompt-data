Output State: **`i` is `len(b)`, `s` is 3 if `b[len(b) - 1]` is greater than `b[len(b) - 2]`, otherwise `s` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is `len(b)`. The value of `s` is incremented by 1, so if `b[len(b) - 1]` was greater than `b[len(b) - 2]` (making `s` initially 2), now `s` becomes 3. If `b[len(b) - 1]` was not greater than `b[len(b) - 2]` (keeping `s` initially 1), now `s` becomes 2.
