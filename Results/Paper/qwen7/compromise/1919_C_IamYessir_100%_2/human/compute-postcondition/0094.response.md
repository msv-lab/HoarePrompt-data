Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `i` remains 2, `n` remains greater than 0, `x` remains either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` remains either infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, then `y` is updated to `lit[i]`.
