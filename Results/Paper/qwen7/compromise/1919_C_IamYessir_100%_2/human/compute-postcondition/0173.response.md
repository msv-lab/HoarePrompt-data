Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is the length of `b`.
   - `s` is 2 if `b[len(b) - 1]` is greater than `b[len(b) - 2]`, otherwise `s` remains 1.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, len(b)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `len(b)`.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `len(b)` (the current value of `i` plus 1).

5. **Postconditions:**
   - The postcondition given is that `i` is the length of `b` and `s` is 2 if `b[len(b) - 1]` is greater than `b[len(b) - 2]`, otherwise `s` remains 1.
   - Since the loop will continue as long as `i < len(b)`, the condition for the next iteration is that `i` must be `len(b)`.

6. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` must be `len(b)`.
   - The value of `s` remains unchanged unless the condition `b[len(b) - 1] > b[len(b) - 2]` changes, but since we are only adjusting the state for the loop to execute one more time, we assume `s` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is `len(b)`, `s` is 2 if `b[len(b) - 1]` is greater than `b[len(b) - 2]`, otherwise `s` remains 1.**
