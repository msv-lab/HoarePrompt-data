Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, `b` is a list with its last element being `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i]` to list `b`. Given that `i` is 3, `b` now has its last element as `a[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
