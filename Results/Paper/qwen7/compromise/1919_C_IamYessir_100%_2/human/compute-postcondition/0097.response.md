Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`; `a` is a list with its last element being the value of `lit[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is initially 1, after executing the code, `i` will be incremented to 2 (assuming `i` is incremented afterward or managed within a loop context). The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. The values of `x` and `y` also remain unchanged as they are not involved in this operation. The list `a` now contains its previous elements plus the value of `lit[1]`.
