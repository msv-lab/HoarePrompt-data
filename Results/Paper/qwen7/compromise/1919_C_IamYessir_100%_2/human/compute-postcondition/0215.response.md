Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is equal to the last element of list `a`, and after the execution of the if-else block, `lit[i]` is appended to list `a` and becomes the new last element of `a`, with the condition that `x` is greater than or equal to `y` is still satisfied.
