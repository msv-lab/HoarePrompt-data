Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element and now has one more element which is `a[-1]` (the previous last element), `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is the last element of list `a`, if `b` is an empty list, then `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` from the list `lit` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 1, the element at index 1 of `lit` is appended to `a`. Since `a` originally had at least one element, after appending, `a` now has one more element. The value of `x` remains the last element of `a` before the append operation, and `y` also remains the last element of `a` because no changes were made to `b` or `y` in the given code snippet.
