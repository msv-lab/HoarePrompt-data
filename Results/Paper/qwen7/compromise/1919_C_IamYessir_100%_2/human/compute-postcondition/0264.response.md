Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is the last element of list `a`, `b` is a list with one more element than before, which is `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `a` to list `b`. Given that `i` was initially 1, `a[i]` refers to the second element of list `a`. After appending, `i` increments by 1 (since `i += 1` is implied by the next logical step in sequence), making `i` equal to 2. The value of `n`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
