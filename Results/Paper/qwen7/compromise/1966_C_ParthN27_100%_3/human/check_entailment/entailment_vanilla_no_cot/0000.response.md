Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the game logic. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Set Usage**: The code uses a set to eliminate duplicate values in the array `arr`. However, this approach doesn't align with the game rules, which involve removing the same number of stones from each non-empty pile simultaneously.

2. **Logic for Determining Winner**: The logic to determine the winner is flawed. The current implementation checks the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted unique list but does not correctly simulate the game moves.

3. **Game Logic**: The game involves reducing all piles by the same amount up to the size of the smallest non-empty pile. The solution should simulate these moves and determine the winner based on the parity of the Nim-sum (XOR of the sizes of the piles after each move).

To correctly solve this problem, you need to use the concept of the Nim-game strategy. Specifically, you should compute the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes) and determine the winner based on whether this sum is zero or not. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Compute the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes)
        nim_sum = 0
        for pile in arr:
            nim_sum ^= pile
        
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This solution correctly computes the Nim-sum and determines the winner based on the parity of the Nim-sum, which aligns with the optimal strategy for the Nim-game.
