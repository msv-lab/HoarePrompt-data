Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and is incremented by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will become 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still satisfy the condition `i < n`. Given that `i` becomes 1, `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` contains `arr[0]`**
