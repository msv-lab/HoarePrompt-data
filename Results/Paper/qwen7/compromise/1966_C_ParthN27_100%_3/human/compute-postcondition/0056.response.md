Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `s` contains `arr[0]`**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[0]` (since `i` is 0) to the set `s`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 0, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1, and `s` now contains the element `arr[0]`.
