Output State: `i` is less than `n`; `s` is a set containing all elements from the list `arr`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached `n`, but since the loop condition checks if `i` is less than `n`, it will stop executing once `i` equals `n`. The set `s` will contain every element from the list `arr` because each element is added to the set `s` in each iteration of the loop.
