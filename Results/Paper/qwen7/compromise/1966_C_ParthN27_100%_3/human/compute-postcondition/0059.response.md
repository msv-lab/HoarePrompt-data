Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Determine the Next Values**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n`, `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 2.

5. **Consider Other Variables**:
   - The variable `s` contains `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`. This variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Based on this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
