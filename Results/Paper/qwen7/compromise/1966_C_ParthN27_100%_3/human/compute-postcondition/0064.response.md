Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `n`, the list `s` is sorted version of the set containing all elements from the list `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `s.sort()` sorts the list `s` in ascending order. Since the initial state mentions that `s` is a list converted from a set containing all elements from the list `arr`, the output state indicates that `s` now contains these elements sorted. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation.
