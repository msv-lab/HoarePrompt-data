Output State: `i` is within the range `[n-2, n-2]`, `n` is at least 3, `s` is a sorted list containing all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, and the first element of `s` is 0; if `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` for any `i` in its final range, then `ans` is 0, otherwise `ans` remains 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will reach `n-2`. The loop breaks if it finds any pair of consecutive elements in the list `s` where the difference is greater than 1. Since the loop only increments `i` and checks the condition without changing `i` when the condition is false, `i` will eventually reach `n-2`. If the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` was never met throughout the loop's execution, `ans` remains 0. If the condition was met at any point, `ans` would have been set to 1 but would be reset to 0 in the next iteration, resulting in `ans` being 0 at the end.
