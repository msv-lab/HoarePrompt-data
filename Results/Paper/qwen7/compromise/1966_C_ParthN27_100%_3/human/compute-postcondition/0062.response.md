Output State: `i` is equal to `n`; `n` must be greater than or equal to `n`; the set `s` contains all elements from the list `arr`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The condition `n` must be greater than or equal to `n` (which is always true) ensures the loop ran completely. The set `s` will contain every element from the list `arr` because each element was added to the set `s` in each iteration of the loop.
