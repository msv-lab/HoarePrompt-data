Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, so `i` should be incremented by `1` each iteration.
3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `s` and `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.
4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by `1` at the end of each iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` must still be greater than `i + 1` (which is now `i + 2`) for the loop to continue.

Given these points, let's update the states accordingly:

- `i` will be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
- `n` must be greater than `i + 2` (since `i` will be `i + 1`).

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: `s` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `s` and `i` is `i + 2`, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.**
