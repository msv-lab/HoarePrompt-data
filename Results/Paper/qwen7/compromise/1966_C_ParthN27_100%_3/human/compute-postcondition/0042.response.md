Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of list `s`, and `n` is not equal to 2. The variable `ans` is 0, as the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` was met at least once for some `i` in the range from 1 to `n-2`. The variable `i` remains equal to `n`, and `n` remains the length of list `s` and is not equal to 2.
