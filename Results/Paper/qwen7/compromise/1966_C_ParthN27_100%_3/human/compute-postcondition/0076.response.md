Output State: **`s` is a sequence of integers, where the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i-1]` is less than or equal to 1; `ans` is `ans` XOR 1.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is XORed with 1. This operation toggles the value of `ans` between 0 and 1. Since the initial value of `ans` is not specified, we only know that it has been modified by the XOR operation. The sequence `s` remains unchanged as the code snippet does not affect any elements of `s`.
