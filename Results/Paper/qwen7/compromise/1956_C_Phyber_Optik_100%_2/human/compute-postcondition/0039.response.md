Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State:
   - `j` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 5 but no explicit value is given.
   - `sum` is explicitly given as 9240 (though it's not used in the print statement).

2. The print statement is:
   ```python
   print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. Breaking down the print statement:
   - `2`: This is a constant value.
   - `n - j + 1`: Since `j` is 1, this simplifies to `n - 1 + 1` which is just `n`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into individual numbers from 1 to `n`.

4. Given `j = 1` and `n >= 5`, the print statement will output:
   - `2`
   - `n` (which is at least 5)
   - All integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive)

Since `n` is at least 5, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` to illustrate the output clearly:
- If `n = 5`, the output would be `2 5 1 2 3 4 5`.

However, since `n` could be any value greater than or equal to 5, the output will include `2`, `n`, and the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **2 n 1 2 3 ... (n-1) n** (where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 5)
