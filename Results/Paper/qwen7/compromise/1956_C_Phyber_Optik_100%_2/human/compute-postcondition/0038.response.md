Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `j` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 5 but its exact value is not specified.
   - `sum` is explicitly given as 9240 (though it's not used in the print statement).

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))`.

3. **Breaking Down the Print Statement**:
   - `1`: This is directly printed as 1.
   - `n - j + 1`: Since `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `n - j + 1` simplifies to `n - 1 + 1` which is simply `n`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range from 1 to `n + 1`. Given that `n` is at least 5, the range will include numbers from 1 up to `n`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The print statement will output `1`, followed by `n` (which is at least 5), and then a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Given the above steps, the output will be:

Output: **1 n 1 2 3 4 ... n (where n is a number greater than or equal to 5)**
