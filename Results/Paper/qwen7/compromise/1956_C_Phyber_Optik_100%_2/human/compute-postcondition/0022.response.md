Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State: `j` is 3, and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3.
2. The code snippet is: `print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))`.

Let's break down the print statement:

- `2`: This is a constant value.
- `n - j + 1`: Given `j = 3`, this expression simplifies to `n - 3 + 1` or `n - 2`.
- `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into individual arguments. The range from 1 to `n + 1` will be printed as separate numbers.

Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, let's consider the smallest possible value for `n` to get a concrete example:

- If `n = 3`, then `n - 2 = 1`.
- The range `1, 2, 3` will be unpacked and printed as `1 2 3`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **2 1 1 2 3**
