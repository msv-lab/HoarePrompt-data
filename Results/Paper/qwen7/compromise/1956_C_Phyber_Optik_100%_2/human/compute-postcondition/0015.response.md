Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is explicitly defined as 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Breakdown of the Print Statement**:
   - `1`: This is directly printed as 1.
   - `n - j + 1`: Since `j` is 1, this simplifies to `n - 1 + 1`, which is just `n`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into individual arguments and prints them. The range `range(1, n + 1)` generates numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

4. **Combining the Parts**:
   - The print statement will output three parts separated by spaces: `1`, `n`, and the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Given the initial state and the breakdown, the output will be:

Output: **1 n 1 2 ... n** (where `n` is a positive integer greater than 0)
