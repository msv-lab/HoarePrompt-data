Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `sum` is explicitly given as 9240 (though it is not used in the print statement).

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement to be executed is `print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))`.

3. **Breaking Down the Print Statement**:
   - `2`: This is directly printed as 2.
   - `n - j + 1`: Given `j` is 2, this expression simplifies to `n - 2 + 1` or `n - 1`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range from 1 to `n` into individual arguments to be printed.

4. **Final Output**:
   - Since `n` is greater than or equal to 5, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` which is 5 (the minimum value satisfying the condition).
     - If `n = 5`, then `n - 1 = 4`.
     - The range `range(1, n + 1)` becomes `range(1, 6)`, which expands to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2 4 1 2 3 4 5**
