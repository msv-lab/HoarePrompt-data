Output State: **`j` is `n+1`, `n` is an input integer, `sum` is 9240**

Explanation: The variable `n` is reassigned to the integer value entered by the user using `int(input())`. The value of `j` remains as `n+1` from the initial state because no operation was performed on `j` within the given code snippet. The value of `sum` remains unchanged at 9240.
