Output State: The loop will have executed for all values of `j` from 1 to `n`, printing the sequence `1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1)` and then `2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1)` for each `j`. Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is a series of printed lines where the first element is 1 or 2, the second element is `n - j + 1` for decreasing values of `j` from `n` to 1, followed by the range of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, printed twice per line for each `j`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop will print `n` lines for each value of `j` from 1 to `n`. Each line will start with either 1 or 2, followed by `n - j + 1`, and then the numbers from 1 to `n` listed twice.
