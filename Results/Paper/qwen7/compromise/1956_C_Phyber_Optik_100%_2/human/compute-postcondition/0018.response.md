Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Breakdown of the Print Statement**:
   - `1`: This is directly printed as 1.
   - `n - j + 1`: Since `j` is 2, this expression simplifies to `n - 2 + 1` or `n - 1`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into individual elements. The range from 1 to `n + 1` will include all integers from 1 up to `n`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The print statement will output three parts separated by spaces:
     1. The number 1.
     2. The value of `n - 1`.
     3. All integers from 1 to `n` in sequence.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be:
Output: **1, n-1, 1 2 ... n** (where `n` is a positive integer greater than 0).
