Output State: The final value of `sum` is calculated as the sum of \((i \times i - (i-1) \times (i-1)) \times i\) for each \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

To understand this, let's break down the expression inside the loop:

\[
(i \times i - (i-1) \times (i-1)) \times i = (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i = (i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1)) \times i = (2i - 1) \times i = 2i^2 - i
\]

So, the loop updates `sum` by adding \(2i^2 - i\) for each \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). Therefore, the final value of `sum` is the sum of \(2i^2 - i\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

In simpler terms, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the sum of the series \(2i^2 - i\) for \(i\) ranging from 2 to \(n\).
