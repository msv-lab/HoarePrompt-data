Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for i in range(2, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `sum` is 28
   - `j` is `n+1`
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 2 up to `n` (inclusive).

4. **Analyze the current state of `i` and `n`**:
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

5. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same as the previous iteration.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `sum` remains 28.
   - `j` remains `n+1`.
   - `i` changes to 4.
   - `n` remains greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`sum` is 28, `j` is `n+1`, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
