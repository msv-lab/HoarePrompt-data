Output State: `j` is `n+1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `sum` is 9240.

Explanation: Based on the given loop, the variable `j` increments from 1 to `n` in each iteration. Since the loop continues until `j` reaches `n+1`, after all iterations, `j` will be `n+1`. The value of `sum` remains unchanged at 9240 because the loop does not modify the `sum` variable; it only prints the current state of `j` and `n`. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `j` will be `n+1`, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 5, and `sum` will remain 9240.
