Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, sum is 2 * (2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2 = 6.**

Explanation: The code updates the `sum` variable by adding the value of `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`. Given that `i` is initially 2, the expression evaluates to `(2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2 = (4 - 1) * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6`. So, `sum` is updated to 6. After this operation, `i` is incremented to 3, and the condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 remains unchanged.
