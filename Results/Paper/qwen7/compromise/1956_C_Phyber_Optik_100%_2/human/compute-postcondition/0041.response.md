Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.
   - `sum` is 9240.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The first argument to `print` is `1`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 2, this becomes `n - 2 + 1` or `n - 1`.
   - The third argument uses `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range object into individual arguments starting from 1 up to `n`.

4. **Determine the Value of `n`:**
   - Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 5 and no specific value is provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `n` from the given information. However, the output will depend on this value.

5. **Construct the Output:**
   - The output will be a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`, with the first two numbers being `1` and `n - 1`.

Given the above analysis, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`, with the first two numbers being `1` and `n - 1`.

Output: **1, n - 1, 1, 2, ..., n - 1, n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 5)**
