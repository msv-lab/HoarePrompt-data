Output State: **`sum` is 28, `j` is `n+1`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sum` by adding the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to its current value. Given `i` is 3, the expression simplifies to `(3 * 3 - (3 - 1) * (3 - 1)) * 3 = (9 - 4) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15`. So, `sum` becomes `7 + 15 = 28`. The values of `j`, `i`, and the condition on `n` remain unchanged.
