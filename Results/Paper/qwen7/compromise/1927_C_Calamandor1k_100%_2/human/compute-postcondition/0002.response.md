Output State: `results` is a list that contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, for each test case (n, m, k, a, b):

- If more than half of the elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` are not in `b`, append 'NO'.
- If more than half of the elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` are not in `a`, append 'NO'.
- If the total number of distinct elements in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k` is less than `k`, append 'NO'.
- Otherwise, append 'YES'.
