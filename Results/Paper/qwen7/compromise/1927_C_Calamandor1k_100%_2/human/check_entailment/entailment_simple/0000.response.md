Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if we can select exactly \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements from each of two arrays such that all integers from 1 to \( k \) are included among the chosen elements.
2. **Key Logic**:
   - We need to ensure that there are enough unique elements in both arrays to cover all integers from 1 to \( k \).
   - Specifically, we need to check if there are enough unique elements in each array and their intersection to satisfy the condition.
3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly converts the input into sets (`unique_a` and `unique_b`) to handle unique elements.
   - It then filters these sets to include only elements within the range [1, k].
   - It calculates the number of unique elements in each array and their intersection.
   - The logic checks if the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds \( \frac{k}{2} \) or if the total count of distinct elements is less than \( k \).
   - If any of these conditions fail, it appends 'NO' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'YES'.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge cases where the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` might exceed \( \frac{k}{2} \) or where the total count of distinct elements is insufficient.
   - The logic is sound and covers all necessary conditions.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
