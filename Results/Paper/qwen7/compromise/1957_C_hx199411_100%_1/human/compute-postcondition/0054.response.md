Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `num` is either `k` or `2 * k`, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are input integers, `m` is `n - num`**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state values of `t`, `num`, `i`, `c`, `r`, and `m` remain unchanged. `num` is still either `k` or `2 * k`, and `m` is updated to `n - num`.
