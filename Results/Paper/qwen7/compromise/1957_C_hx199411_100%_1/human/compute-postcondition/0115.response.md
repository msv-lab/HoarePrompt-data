Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `c` is an input integer from the second input, `r` is an input integer from the second input, and `num` is 3.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is incremented by 1, so if `c` was equal to `r`, `num` is now 3 (since it was initially 2), and if `c` was not equal to `r`, `num` is also now 3 (since it was initially 2). All other variables remain unchanged.
