Output State: The value of `dp[i]` will be updated according to the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` for each `i` from 3 to `m` (inclusive). After all iterations, `dp` will be a list where each element `dp[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `m`) is computed based on the previous two elements in the list, following the given recurrence relation, and all calculations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The other variables such as `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, `c`, `r`, and `m` will retain their initial values, and `m` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2` after all iterations.
