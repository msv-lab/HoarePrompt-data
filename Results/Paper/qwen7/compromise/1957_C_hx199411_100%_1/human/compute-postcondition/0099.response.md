Postcondition: **`m` is `n - num`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `num` is the total sum of 1 added when `c` equals `r` and 2 added when `c` does not equal `r` for all iterations, `i` is `k + (k - 1)`, `c` and `r` are integers from the input, and `i` is greater than `k`. If `m` equals 1, then `m` remains 1. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements where each element is calculated according to the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` for `i` ranging from 3 to `m + 1`, with the initial conditions `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. All other variables such as `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged from their respective values after the third iteration.**
