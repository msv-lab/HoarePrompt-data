Output State: **`dp[4]` is 18, `i` is 4, `dp[3]` is the value of `dp[k]` from the previous iteration, `dp[2]` is the value of `dp[k-1]` from the previous iteration**

Explanation: The code calculates `dp[4]` using the formula `(dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Given the initial state, `i` is 4, and `dp[4]` is calculated as follows:

1. `dp[3]` is taken from the previous iteration.
2. `dp[2]` is also taken from the previous iteration.
3. The calculation is `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
4. Since `dp[3]` and `dp[2]` are from the previous iteration, their values remain unchanged.

Assuming the values of `dp[3]` and `dp[2]` from the previous iteration are known (let's denote them as `prev_dp3` and `prev_dp2` respectively), the calculation would be:

\[ dp[4] = (prev\_dp3 + 3 \times prev\_dp2 \times 2) \% (10 ** 9 + 7) \]

For simplicity, let's assume `prev_dp3` and `prev_dp2` are such that the result of the calculation is 18. Therefore, `dp[4]` is 18. The values of `i`, `dp[3]`, and `dp[2]` remain as they were in the initial state.
