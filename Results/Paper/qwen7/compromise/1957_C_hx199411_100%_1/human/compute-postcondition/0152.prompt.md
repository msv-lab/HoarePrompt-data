Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, for each test case, r_i and c_i are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    num = 0
    for i in range(k):
        c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if c == r:
            num += 1
        else:
            num += 2
    m = n - num
    if m == 0:
        print(1)
    elif m == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] = 3
        for i in range(3, m + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
        print(dp[m])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t - 2 * k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either `k` or `2 * k`, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are input integers, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, the function does nothing. If `m` is 1, `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with the first two elements fixed as `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, and the rest of the elements filled according to the loop's computation rule, ensuring no overflow by taking modulo `10^9 + 7`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `m` is 0 or 1, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `num` is the total sum of 1 added when `c` equals `r` and 2 added when `c` does not equal `r` for all iterations, `i` is `k + (k - 1)`, `c` and `r` are integers from the input, and `i` is greater than `k`. If `m` equals 0, then `dp` is undefined. If `m` equals 1, then `m` remains 1. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements where each element is calculated according to the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `k-1` or `k-2`, `c` is an input integer from one of the inputs, `r` is an input integer from the same input as `c`, `num` is the final value calculated based on all the comparisons made during the loop, which is `2*k + (k - 1)` if all `c` equals `r` or `2*k + 2*(k - 1)` if any `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num`, and `dp[i]` holds the final computed value based on the loop's formula, modulo \(10^9 + 7\) if `m` is less than 3.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
