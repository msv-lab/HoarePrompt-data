Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is 1, `i` is 0, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and `c` is equal to `r`.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
