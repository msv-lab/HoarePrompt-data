Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `num` is `num + 1`, `i` is `k`, `c` and `r` are integers from the input, `m` is `n - num`, `c` and `r` are assigned values from the input.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `num` now becomes `num + 1`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, `r`, `m`) retain their original values as no changes were made to them by the provided code.
