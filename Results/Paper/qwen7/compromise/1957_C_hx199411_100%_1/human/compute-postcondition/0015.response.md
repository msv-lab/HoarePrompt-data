Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either 4 or 6 depending on whether `c` is equal to `r` or not, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are input integers.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 2. Since `num` was either 1 or 2 depending on whether `c` is equal to `r`, after adding 2, `num` will now be either 3 (if it was originally 1) or 4 (if it was originally 2). If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` will be 4; otherwise, it will be 6. All other variables remain unchanged.
