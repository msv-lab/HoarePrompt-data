Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `num`:**
   - The variable `num` is supposed to count the number of unique positions where either a white or black rook has been placed. However, the current logic incorrectly increments `num` by 2 for non-diagonal placements and 1 for diagonal placements. This is incorrect because for non-diagonal placements, only one unique position is added, not two.

2. **Dynamic Programming Logic:**
   - The dynamic programming approach used to calculate the number of configurations is flawed. The logic for updating the DP table is incorrect and does not accurately reflect the problem's constraints.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation should be applied correctly to avoid overflow and ensure the result is within the required bounds. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

### Corrected Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        num = 0
        for i in range(k):
            (c, r) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 1  # Only one unique position is added for non-diagonal placements

        m = n - num
        if m <= 0:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [0] * (m + 1)
            dp[0] = 1
            dp[1] = 1
            for i in range(2, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % MOD
            print(dp[m])

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
- **Counting Unique Positions (`num`):** 
  - For each move, if the rook is placed diagonally, increment `num` by 1. For non-diagonal placements, also increment `num` by 1.

- **Dynamic Programming Table (`dp`):**
  - Initialize `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in `i` empty positions.
  - Base cases: `dp[0] = 1` (no rooks to place) and `dp[1] = 1` (one rook in one position).
  - For each subsequent position, update `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % MOD`.

This corrected solution should now accurately compute the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
