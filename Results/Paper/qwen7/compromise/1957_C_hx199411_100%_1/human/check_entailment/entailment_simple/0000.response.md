Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by `k` pairs of coordinates `(r_i, c_i)`.

2. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `num` and `m` are initialized correctly to keep track of the number of mirrored and non-mirrored moves, and the remaining positions, respectively.

3. **Mirrored Moves Counting**: The logic for counting mirrored and non-mirrored moves is correct. When `c == r`, `num` is incremented by 1, and when `c != r`, `num` is incremented by 2.

4. **Remaining Positions Calculation**: The calculation of `m` as `n - num` is correct, representing the number of remaining positions on the board that can still be used to place rooks without violating the rules.

5. **Dynamic Programming Initialization and Update**: The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized correctly with base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is applied correctly for `i` from 3 to `m`.

6. **Output**: The final output is computed correctly using the dynamic programming approach, and the result is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given that the annotated program accurately reflects the logic described in the problem statement and the provided example, and that all steps are correctly implemented, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
