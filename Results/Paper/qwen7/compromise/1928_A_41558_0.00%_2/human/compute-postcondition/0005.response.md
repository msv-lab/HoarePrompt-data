Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each pair, it checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd and not equal, and if \(a/2\) does not equal \(b\) and \(b/2\) does not equal \(a\). If these conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the given pairs.**
