### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Sorting:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, then parses the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It sorts the array `b` in ascending order, which is a good start for the next steps.

2. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a max heap to keep track of the largest differences between elements of `a` and `b`.
   - For each element in `a`, it calculates the absolute differences with the smallest and largest elements in `b` (`b[0]` and `b[m-1]`).
   - Depending on which difference is larger, it pushes the appropriate tuple into the heap. This ensures that the heap always contains the largest possible differences.

3. **Heap Processing:**
   - The program processes the heap to maximize the total difference `D`.
   - It maintains pointers `tp1` and `tp2` to track the current positions in `b` that are being used.
   - For each element in the heap, it checks if the corresponding position in `b` is still within the range `[tp1, tp2]`.
   - If the position is out of range, it recalculates the difference using the closest available elements in `b` and updates the pointers accordingly.
   - If the position is within the range, it directly adds the difference to the answer and updates the pointers.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the pointers might go out of bounds by adjusting them appropriately.
   - It ensures that the total difference is maximized by always choosing the largest possible differences.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements in the heap, the program prints the total difference `ans`.

### Conclusion:

The program logic appears to be correct and follows the requirements of the problem. It correctly calculates the maximum total difference `D` by leveraging a max heap to keep track of the largest differences and adjusting pointers to handle out-of-range conditions.

### Correctness:

**True**
