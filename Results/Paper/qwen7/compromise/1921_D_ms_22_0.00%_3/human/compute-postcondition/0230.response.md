Output State: `ans` is still 0, `diff1` and `diff2` will hold the absolute differences between the last processed element `i` and the first and last elements of list `b` respectively, and `max_heap` will contain tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` where `index` is either 0 (indicating comparison with `b[0]`) or `m-1` (indicating comparison with `b[m-1]`), depending on which difference was larger during each iteration. The heap will include all such tuples from each iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `ans` will still be 0, `diff1` and `diff2` will store the final absolute differences calculated in the last iteration, and `max_heap` will contain a collection of tuples representing the largest differences found in each iteration, along with the indices used for those comparisons.
