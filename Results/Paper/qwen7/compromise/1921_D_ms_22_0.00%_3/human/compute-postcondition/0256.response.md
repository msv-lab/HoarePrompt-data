Postcondition: `ans` is now `-item[0]`, `diff1` and `diff2` will hold the absolute differences between the last processed element `i` and the first and last elements of list `b` respectively, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before popping. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is equal to `item[2] + 1` and `tp2` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 while `tp1` remains unchanged.
