Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the first element in list `a` and the first element in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the first element in list `a` and the last element in list `b`. The condition `diff1 > diff2` is true.**
