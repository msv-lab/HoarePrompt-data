Postcondition: `ans` remains 0, `max_heap` does not contain `item`, `item` is the smallest element from `max_heap` before it was removed, and either `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `ans` is set to the minimum of `diff1` (absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`) and `diff2` (absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`), and either `tp1` is incremented by 1 or `tp2` is decremented by 1 accordingly. If `item[2]` is within the range `[tp1, tp2-1]`, then `ans` is set to `0 - item[0]`, and if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1.
