Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0] - 1, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.**

Explanation: The variable `tp2` is decremented by 1, which means `tp2 -= 1` subtracts 1 from the current value of `tp2`. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `tp2`, we only know that it was previously `tp2 + 1`. After executing the code, `tp2` is now `tp2 - 1`, which translates to `ans` being increased by `-item[0] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
