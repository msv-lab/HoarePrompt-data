The loop condition is `while max_heap:`. This means the loop continues as long as `max_heap` is not empty.

To proceed to the next iteration of the loop, `max_heap` must still be non-empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `max_heap` is not empty at the start of the next iteration.

Let's break down the states:

- `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped: This is a postcondition from the previous iteration, but it doesn't affect the loop condition directly.
- `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`: This is also a result of the previous iteration and doesn't affect the loop condition.
- `ans` is increased by either `diff1` or `diff2` if `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`: This is another result of the previous iteration and doesn't affect the loop condition.
- If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by `-item[0] - 1`: This is also a result of the previous iteration and doesn't affect the loop condition.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to continue executing is ensuring that `max_heap` is not empty.

State: **`max_heap` must not be empty**
