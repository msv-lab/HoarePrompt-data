Output State: **`ans` is 0 - item[0], `max_heap` does not contain `item`, `item` is the smallest element from `max_heap` before it was removed, `item[2]` is within the range [tp1, tp2-1], and `item[2]` is greater than tp1.**

Explanation: The code `tp2 -= 1` decreases the value of `tp2` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, the range for `item[2]` is now `[tp1, tp2-1]`.
