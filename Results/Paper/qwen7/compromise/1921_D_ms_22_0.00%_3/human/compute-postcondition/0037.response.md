Output State: **`diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is non-empty (but now the top item has been popped), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, the current value of `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` and assigns it to `diff1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
