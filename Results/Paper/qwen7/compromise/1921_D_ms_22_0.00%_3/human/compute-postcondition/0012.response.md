State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list `a`**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` which is iterating over the list `a`.

2. **Determine Initial State of `i`**: For the loop to start executing, `i` must be initialized to the first element of the list `a`.

3. **List `a`**: The list `a` is already defined as a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `b`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i` to be the first element in the list `a`.
