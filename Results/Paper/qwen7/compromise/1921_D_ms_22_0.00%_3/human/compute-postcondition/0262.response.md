Output State: **`diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`. `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `item[1]` (which is the second element of the `item` tuple) and `b[tp1]` (where `b` is a list and `tp1` is an index). This value is stored in the variable `diff1`. The values of `max_heap`, `item`, `b`, and `tp1` remain unchanged from their initial state.
