Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` which is iterating over the list `a`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99.
   - `n` is the first integer entered.
   - `m` is the second integer entered.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.
   - `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple either `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2` is true or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1 > diff2` is false.
   - `tp1` is 0.
   - `tp2` is `m - 1`.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `i` is the first element in the list `a`.
   - `diff1` is the absolute difference between the first element in list `a` and the first element in list `b`.
   - `diff2` is the absolute difference between the first element in list `a` and the last element in list `b`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `i` in `a`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple either `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2` is true or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1 > diff2` is false, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the next element in list `a` and the first element in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the next element in list `a` and the last element in list `b`.**
