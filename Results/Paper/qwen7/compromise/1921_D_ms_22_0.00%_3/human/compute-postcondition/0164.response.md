Output State: **`diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2-1]`**.

Explanation: The code `tp2 -= 1` decrements the value of `tp2` by 1. The values of `diff1` and `total` remain unchanged. Therefore, `diff1` remains the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` now refers to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2-1]`.
