Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `max_heap = []` creates an empty list named `max_heap`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
