Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `max_heap` will be empty, `t` is greater than 0 - 1, `ans` is 0**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts them into a list of integers. The original values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `max_heap` remains empty, `t` is still greater than -1, and `ans` remains 0. The new variable `a` is created and assigned the list of integers.
