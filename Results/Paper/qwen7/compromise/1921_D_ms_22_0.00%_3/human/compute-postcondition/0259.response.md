Postcondition: `ans` is either the sum of its original value (0) and the maximum of `diff1` and `diff2`, or `-item[0]`. `diff1` and `diff2` remain the absolute differences between the second element of `item` and the first and last elements of list `b`, respectively. `tp1` and `tp2` are updated as follows: if `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then `ans` is updated to be the sum of `ans` and the maximum of `diff1` and `diff2`. Additionally, `tp2` is decreased by 1. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is set to `item[2] + 1` and `tp2` remains unchanged. If neither condition is met, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `tp1` remains unchanged.
