Output State: **`ans` is still 0, `diff1` and `diff2` will hold the absolute differences between the last processed element `i` and the first and last elements of list `b` respectively, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before popping.**

The code `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` pops the smallest element from the max-heap (which is implemented as a min-heap in Python's `heapq` module) and assigns it to `item`. The other variables (`ans`, `diff1`, `diff2`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that `max_heap` must contain at least one tuple is still valid.
