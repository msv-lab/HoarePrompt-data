Output State: **`tp2` is decremented by 1.**

The code `tp2 -= 1` decreases the value of `tp2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state of `tp2` is decremented by 1, while `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `item`, `ans`, `tp1`, and `tp2` (in terms of its new value) are part of the output state.
