Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is equal to `m - 1`, `tp2` is equal to 0, and `ans` is the sum of the differences calculated during each iteration of the loop as described.**

The code `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `t` is `t - 1`, while `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` retain their original values.
