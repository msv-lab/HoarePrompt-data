Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was popped.**

Explanation: The code `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` pops and returns the smallest element from `max_heap`. Since `max_heap` is a max-heap by convention (though Python's `heapq` is a min-heap), the smallest element in terms of the heap property is the largest actual value. After popping, `max_heap` no longer contains this item, and `item` holds its value.
