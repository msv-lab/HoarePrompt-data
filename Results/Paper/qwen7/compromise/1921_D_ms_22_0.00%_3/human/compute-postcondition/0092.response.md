Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99.
- `n` is the first integer entered.
- `m` is the second integer entered.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.
- `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`.
- `max_heap` is an empty list.
- `tp1` is equal to `m - 1`.
- `tp2` is equal to 0.
- `ans` is the sum of the differences calculated during each iteration of the loop as described.

The key part of the code snippet is the `print(ans)` statement. According to the precondition, `ans` is the cumulative sum of the differences calculated for each element in list `a` according to the conditions specified in the loop body. Since the exact loop body and the values of `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` is the result of the loop's calculations.

Output: **ans (where ans is the cumulative sum of the differences calculated for each element in list a according to the loop body)**
