Output State: **`ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `max_heap` contains `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`**

Explanation: The code pushes the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` onto the `max_heap`. Since `diff1` and `ans` are not affected by this operation, their values remain unchanged. The `max_heap` now includes the new tuple, but the specific structure of the heap (its order) is not specified by the given code, so we only note the addition of the tuple.
