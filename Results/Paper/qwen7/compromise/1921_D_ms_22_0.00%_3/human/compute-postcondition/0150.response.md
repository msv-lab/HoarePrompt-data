Output State: **`ans` is 0 - item[0], `max_heap` does not contain `item`, `item` is the smallest element from `max_heap` before it was removed, `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, `tp1` is equal to `tp1 + 1**.

Explanation: The value of `tp1` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and relationships between variables remain the same as the initial state. Therefore, `tp1` is now `tp1 + 1`.
