Output State: **`ans` remains 0, `max_heap` does not contain `item`, `item` is the smallest element from `max_heap` before it was removed, `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1] and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1] and `b[tp2]**.

Explanation: The code calculates `diff2` as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The initial conditions regarding `ans`, `max_heap`, `item`, and `diff1` are still valid.
