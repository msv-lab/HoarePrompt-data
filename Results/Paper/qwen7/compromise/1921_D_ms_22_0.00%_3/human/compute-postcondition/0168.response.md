Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0], `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.**

Explanation: The code `ans += -item[0]` updates the variable `ans` by adding the negation of the first element of the tuple `item` to it. The value of `item` is such that it represents the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`. The state of `max_heap` remains unchanged as no operation is performed on it within this line of code.
