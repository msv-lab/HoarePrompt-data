Output State: **`tp2` is `tp2 - 2`, `ans` is `ans + diff2`**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `tp2` is `tp2 - 1`. This means `tp2` is decremented by 1 from its original value. The code `ans += diff2` increments `ans` by the value of `diff2`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state reflects these changes.
