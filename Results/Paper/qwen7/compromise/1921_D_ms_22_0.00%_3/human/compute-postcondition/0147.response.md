Output State: **`ans` is 0 - item[0], `max_heap` does not contain `item`, `item` is the smallest element from `max_heap` before it was removed, and `item[2]` is within the range [tp1, tp2].**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `-item[0]` to its current value. Since `ans` initially is 0, after executing the line `ans += -item[0]`, `ans` becomes `0 - item[0]`. All other conditions remain unchanged: `max_heap` does not contain `item`, `item` is still the smallest element from `max_heap` before it was removed, and `item[2]` is still within the range [tp1, tp2].
