Output State: **`ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `max_heap` contains `(-diff1, i, 0)`**.

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` onto the `max_heap`. Since `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `diff1` is updated to `diff2` (which is now the same as `diff1`), making `diff1` and `diff2` both equal to `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. The `max_heap` now contains the new tuple.
