Output State: **`tp1` is incremented by 1, `tp2` remains the same, `diff1` is recalculated as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1] + 1`, `diff2` is recalculated as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, `ans` is increased by either the negative of `item[1]` plus the minimum of `diff1` and `diff2` (where `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1] + 1`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`), or simply the negative of `item[1]` depending on whether `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `item` is no longer in `max_heap`, `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` and `m` are the first and second integers entered respectively, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is not empty.**

This means that `tp1` has been incremented by 1, while `tp2`, `diff1`, `diff2`, `ans`, `item`, `max_heap`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` retain their previous states, with `diff1` and `diff2` being recalculated based on the new value of `tp1`.
