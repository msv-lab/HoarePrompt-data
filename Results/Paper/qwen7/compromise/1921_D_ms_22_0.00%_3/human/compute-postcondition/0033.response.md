Output State: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is a list containing tuples where the first element is either `-diff1` or `-diff2` depending on whether `diff1 > diff2` is true or false, the second element is each `i` from the list `a`, and the third element is either `0` or `m - 1`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have been executed, `max_heap` will contain a tuple for each element in list `a`. Each tuple in `max_heap` will have the form `(-diff, i, index)`, where `diff` is the maximum of `abs(i - b[0])` and `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `i` is an element from list `a`, and `index` is either `0` (if `diff1 > diff2`) or `m - 1` (if `diff1 <= diff2`). The variables `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
