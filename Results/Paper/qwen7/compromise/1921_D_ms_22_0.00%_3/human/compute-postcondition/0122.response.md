Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(new_i - b[m - 1])`, and `max_heap` contains either `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, new_i, m - 1)` depending on whether `diff1` is greater than `diff2` or not.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `diff1` to be the absolute difference between `i` (the current element in the list `a`) and the first element in the list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
