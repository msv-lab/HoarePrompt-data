Output State: **`ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(next_i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `max_heap` contains either `(-diff1, next_i, 0)`, `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`**

Explanation: The code pushes the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` onto the max heap. The values of `ans`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged. The max heap now contains both `(-diff1, next_i, 0)` and `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`.
