### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the function summary against the problem description and the provided examples.

1. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - We need to generate a permutation of length \( n \) such that for any two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (\( 1 \leq i, j < n \); \( i \neq j \)), \( p_i \) does not divide \( p_{i+1} \) and \( p_j \) does not divide \( p_{j+1} \).

2. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1()` generates a list of integers from 1 to \( n \), reverses every second element, and prints the result.
   - The key operation here is the reversal of every second element in the list.

3. **Program Code Analysis:**
   - The program iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each test case.
   - `func_1()` creates a list of integers from 1 to \( n \), reverses every second element, and prints the result.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For \( n = 4 \):
     - The generated list is `[1, 4, 3, 2]`.
     - Checking pairs: 
       - \( 1 \) does not divide \( 4 \)
       - \( 4 \) does not divide \( 3 \)
       - \( 3 \) does not divide \( 2 \)
       - \( 2 \) does not divide \( 1 \)
     - All pairs satisfy the condition.
   - For \( n = 3 \):
     - The generated lists are `[1, 3, 2]` and `[3, 1, 2]`.
     - Checking pairs:
       - For `[1, 3, 2]`: 
         - \( 1 \) does not divide \( 3 \)
         - \( 3 \) does not divide \( 2 \)
       - For `[3, 1, 2]`: 
         - \( 3 \) does not divide \( 1 \)
         - \( 1 \) does not divide \( 2 \)
     - Both lists satisfy the condition.

5. **General Verification:**
   - The approach of reversing every second element ensures that no two consecutive elements in the permutation will have the property that one divides the other.
   - This is because the reversed elements will disrupt the divisibility pattern.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a permutation that satisfies the given conditions for all tested cases. The logic of reversing every second element in the list effectively ensures that no two consecutive elements divide each other.

**Final: True**

The original assessment is accurate.
