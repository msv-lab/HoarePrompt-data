### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the given program has logical flaws in its approach to maximize the differences. Let's break down the issues and provide a corrected solution.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Swapping Logic:**
   - The condition `if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is incorrect. It does not guarantee the maximum difference. Instead, it should ensure that the largest possible values in `b` are matched with the smallest possible values in `a`.

2. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - The handling of remaining elements after the initial loop is also incorrect. The logic for appending differences should directly use the sorted `b` array without needing to recompute.

3. **Approach to Maximizing Differences:**
   - The original program attempts to swap elements but does not correctly maximize the differences. A simpler and more effective approach is to pair the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and vice versa.

#### Corrected Solution:

The correct approach is to sort both arrays and then pair the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and vice versa to maximize the differences.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n):
            ans += abs(a[i] - b[i])
        print(ans)
```

This corrected program:
1. Reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the sizes of arrays `a` and `b`.
3. It sorts array `a` in ascending order and array `b` in descending order.
4. It iterates through the first `n` elements of the sorted arrays and calculates the sum of absolute differences.
5. Finally, it prints the sum of the absolute differences for each test case.

This approach ensures that the differences are maximized by pairing the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and vice versa.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the flaws in the given program. The corrected program provided above addresses these issues and correctly maximizes the differences.

Final: **True**
