Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `n` must still be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - The state of `ans` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
