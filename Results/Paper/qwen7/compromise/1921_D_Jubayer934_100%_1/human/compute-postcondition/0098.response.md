Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `i` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `i`, `n`, or `ans`.
