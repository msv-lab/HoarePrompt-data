Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value `n-1`, indicating that every index from 0 to `n-1` in list `a` has been processed. The variable `ans` will contain the result of taking the absolute difference between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b`, as specified by the loop's operation.
