Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `b` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is `i + 1` (implying `i` was incremented in the previous iteration).
   - `temp` is `i + 1` (implying `temp` was updated to `i + 1` in the previous iteration).
   - `ans` is a list that now includes the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` was incremented in the previous iteration, `i` will now be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be `i + 1` and `n` must remain the same.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `temp` becomes `i + 1` (since it is updated to `i + 1` each iteration).
   - `ans` will include the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, but this does not affect the loop condition directly.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is `i + 1`, `ans` is a list that now includes the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`**.
