Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`. There are no other variables directly involved in the loop head.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0, as `range(n)` generates values from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to 0 and `n` must be a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the States**: Given the initial state:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split.
   - `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split.
   - `temp` is -1.
   - `ans` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input (converted to integers).
   - `b` is a list of the top `m` integers from the sorted input (converted to integers) in descending order.

   Since the loop depends on `i` and `n`, we need to adjust these variables. Specifically, `i` should be set to 0, and `n` must be a positive integer.

5. **Final State Adjustment**: Based on the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State:**
**`i` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer**
