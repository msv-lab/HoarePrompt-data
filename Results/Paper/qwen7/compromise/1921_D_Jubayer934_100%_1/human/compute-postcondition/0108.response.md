Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(temp, n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state**:
   - `ans` contains one additional element which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[n-i]`.
   - `i` is updated to `n-1`.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `ans` remains unchanged except for the appended value.
   - `temp` must still be less than or equal to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the new values for `i` and `n`**:
   - Since `i` is updated to `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should start from `temp` (the initial value of `i` before the update).
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`. Given that `i` is updated to `n-1` and `n` remains greater than 0, the loop will execute if `temp < n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be set to `temp` (the initial value before the update).
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is still greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`ans` contains one additional element which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[n-i]`, `i` is `temp`, `n` remains greater than 0, `ans` remains unchanged except for the appended value, `temp` must still be less than or equal to `n-1`.**
