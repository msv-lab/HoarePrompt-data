Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from user input in descending order, `i` is `n - 1`, `temp` is `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The line `temp = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is `n - 1`) to the variable `temp`. Since `i` was previously `n - 1`, `temp` is also `n - 1`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
