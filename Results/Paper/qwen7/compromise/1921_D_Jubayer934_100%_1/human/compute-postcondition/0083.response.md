Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the absolute difference between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[temp]` and `b[temp]`. and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `n`, nor does it affect the conditions involving `a[temp]` and `b[temp]` or `b[-(n - temp)]`. It simply exits the loop or conditional block it is within. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables remain the same, and the only change is that we break out of the loop or conditional statement.
