Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-2`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b`, `temp` must be less than or equal to `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the list `ans`. Initially, `i` is equal to `n-1`. After executing the line of code, `i` is decremented by 1, making it equal to `n-2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
