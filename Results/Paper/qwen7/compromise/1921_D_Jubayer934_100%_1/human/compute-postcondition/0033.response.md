Output State: **`temp` must be less than `n - 1`, `i` is `temp + 1`, `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the list `ans`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is set to `temp + 1`, and `ans` initially contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`. After executing the code, `ans` will contain that value in a list. The other variables (`temp` and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
