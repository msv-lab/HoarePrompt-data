Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - From the given information, `i` is initially set to `n - 1`.
   - `n` is an integer obtained from user input.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the valid range, i.e., `0 <= i < n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n - 1`, the loop will execute if `n > 0`.
   - We need to ensure that `i` is correctly initialized to `n - 1`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

- `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- `i` should be initialized to `n - 1`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from user input in descending order, `i` is `n - 1`, `temp` is `-1`, `ans` is an empty list, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from user input, `n` must be greater than 0**
