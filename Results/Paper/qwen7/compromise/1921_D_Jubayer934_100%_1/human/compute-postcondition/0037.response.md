Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list of integers.
- `b` is a list of integers.
- `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of either list `a` or `b`.
- `temp` is `n - 1`, so it holds the same value as `i`.
- `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices from `0` to `n-1`.

The `print(sum(ans))` statement calculates the sum of all elements in the `ans` list, which contains the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b` from index `0` to `n-1`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the sum. However, we know that `ans` is constructed from these absolute differences.

Output: **sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` from index 0 to n-1**
