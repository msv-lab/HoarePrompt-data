Output State: **`ans` now contains the original element plus the absolute difference between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]`, `i` is updated to `temp`, `n` remains greater than 0, `ans` remains unchanged except for the appended value, `temp` must still be less than or equal to `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]` to the list `ans`. Here, `temp` is the current value of `i`, and `-(n - temp)` is equivalent to `temp - n`. Therefore, the new value added to `ans` is `abs(a[temp] - b[temp - n])`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.
