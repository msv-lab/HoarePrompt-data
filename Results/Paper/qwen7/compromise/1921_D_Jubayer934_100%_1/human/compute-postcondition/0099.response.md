Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is 2, `ans` will now contain the value `abs(a[2] - b[2])`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition for `i` being set to 2 and breaking out of the loop are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, `i` remains 2, `n` remains greater than 0, and `ans` contains the updated list with the new element.
