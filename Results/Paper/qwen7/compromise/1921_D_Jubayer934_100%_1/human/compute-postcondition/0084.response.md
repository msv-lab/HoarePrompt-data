Postcondition: `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the postcondition remains as the initial precondition where `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.
