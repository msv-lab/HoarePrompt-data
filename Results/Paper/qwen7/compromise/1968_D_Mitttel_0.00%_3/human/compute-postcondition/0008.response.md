Postcondition: **`bodya_score` is the result of `calculate_score(PB)`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `PB` and `PS` are integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n, `p` is a list of n integers representing the permutation where 1 ≤ p[i] ≤ n for all 0 ≤ i < n, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n, `sasha_score` is the result of `calculate_score(PS)`, and `sasha_score` is greater than `bodya_score`.**
