Output State: **`a` is appended with an input value, `i` is 0, `n` remains greater than 0, `last_row` is the sum of its previous value and the last element of the last list in `a`, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the last list in `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` adds the last element of the last list in `a` to the current value of `last_row`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
