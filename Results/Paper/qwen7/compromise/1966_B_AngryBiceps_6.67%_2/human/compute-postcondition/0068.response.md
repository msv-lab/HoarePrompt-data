Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is -1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `a` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user
   - `first_row` is the first character of the last element in the list `a`
   - `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute again, the condition `i < n` must be true.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently -1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 0).
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` changes from -1 to 0.
   - `n` remains unchanged but still needs to be greater than 0.
   - The other variables (`a`, `first_row`, and `last_row`) do not change because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user, `first_row` is the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a`**
