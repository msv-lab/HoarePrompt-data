Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is the final length of the list `a` plus 1, `m` is an input integer from the user, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string.**

The code `last_row = ''` simply assigns an empty string to the variable `last_row`. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `first_row` remain unchanged.
