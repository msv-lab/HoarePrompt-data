Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the input from the user, `first_row` is the first character of the last element in the list `a` plus the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a` plus the last character of the last element in the list `a`**.

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` increments the value of `last_row` by the last character of the last element in the list `a`. Since `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is updated to be the original `last_row` plus this last character. All other variables remain unchanged.
