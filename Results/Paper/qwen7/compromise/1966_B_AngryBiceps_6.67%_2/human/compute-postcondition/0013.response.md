Output State: **`a` is a list with one element which is the input from the user; `first_row` is the first element of that input; `last_row` is increased by the last element of the only list in `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` increments `last_row` by the last element of the only list in `a`. Since `a` is a list with one element which is the input from the user, `a[-1]` refers to that single element, and `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last (and only) element of that single element (which is also the input from the user). Therefore, `last_row` is increased by the value of the input from the user.
