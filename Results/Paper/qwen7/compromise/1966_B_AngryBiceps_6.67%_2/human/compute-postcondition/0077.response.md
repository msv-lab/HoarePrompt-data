Output State: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing three elements where each element is the input from the user, `first_row` is the first character of the third element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the third element in the list `a`.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations (assuming `n` was at least 3), the variable `i` will be 2 (since it starts at -1 and increments by 1 each iteration), the list `a` will contain exactly `n` elements (each being an input from the user), `first_row` will be composed of the first characters of all the elements in `a` up to the last one, and `last_row` will be composed of the last characters of all the elements in `a` up to the last one.
