Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `_` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ _ ≤ 10^4; `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string.**

The code assigns an empty string to `last_row`. Since `n`, `m`, `_`, `a`, and `first_row` were not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged.
