Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is the final length of the list `a` plus 1, `m` is an input integer from the user, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, and `last_row` will be a string consisting of the last elements of each list in `a`.**

The code `first_row = ''` initializes `first_row` as an empty string. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
