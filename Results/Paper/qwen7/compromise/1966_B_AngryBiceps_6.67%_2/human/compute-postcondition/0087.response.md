Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` must be greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is an input from the user.
- `first_row` is composed of the first characters of all the elements in `a` up to the last one.
- `last_row` is composed of the last characters of all the elements in `a` up to the last one.
- The first character of `a[0]` is not the same as the last character of `a[0]`.
- The set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to a single set of characters, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

The `print('YES')` statement simply outputs the string "YES".

Output: **YES**
