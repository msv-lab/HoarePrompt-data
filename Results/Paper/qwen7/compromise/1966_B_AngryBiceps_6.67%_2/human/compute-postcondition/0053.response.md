Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as `-1`.
- `n` is the final length of the list `a`.
- `a` contains all the inputs provided by the user.
- `first_row` is a string consisting of the first elements of each list in `a`.
- `last_row` is a string consisting of the last elements of each list in `a`.

Additionally, it is stated that either:
- The first element of each list in `a` is not identical.
- The first element of each list in `a` is identical, but the length of the set of `first_row` is not equal to 1.
- The first element of each list in `a` is identical, and `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

Regardless of the conditions mentioned, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
