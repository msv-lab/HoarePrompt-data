Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list with one element which is the input from the user.
   - `first_row` is updated to include the first element of the only list in `a`.
   - `last_row` is the last element of the only list in `a`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `a` is a list with one element, the length of `a` does not change within the loop.
   - The values of `first_row` and `last_row` do not change within the loop either.

4. **Updating the State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` is now 1 (assuming it started from 0).
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `n` must be greater than 0, if `i` is 1, then `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Final State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a` remains the same as it is a list with one element.
   - `first_row` remains the same as it is the first element of the only list in `a`.
   - `last_row` remains the same as it is the last element of the only list in `a`.

**State:**
**`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list with one element which is the input from the user, `first_row` is updated to include the first element of the only list in `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the only list in `a`.**
