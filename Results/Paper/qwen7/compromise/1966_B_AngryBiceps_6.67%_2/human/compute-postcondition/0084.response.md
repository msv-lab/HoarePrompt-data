Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, and each element is an input from the user.
- `first_row` is composed of the first characters of all the elements in `a` up to the last one, and all these first characters are the same.
- `last_row` is composed of the last characters of all the elements in `a` up to the last one.
- The first character of `a[0]` is not the same as the last character of `a[0]`.

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
