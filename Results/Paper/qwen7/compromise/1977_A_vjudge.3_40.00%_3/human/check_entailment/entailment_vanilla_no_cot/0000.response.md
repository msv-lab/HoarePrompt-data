Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle all scenarios based on the problem description. Specifically:

1. **Case where `m` is odd and `n` is even**: The program incorrectly prints 'Yes' when it should print 'No'. For example, if `n=4` and `m=3`, the program should print 'No' because it's impossible to add or remove cubes to reach exactly 3 cubes starting from 0 cubes in 4 moves.

2. **Case where `m` is even and `n` is odd**: The program incorrectly prints 'Yes' when it should print 'No'. For example, if `n=5` and `m=4`, the program should print 'No' because it's impossible to add or remove cubes to reach exactly 4 cubes starting from 0 cubes in 5 moves.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the difference between `n` and `m` is even. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if abs(n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

This version checks if the absolute difference between `n` and `m` is even, which ensures that it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
