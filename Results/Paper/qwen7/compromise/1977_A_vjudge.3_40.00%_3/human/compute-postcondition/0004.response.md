Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives two positive integers n and m within the range 1 to 100 as part of a test case, and also an integer t where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned, but based on the constraints, it processes these values and might perform some operation or validation on them.**

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the function likely processes the test cases defined by `n`, `m`, and `t`, but without further details on the operations, the primary focus is on accepting and validating these parameters within their specified ranges.
