Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any logic to solve the problem described. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are placeholders for input operations but do not implement the required binary search algorithm or the logic to rearrange the permutation. Specifically, the program does not include the steps to rearrange the permutation using at most two swaps to ensure that `p_l` equals `x` after performing the binary search. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
