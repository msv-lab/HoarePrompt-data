Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, and `results` is a list containing strings with either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions met during each iteration of the loop. The length of the `results` list is equal to the value of `t`. For each input `n` and string `arr`, if `arr` contains exactly two '1's and includes the substring '11', the corresponding result is 'no'. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's (and does not meet the first condition), the result is 'yes'. Otherwise, the result is 'no'.
Code of the loop:
for r in results:
    print(r)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
