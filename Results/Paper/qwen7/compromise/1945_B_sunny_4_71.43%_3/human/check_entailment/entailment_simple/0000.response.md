Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. However, there is a logical error in the approach used to calculate the number of fireworks visible at any given time.

The program calculates `A` and `B` as follows:
- \( A = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + 1 \)
- \( B = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 1 \)

These calculations represent the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period of \( m \) minutes. However, the program incorrectly assumes that the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is simply the sum of these two values. This is incorrect because it does not account for the overlapping intervals during which fireworks from both installations might be visible simultaneously.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a \) and \( b \), and then determine how many fireworks can be visible at the same time within the interval defined by the LCM and the visibility duration \( m \).

Given the above analysis, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
