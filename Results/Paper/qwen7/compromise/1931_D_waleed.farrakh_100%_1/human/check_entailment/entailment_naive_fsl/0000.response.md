Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program works as expected:

1. **Frequency Calculation**: The `func_1` function calculates the frequency of pairs `(a_i % x, a_i % y)` for each element in the array. This helps in counting how many times a specific remainder combination appears.

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**: For each element `a_i`, it computes the required remainders `rx` and `ry`. It then checks if this combination exists in the frequency dictionary. If it does, it adds the count of such pairs to the total count.

3. **Modulo Operations**: The modulo operations ensure that the remainders are always positive, which is crucial for the logic to work correctly.

4. **Reading Input**: The `func_2` function reads the input from standard input and processes it using `func_1`. It handles multiple test cases efficiently.

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the program correctly identifies and counts the beautiful pairs according to the criteria specified. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
