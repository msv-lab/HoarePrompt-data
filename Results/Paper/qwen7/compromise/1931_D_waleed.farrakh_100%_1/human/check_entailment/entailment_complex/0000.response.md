### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires counting the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads the input from standard input and processes it to form test cases.
   - Each test case consists of \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and an array \(a\).
   - Calls `func_1` with the list of test cases.
   - Prints the results returned by `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Processes each test case to count the number of beautiful pairs.
   - Uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of pairs \((a \% x, a \% y)\).
   - Counts pairs based on the conditions specified in the problem statement.

4. **Frequency Dictionary Usage**:
   - For each element \(a\) in the array, calculates \((-a \% x + x) \% x\) and \(a \% y\).
   - Checks if the pair \((\text{rx}, \text{ry})\) exists in the frequency dictionary.
   - If it exists, adds the count of that pair to the result.
   - Updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair.

5. **Output**:
   - `func_1` returns a list of results for each test case.
   - `func_2` prints these results.

### Verification:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the conditions for a beautiful pair.
- The frequency dictionary approach ensures that all pairs are counted efficiently.
- The overall structure of the code matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given that both functions correctly implement the logic to find and count beautiful pairs, and the overall structure of the program aligns with the problem statement, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
