Reasoning:
1. The problem requires counting the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions.
2. The annotated program correctly reads the input and processes each test case using the `func_1` function.
3. `func_1` calculates the number of beautiful pairs for each test case by maintaining frequency counts of the pairs `(a % x, a % y)` and checking if the required conditions are met.
4. The logic in `func_1` ensures that for each element `a` in the array, it computes the necessary remainders and updates the frequency dictionary accordingly.
5. The program correctly outputs the results for each test case.

Given the detailed annotations and the logical flow of the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
