You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. Here’s a breakdown of why the program works as expected:

1. **Frequency Calculation**: The `func_1` function calculates the frequency of pairs `(a_i % x, a_i % y)` for each element in the array. This helps in counting how many times a specific remainder combination appears.

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**: For each element `a_i`, it computes the required remainders `rx` and `ry`. It then checks if this combination exists in the frequency dictionary. If it does, it adds the count of such pairs to the total count.

3. **Modulo Operations**: The modulo operations ensure that the remainders are always positive, which is crucial for the logic to work correctly.

4. **Reading Input**: The `func_2` function reads the input from standard input and processes it using `func_1`. It handles multiple test cases efficiently.

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the program correctly identifies and counts the beautiful pairs according to the criteria specified. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
