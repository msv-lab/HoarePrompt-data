Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `(n, x, y, arr) in test_cases`. This means the loop is iterating over each tuple in `test_cases`, and `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the variables being assigned from each tuple.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` contains the value of `count`.
   - All other variables remain the same.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are tuples left in `test_cases` to iterate over. After the previous iteration, the loop head variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`) have been updated to the values from the current tuple in `test_cases`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over tuples in `test_cases`, the only variables that change are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
   - `results` will contain the value of `count` from the previous iteration.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `results` still contains the value of `count` from the previous iteration.
   - `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are now set to the values from the next tuple in `test_cases`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`results` contains the value of `count` from the previous iteration, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are set to the values from the next tuple in `test_cases`**.
