Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element; `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `rx` using the formula `(-a % x + x) % x`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `a` and `x`, the expression `(-a % x + x) % x` is used directly to represent the new value of `rx`. The precondition that `arr` must contain at least one element remains unchanged.
