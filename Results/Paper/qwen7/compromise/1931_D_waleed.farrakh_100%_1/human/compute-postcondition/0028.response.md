Based on the initial state provided, `results` must contain at least one element. Since no specific value or type of the elements in `results` is mentioned, we can only say that `results` contains at least one element.

However, the `print` statement simply prints the first element of `results` without any additional context or formatting. Given that `results` contains at least one element, let's denote the first element of `results` as `result`.

Output: **result (where result is the first element of the `results` list)**
