Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is unchanged, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())` splits the string at `data[idx]` by spaces and converts each substring to an integer, assigning them to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. However, since the initial state does not specify the values of `data` and `idx`, these remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are now integers derived from the split and mapped operation, but their specific values are not known without further information.
