Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element; `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x; `ry` is a % y**

Explanation: The code snippet `ry = a % y` assigns the value of `a % y` to `ry`. The values of `arr` and `rx` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `ry` and retains the initial conditions for `arr` and `rx`.
