Postcondition: `arr` must contain at least one element; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, then `count` is increased by the size of the set `freq` containing the tuple `(rx, ry)`, where `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` is `a % y`. If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, then `count` is increased by 1 and `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1.
