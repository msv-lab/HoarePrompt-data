Output State: **`idx` is increased by 2; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the integer value of the first part of `data[idx]` split by spaces; `x` is the integer value of the second part of `data[idx]` split by spaces; `y` is the integer value of the third part of `data[idx]` split by spaces; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer; `test_cases` is a list that now includes a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the list `test_cases`. The values of `idx`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their previous states. The list `test_cases` now contains one additional tuple with the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
