Output State: **`idx` is equal to `t * 2`, `t` is equal to 0, `data` remains unchanged, `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `results = func_1(test_cases)` calls a function `func_1` with `test_cases` as an argument and assigns the return value to `results`. The values of `idx` and `t` are updated as per the initial state, and `data` remains unchanged. Since the exact return value of `func_1` is not specified, it is represented as `results`.
