Output State: **The loop will continue to execute as long as `results` contains at least one element. Once `results` no longer contains any elements, the loop will terminate.**

In natural language, this means that the loop will keep running and printing each element in `results` until there are no more elements left in `results`. At that point, the loop will finish executing, and no further iterations will occur. The state of `results` will be empty or will have been exhausted of its elements.
