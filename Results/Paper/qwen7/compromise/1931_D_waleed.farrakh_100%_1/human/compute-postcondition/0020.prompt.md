Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `data` remains unchanged, `test_cases` is an empty list, `idx` is 1
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())
    arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
    idx += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `idx` is increased by 2, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer from the split data; `x` is an integer from the split data; `y` is an integer from the split data; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer; `test_cases` is a list that now includes a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `idx` is increased by 4; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the integer value of the first part of `data[idx - 2]` split by spaces; `x` is the integer value of the second part of `data[idx - 2]` split by spaces; `y` is the integer value of the third part of `data[idx - 2]` split by spaces; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx - 1]` and converting each element to an integer; `test_cases` is a list that now includes a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` on spaces and converting each substring to an integer, `test_cases` is a list containing a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
