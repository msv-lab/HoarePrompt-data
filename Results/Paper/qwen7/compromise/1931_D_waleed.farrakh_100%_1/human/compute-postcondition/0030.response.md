Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter t, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each test case, it accepts three integers n, x, and y, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9. Additionally, it accepts a list arr of n integers, where each integer in the list is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the specified conditions and operations.**

Note: The specific operations and conditions are not detailed here as per the instruction to only describe the parameters and return value without detailing the operations.
