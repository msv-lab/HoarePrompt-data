Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The variables involved here are `result` and `results`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `idx` is equal to `t * 2`, and `t` is equal to 0. This means `idx` is 0.
   - `data` remains unchanged, but since it's not mentioned in the loop head, it doesn't affect the loop execution directly.
   - `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`. The loop will iterate over each element in `results`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. If `results` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `results` is the key variable for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `results` contains at least one element.
   - `idx` and `t` are not directly related to the loop's execution condition, so they don't need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `results` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`results` must contain at least one element**
