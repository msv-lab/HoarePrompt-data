Postcondition: `arr` contains at least one element, `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), `rx` is undefined, `ry` is undefined, and `count` is unchanged. If `current_pair` is found in `freq`, then the frequency of `current_pair` in `freq` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the frequency of `current_pair` in `freq` is set to 1.
