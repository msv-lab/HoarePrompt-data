Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer t, followed by t pairs of integers n, x, y, and a list of n integers arr. It then calls another function `func_1` with a list of these test cases and prints the results returned by `func_1`. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.**
