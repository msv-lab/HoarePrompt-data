Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `count` is 0, `results` contains the value of `count` from the previous iteration, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are set to the values from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `freq` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `arr` contains at least one element, `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), `rx` is undefined, `ry` is undefined, and `count` is unchanged. If `current_pair` is already in `freq`, then `freq[current_pair]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `arr` contains at least one element, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, `count` remains unchanged, and `freq[current_pair]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `current_pair` was already present in `freq`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `arr` contains all elements except the current `a`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, `count` is incremented by `freq[(a % x, a % y)]`, and `freq[current_pair]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `current_pair` was already present in `freq`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
