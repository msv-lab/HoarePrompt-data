Output State: **`idx` is increased by 2, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is the integer value of the first part of `data[idx]` split by spaces, `x` is the integer value of the second part of `data[idx]` split by spaces, `y` is the integer value of the third part of `data[idx]` split by spaces, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer, `test_cases` is a list that now includes a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`**.

This means that the variables `idx` and `t` have been updated according to their previous conditions, while `n`, `x`, and `y` have been set to the respective parts of `data[idx]` after splitting by spaces. The variable `arr` has been updated to a list of integers from `data[idx + 1]` after splitting and conversion. The list `test_cases` now includes a new tuple with the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
