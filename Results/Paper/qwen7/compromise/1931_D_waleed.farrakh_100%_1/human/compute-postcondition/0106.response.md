Postcondition: `arr` contains at least one element, `current_pair` is `((-a % x + x) % x, a % y)`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`. If `(rx, ry)` is found in `freq`, then `count` is increased by `freq[rx, ry]`. Otherwise, the values of `count`, `current_pair`, `rx`, and `ry` remain unchanged.
