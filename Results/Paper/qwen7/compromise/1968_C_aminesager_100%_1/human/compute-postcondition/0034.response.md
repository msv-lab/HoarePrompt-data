Output State: **`i` is -1, `a` is a list starting with 1000 and then each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element in `T`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is `t - 1`**.

The code `t = t - 1` subtracts 1 from the value of `t`. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `t`, only that it must be non-empty. Therefore, we can only express the new state of `t` as `t - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
