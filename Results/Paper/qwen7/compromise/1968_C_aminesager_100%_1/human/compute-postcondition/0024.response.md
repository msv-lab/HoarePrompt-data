Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `a` is updated such that its last element is now equal to `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends to list `a` the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `T[i - 1]`. Given that initially `i` is `n-1`, `i - 1` is `n-2`. Since the operation modifies `a`, the last element of `a` changes to the sum of the second last element of `a` (which was `a[i - 1]`) and the second last element of `T` (which is `T[i - 1]`). The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `i` is decremented by 1.
