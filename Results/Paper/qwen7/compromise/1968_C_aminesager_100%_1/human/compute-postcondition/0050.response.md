Output State: The loop will continue to execute until `t` becomes 0. After all iterations, `t` will be `0`. For each iteration, `n` will be set to a new input value, and `a` will be updated based on the new `n` and the input list `T`. The final `result` will be a string containing the cumulative sums starting from 1000 for each `n` in the form of space-separated integers. Each `result` string corresponds to one iteration and will be printed during that iteration.

Since the loop runs until `t` becomes 0, the final output state will be determined by the last value of `n` and the corresponding list `T`. The `result` will be the cumulative sums starting from 1000 for the last `n`, and this will be the last string printed. All previous `result` strings will also be part of the output, each corresponding to the respective `n` and `T` values from earlier iterations.
