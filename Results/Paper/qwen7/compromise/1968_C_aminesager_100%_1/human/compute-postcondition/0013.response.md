Output State: `i` is `n-1`; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list starting with 1000 followed by the sum of the first `n-1` elements of `T` added cumulatively to the previous element in `a`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed `n-1` iterations. The list `a` will start with the initial value of 1000, and each subsequent element will be the cumulative sum of the corresponding elements from the list `T` up to the current index. For example, if `n` is 5, `a` will be `[1000, 1000+T[0], 1000+T[0]+T[1], 1000+T[0]+T[1]+T[2], 1000+T[0]+T[1]+T[2]+T[3]]`.
