Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 3 (since `i` was 2 and now it will be 3).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 3.

5. **Consider Other Variables:**
   - The variable `a` mentioned in the problem statement is not part of the loop head. Therefore, its state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Based on the above steps, the updated states are:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
