Output State: `i` is `-1`, `a` is a list starting with 1000 and then each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element in `T`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be decremented below 0 (specifically, it becomes `-1`), as the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. The list `a` will have been updated such that each new element is the cumulative sum of the initial value (1000) and the elements of `T` up to that point. Therefore, `a` will start with 1000 and each following element will be the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T`.
