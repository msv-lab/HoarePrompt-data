Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is the first integer input split from input.
- `k` is the second integer input split from input.
- `n` is greater than `k`.
- The condition \(k - 1 < n - k + 1\) holds true.

We need to determine the output of the following code snippet:
```python
print(n - k + 1, 1)
```

Let's break down the expression `n - k + 1`:
- Since `n > k`, the expression `n - k + 1` will be a positive integer.
- The term `1` is a constant integer.

Therefore, the print statement will output two values separated by a space: the result of `n - k + 1` and the integer `1`.

Output: **n - k + 1 1**
