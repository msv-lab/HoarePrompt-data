Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is the first integer input split from input.
- `k` is the second integer input split from input.
- `n` is greater than `k`.
- The condition \(k - 1 < n - k + 1\) holds true.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `n` and `k`, as long as they satisfy the given conditions.

Output: **YES**
