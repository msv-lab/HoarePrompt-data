Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is the first integer input split from input.
- `k` is the second integer input split from input.
- `n` is equal to `k`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(n)
```

Given that `n` is equal to `k`, and both are positive integers within the range \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), the value printed will be the value of `n`.

Output: **n**
