Postcondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. If n is less than k, n remains unchanged and k remains unchanged. If n equals k, n and k remain unchanged. If n is greater than k and k - 1 < n - k + 1 does not hold, n and k remain unchanged. Otherwise, n and k remain unchanged.**
