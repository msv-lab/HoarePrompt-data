Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is the first integer input split from input.
- `k` is the second integer input split from input.
- `n` is greater than `k`.
- \(k - 1 \geq n - k + 1\).

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because it is hardcoded to print `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
