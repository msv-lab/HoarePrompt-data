### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - The program checks if \( n < k \). If true, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy any jewels with fewer coins than required. This is correct.
   - If \( n == k \), it prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with the price equal to \( n \). This is also correct because Alice will buy all her coins worth of jewels in one stall.
   - If \( n > k \), it checks if \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \). If true, it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls: the first stall with price \( n - k + 1 \) and the second stall with price 1. This condition is not sufficient to cover all cases where more than 2 stalls might be needed.

3. **Stall Setup and Pricing**:
   - The current logic only handles the case where \( n > k \) and \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \) by setting up 2 stalls. However, the problem requires handling cases where more than 2 stalls are needed. For example, in the third test case, 8 stalls are required, which the current implementation does not account for.
   - The program should be able to dynamically set up the minimum number of stalls required to ensure Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels. The current implementation only considers specific cases and does not generalize to all possible scenarios.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program should output the number of stalls and the prices for each stall if the answer is "YES". The current implementation only handles the case of 1 or 2 stalls, which is insufficient. It needs to generate the correct number of stalls and prices for any valid scenario.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the general case where more than 2 stalls are required. Specifically, it fails to meet the requirement of setting up at most 60 stalls and providing the correct prices for those stalls when necessary. The current logic is too restrictive and does not cover all possible scenarios.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
