### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two integers `n` and `k` as input.
   - It checks if `n` is less than `k`. If true, it prints "NO" and exits.
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints "YES", `1`, and `n`, which matches the expected output for when Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with all her coins in one stall.
   - If `n` is greater than `k`, it further checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. If true, it prints "YES", `2`, and the values `n - k + 1` and `1`, which means setting up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - If the condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is false, it prints "NO".

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The main loop `for _ in range(int(input())):` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` which processes `n` and `k` for that test case.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The constraints are handled correctly within the function:
     - `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`
     - `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18`
   - The function ensures that the number of stalls does not exceed 60, as required.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the example provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The function handles all edge cases and outputs the results in the correct format.

### Correctness:
**True**
