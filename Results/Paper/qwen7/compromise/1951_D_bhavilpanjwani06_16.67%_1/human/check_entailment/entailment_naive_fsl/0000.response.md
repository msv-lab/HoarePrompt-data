Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to consider scenarios where more than two stalls are needed to ensure Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.

For example, consider the following input:
- \( n = 255 \)
- \( k = 8 \)

According to the problem, Bob needs to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 8 jewels. The program checks only two conditions:
1. If \( n < k \), it prints "NO".
2. If \( n == k \), it prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with \( n \) coins.
3. If \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \), it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with prices \( n - k + 1 \) and 1.

However, this logic does not cover the scenario where more than two stalls are required. For instance, with \( n = 255 \) and \( k = 8 \), the program would incorrectly print "NO" because \( k - 1 = 7 \) is not less than \( n - k + 1 = 248 \).

To correctly solve this problem, Bob needs to set up stalls in such a way that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels. One possible solution involves setting up stalls with decreasing prices, ensuring that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels by the end. The provided program does not implement this logic, making it incorrect.
