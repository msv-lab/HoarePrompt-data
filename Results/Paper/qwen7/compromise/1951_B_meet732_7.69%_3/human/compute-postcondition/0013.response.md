Output State: **The program returns n - 1**

Given the initial state:
- `ind` is an empty list
- `a` is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows
- `k` is 14
- `x` is the 14th element of the list `a`
- `c` is either 0 or 2

The code snippet `return n - 1` simply returns the value of `n` minus 1. Since `n` represents the number of elements in the list `a`, the program returns `n - 1`.
