Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
- We need to perform operations on an array `a` of length `n` to form a set `S`.
- Each operation involves selecting an index `i`, inserting `a_i + i` into `S`, and deleting `a_i` from `a`.
- After `n` operations, `a` will be empty, and `S` will contain unique values.
- We need to sort `S` in decreasing order to form array `b`.
- The goal is to find the lexicographically largest possible `b`.

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   for _ in range(t):
       func_1()
   ```
   This part correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.

2. **Function Definition:**
   ```python
   def func_1():
       n = int(input())
       a = list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```
   Here, `n` is read, and the array `a` is populated with space-separated integers.

3. **Modifying Array `a`:**
   ```python
       for i in range(n):
           a[i] += i + 1
   ```
   This step adds `i + 1` to each element `a[i]`. This is necessary because we will insert `a[i] + i` into the set `S`.

4. **Creating Set `S` and Counting Elements:**
   ```python
       counter = Counter(a)
       cur = 0
       a = list(set(a))
       a.sort(reverse=True)
   ```
   - `Counter(a)` counts occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - Converting `a` to a set removes duplicates.
   - Sorting `a` in reverse order prepares it for constructing the final array `b`.

5. **Constructing the Final Array `b`:**
   ```python
       cnt = n - len(a)
       ans = []
       for i in range(len(a)):
           if i > 0:
               adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
               for j in range(adv):
                   ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
               cnt -= adv
               cur -= adv
           ans.append(a[i])
           counter[a[i]] -= 1
           cur += counter[a[i]]
       for _ in range(cnt):
           ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
       print(*ans)
   ```
   - `cnt` is the number of additional elements needed to reach `n`.
   - `ans` is constructed by ensuring the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` are filled appropriately.
   - `cur` keeps track of the remaining count of each element in `a`.

### Verification
- The logic for filling the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` seems correct. It ensures that the gaps are filled in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order of the final array `b`.
- The handling of `cnt` and `cur` ensures that the final array `b` is formed correctly.

### Conclusion
The program appears to follow the correct logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
