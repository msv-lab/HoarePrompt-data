Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where multiple elements in the array `a` are the same and should be inserted into the set `S` multiple times. According to the problem description, inserting an element that is already present in the set will not change the elements of the set. However, the current implementation uses a `Counter` to keep track of the occurrences of each element and only inserts unique elements into the set `S`. This means that if an element appears more than once in the array `a`, it will only be inserted into the set once, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2
1 1
```
The expected output should be `[2, 2]` because both `1 + 1` and `1 + 2` should be inserted into the set `S`. However, the current implementation will only insert `2` once, resulting in the output `[2]`.

To fix this, the program should ensure that each element plus its index is inserted into the set `S` regardless of how many times the original element appears in the array `a`.
