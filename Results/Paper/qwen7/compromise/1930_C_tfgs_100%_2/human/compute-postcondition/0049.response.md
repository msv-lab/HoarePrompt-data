Output State: **`i` is 1, `cnt` is decreased by `adv` for the total number of iterations, `cur` is decreased by `adv`, `ans` now includes `a[2] - (adv - 1)`, `a[2] - (adv - 2)`, ..., `a[2] - 1`, `a[1] - 1`, `adv` is equal to `min(a[1] - a[2], cnt, cur) - adv`, `j` is `adv - 1 - adv`, `ans` now includes `a[1]`, `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `counter[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the value of `counter[a[i]]` by 1. Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]`. So, `counter[a[1]]` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
