Output State: **`cnt` is `n - len(a)`, each element in the list `a` is now sorted in descending order, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ans`. This does not affect the values of `cnt`, the sorted state of list `a`, or the value of `cur`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and a new empty list `ans` is created.
