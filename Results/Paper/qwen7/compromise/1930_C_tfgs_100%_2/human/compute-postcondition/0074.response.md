Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for _ in range(cnt):`. This means the loop variable is an underscore `_`, but it's not used in the loop body. The key variable here is `cnt`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` must be greater than 0.
   - `ans` is a list where the last element is now the second last element minus 1.

3. **Determine if the loop can execute again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `cnt` must be greater than 0. Since the loop runs `range(cnt)` times, `cnt` must be at least 1 for the loop to run even once. After each iteration, `cnt` is decremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop runs `range(cnt)` times, after one iteration, `cnt` is reduced by 1. Therefore, if `cnt` was initially greater than 0, after one iteration, `cnt` must be at least 0 (but since it must be greater than 0 for the loop to run, it must be 1 or more).
   - The list `ans` remains unchanged in terms of its structure, but the last element is updated to be the second last element minus 1. This operation does not affect the condition for the loop to continue.

5. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `cnt` must be greater than 0, but since it was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration and we just decreased it by 1, `cnt` must now be 1 (the smallest value it can take for the loop to run again).
   - The list `ans` remains the same in terms of its structure and the last element being the second last element minus 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`cnt` must be 1, `ans` is a list where the last element is now the second last element minus 1**.
