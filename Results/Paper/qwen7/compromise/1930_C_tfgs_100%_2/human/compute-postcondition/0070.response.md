Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(cnt):`. The variables involved here are `_` (which is an underscore, often used as a throwaway variable) and `cnt`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: The loop will execute as long as `cnt` is greater than 0. The underscore `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution condition.

3. **Consider the initial state**: We know that `cnt` is currently 0, and `ans` contains all the calculated values based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`. However, these facts about `ans` and `a` do not directly impact the loop's execution condition.

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute, `cnt` must be greater than 0. Since `cnt` is currently 0, it needs to be adjusted to a value greater than 0.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `cnt`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cnt` must be greater than 0**
