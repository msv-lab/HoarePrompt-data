Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the state changes at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a[i]` is increased by `i + 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was increased by 1 (since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration).
   - Therefore, if the previous value of `i` was `k`, then at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is now `k + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Hence, `i` will be `k + 1` and it needs to be less than `n`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `a[i]` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `a[i]` will be updated by increasing its current value by `(i + 1) + 1 = i + 2`.

However, since we are only asked to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, we focus on `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**
