Postcondition: `i` is 2, `cnt` is decreased by `adv` for the total number of iterations, `cur` is decreased by `adv`, `ans` is a list that now includes the values of `a[2] - (adv - 1)`, `a[2] - (adv - 2)`, ..., `a[2] - 1`, `a[1] - 1`, `adv` is equal to `min(a[1] - a[2], cnt, cur) - adv`, `j` is `adv - 1 - adv`. If `i` is greater than 0, `cur` is updated to `cur + counter[a[2]]`.
