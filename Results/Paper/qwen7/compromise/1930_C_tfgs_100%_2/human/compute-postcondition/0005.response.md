Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` + 1, `n` must be greater than `i + 1` + 1, `a[i]` is `a[i] + i + 1`**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += i + 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by `i + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is `i + 1`, so `i` becomes `i + 1 + 1`. The condition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` remains unchanged, but now `i + 1` is updated to `i + 2`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`. The value of `a[i]` is updated to its original value plus `i + 1`.
