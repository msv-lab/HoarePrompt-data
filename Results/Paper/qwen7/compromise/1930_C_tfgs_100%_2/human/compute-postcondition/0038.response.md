Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and it ranges from `0` to `adv - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `cnt` is decreased by `adv`.
   - `cur` is decreased by `adv`.
   - `ans` is a list that now includes the value of `a[2]` and `a[2] - j - 1`.
   - `adv` is equal to `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`.
   - `j` is 0.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `cnt` is decreased by `adv` and `cur` is decreased by `adv`. Since `j` starts at 0, these values will be further decreased in subsequent iterations.
   - `ans` will include additional elements based on the current value of `j` in each iteration.
   - `adv` is recalculated based on the new values of `cnt` and `cur` after the first iteration.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration, starting from 0.

Given that `j` starts at 0 and the loop will execute for `adv` times, the state at the start of the next iteration (when `j` is 1) will be:

- `i` remains 2.
- `cnt` is decreased by `adv` once.
- `cur` is decreased by `adv` once.
- `ans` will include the value of `a[2]` and `a[2] - 1` (since `j` is 0).
- `adv` will be recalculated based on the new values of `cnt` and `cur`.
- `j` will be 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, `cur` is decreased by `adv`, `ans` is a list that now includes the value of `a[2]` and `a[2] - 1`, `adv` is equal to `min(a[1] - a[2], cnt, cur)`, `j` is 1**.
