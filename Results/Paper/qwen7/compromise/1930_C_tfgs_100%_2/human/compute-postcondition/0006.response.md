Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `i + 1` + 1
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1` + 1
- `a[i]` is `a[i] + i + 1`

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The initial value of `i` is given as `i + 1` + 1, which simplifies to `i + 2`.
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (since `range(n)` increments `i` by 1 each time).

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` must be greater than `i + 1` + 1, which means `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.

3. **Variable `a[i]`:**
   - The value of `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 2`, so `a[i]` will be `a[i+2]` in the next iteration.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value (`i + 2`) to `i + 3`.
- `n` must still be greater than `i + 3` because the loop condition checks if `i < n`.
- `a[i]` will be `a[i+3]` since `i` will be `i + 3` in the next iteration.

### Final State:
- `i` will be `i + 3`.
- `n` must be greater than `i + 3`.
- `a[i]` will be `a[i+3]`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `i + 3`, `n` must be greater than `i + 3`, `a[i]` is `a[i+3]`**
