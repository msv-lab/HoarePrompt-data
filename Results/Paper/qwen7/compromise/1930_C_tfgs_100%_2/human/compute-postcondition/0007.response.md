Output State: **`i` is `i + 3`, `n` must be greater than `i + 3`, `a[i]` is the value of `a[i+3] + i + 1`**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += i + 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by `i + 1`. Given that `a[i]` was previously `a[i+3]`, now `a[i]` becomes `a[i+3] + i + 1`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged according to the precondition.
