Output State: **`adv` must be greater than 0; `ans` is a list with three elements where the first two elements are `a[i - 1] - 1` and the third element is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `ans`. The new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. Since `ans` originally contained two elements, it now contains three elements: the first two are `a[i - 1] - 1`, and the third is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. The conditions and values of `adv` remain unchanged.
