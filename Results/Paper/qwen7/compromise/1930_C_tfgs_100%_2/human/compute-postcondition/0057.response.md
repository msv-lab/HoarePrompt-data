Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `for j in range(adv)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `adv`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `j` is 1
   - `adv` is `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`
   - `ans` contains `a[1] - 2`
   - `ans` now also contains `a[2] - 1 - 1`

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `adv`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. Therefore, `j` will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.
   - `adv` remains unchanged unless it is modified within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume `adv` stays the same.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` is incremented from 1 to 2.
   - `adv` remains the same as calculated previously.
   - `ans` does not change because it is not modified within the loop head.

Given these steps, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 2, `adv` is `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `ans` contains `a[1] - 2`, `ans` now also contains `a[2] - 1 - 1`**
