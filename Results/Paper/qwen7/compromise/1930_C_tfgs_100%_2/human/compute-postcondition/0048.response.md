Output State: **`i` is 1, `cnt` is decreased by `adv` for the total number of iterations, `cur` is decreased by `adv`, `ans` is a list that now includes the values of `a[2] - (adv - 1)`, `a[2] - (adv - 2)`, ..., `a[2] - 1`, `a[1] - 1`, `adv` is equal to `min(a[1] - a[2], cnt, cur) - adv`, `j` is `adv - 1 - adv`, `ans` now includes `a[1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `a[i]` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` was 2, it is now decremented to 1. The other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state, except that `ans` now includes the value of `a[1]`.
