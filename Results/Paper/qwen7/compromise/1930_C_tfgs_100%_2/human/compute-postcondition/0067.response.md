Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `adv` is `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `ans` contains `a[1] - 3`, `ans` contains `a[2] - 3`, `ans` contains `a[1] - 4`, `ans` now also contains `a[1] - 4 - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `cur` is `cur - adv`, `counter[a[2]]` is decreased by 1, `counter[a[1]]` is decreased by 1, `cur` is increased by `counter[a[i]]` (which is `counter[a[2]]`).**

Explanation: The code `cur += counter[a[i]]` increments `cur` by the value of `counter[a[i]]`, which is `counter[a[2]]` since `i` is 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
