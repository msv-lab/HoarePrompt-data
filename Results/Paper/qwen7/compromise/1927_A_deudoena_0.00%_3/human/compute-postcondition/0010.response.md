Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **`ind1`**: This is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`.
2. **`ind2`**: This is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`.
3. **`inpstr`**: This is the string input by the user.
4. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
5. **`n`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10.
6. **`s`**: A string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'.
7. **`outind`**: This is initialized to 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the following:

- `len(inpstr)` gives the total length of the string `inpstr`.
- `ind2` is the index of the last 'B' in `inpstr`.
- `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`.

The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` calculates the number of characters between the first and last 'B' in `inpstr`, excluding these two 'B' characters themselves.

Given that `ind1` and `ind2` are indices of 'B' in `inpstr`, the difference `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` will give the number of characters between the first and last 'B', inclusive of the characters between them but not including the 'B' characters themselves.

Since the exact values of `ind1` and `ind2` are not specified, we can only express the result in terms of these indices.

Output: **len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 (the number of characters between the first and last 'B' in inpstr, excluding the 'B' characters themselves)**
