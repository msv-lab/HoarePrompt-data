Output State: **`ind1` is 0, `inpstr` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ind1` to 0. No other changes are made to the other variables (`inpstr`, `t`, `n`, `s`). Therefore, their values remain as per the initial state.
