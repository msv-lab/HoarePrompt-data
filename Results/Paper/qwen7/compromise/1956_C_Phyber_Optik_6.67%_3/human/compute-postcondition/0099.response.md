Output State: **j is n + r + 1 and n + r + 1 is the value derived from the condition \( r \) being the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will be equal to `n + r + 1`. The value of `n + r + 1` is determined by the initial condition where `r` is the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \). This value does not change during the loop iterations because the loop increments `j` from 1 to `n + r + 1`, and once `j` reaches `n + r + 1`, the loop terminates.
