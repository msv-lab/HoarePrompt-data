Output State: **`sum` is `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least `1`, `t` is an input integer representing the number of remaining iterations, `r` is `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is assigned the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` updates the value of `sum` by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. The other variables (`j`, `n`, `t`, `r`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
