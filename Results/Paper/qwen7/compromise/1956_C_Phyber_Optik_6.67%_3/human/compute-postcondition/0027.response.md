To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the loop head and identify the relevant variables and their initial states.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `j` is used in the `range` function.
   - The loop variable `n` is used in the `range` function.
   - The loop variable `r` is used in the condition inside the loop body.

2. **Initial States:**
   - `Output State`: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`. For each iteration, if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, then `r` is set to `i` and `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `sum` is incremented by `i * n`.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - The loop will iterate from `j = 1` to `j = n + r + 1`.
   - The loop body checks the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and updates `r` and `sum` accordingly.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop starts with `j = 1`, the initial value of `j` should be `1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j <= n + r + 1`. Therefore, `n + r + 1` must be a valid integer.
   - The variable `r` is updated within the loop based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. Thus, `r` must be initialized to a value that allows the loop to proceed correctly.

### Final Adjusted State:

- `j` must be `1` to start the loop.
- `n` must be a positive integer to ensure the loop can proceed.
- `r` must be initialized to a value that allows the loop to run correctly, ensuring the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` can be evaluated.

Given these considerations, the adjusted state before the loop starts is:

**State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be a positive integer, `r` must be an integer that allows the loop to proceed correctly.**
