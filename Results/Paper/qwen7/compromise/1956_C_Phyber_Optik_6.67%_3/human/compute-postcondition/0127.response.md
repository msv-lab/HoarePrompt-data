Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `r` is an integer.
- `n + r + 1` is a positive integer, implying that `n + r` must be at least 0.
- `j` is a value such that `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

This statement will print the integer `1` followed by the value of `j`, with no newline character at the end (`end=' '`).

Given the information, the precise output is:
Output: **1 [j] (where j is a value less than or equal to n)**
