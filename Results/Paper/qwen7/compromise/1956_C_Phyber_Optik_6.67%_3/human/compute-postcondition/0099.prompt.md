Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is n, r is the largest integer such that r * n < n * (n + 1) / 2, and sum is the sum of n * (n + 1) // 2 for each iteration where n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n, otherwise sum is the sum of i * n for those iterations.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
    if j <= n:
        print(1, j, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))
    else:
        print(2, j % n, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n + r + 1` is the value derived from the condition \( r \) being the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \). If \( j \leq n \), the value of `n + r + 1` remains unchanged. If \( j > n \), the value of `n + r + 1` remains unchanged as well.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is 2 and `n + r + 1` is the value derived from the condition \( r \) being the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \). Since the if and else parts are identical, the value of `n + r + 1` remains unchanged regardless of the condition `j <= n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is 3 and `n + r + 1` is the value derived from the condition \( r \) being the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
