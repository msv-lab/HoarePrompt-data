Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `r` is an integer.
- `n + r + 1` is a positive integer.
- `j` is `j + 1`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
2. The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object into positional arguments for the `print` function.
3. Therefore, the `print` function will print the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`.

Output: **1 2 ... n**
