Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is a positive integer, and the value of \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) is greater than \( i \times n \); `r` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of `i`, which is initially 1. The conditions involving `n` remain unchanged because no operations are performed on `n`. Therefore, `n` remains a positive integer, and the inequality \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \) still holds true since `i` is 1.
