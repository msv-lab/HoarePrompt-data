Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is `n + r + 1`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `r` is the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, we need to decrease `t` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - The values of `j`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is `n + r + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `r` is the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \), and `t` is decreased by 1**.
