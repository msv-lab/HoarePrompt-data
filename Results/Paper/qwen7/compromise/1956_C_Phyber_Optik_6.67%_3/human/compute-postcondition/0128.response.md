Output: **1 2 ... n (where n is the non-negative integer)**

Explanation:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`.
- The `*` operator is used to unpack this range into individual arguments for the `print` function.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.
