Output State: **`sum` is equal to either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or increased by `(i + 1) * n`, depending on whether `n * (n + 1) // 2 > (i + 1) * n` holds true; `sum` is updated by adding `i * n` to its current value.**

Explanation: The code updates `sum` by adding `i * n` to its current value. The initial conditions for `sum` remain unchanged unless `i * n` is added to it. The values of `n` and `i` also remain the same. The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > (i + 1) * n` and the value of `r` (which was defined previously) do not affect the current operation.
