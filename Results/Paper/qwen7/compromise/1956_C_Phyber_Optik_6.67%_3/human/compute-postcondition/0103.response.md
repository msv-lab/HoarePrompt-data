Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - The variable `i` starts from 1 (inclusive) and goes up to `n` (inclusive).
   - The variable `n` is given as an input integer.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i` reaches `n`.

4. **Adjust the given states**:
   - The state before the loop starts is given as: `j` is \( n + r + 1 \), `n` is an input integer, the number of remaining iterations is \( t - 1 \), `sum` is 0, `r` is 0.
   - We need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` to ensure the loop can execute.
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`, we need to ensure `n` is at least 1.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - `j` is \( n + r + 1 \) and since `r` is 0, `j` is \( n + 1 \).
   - `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`sum`, `t`, and `r`) do not affect the loop execution directly.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

**State: **`j` is \( n + 1 \), `n` must be at least 1, `sum` is 0, `t` is an input integer representing the number of remaining iterations, `r` is 0**.
