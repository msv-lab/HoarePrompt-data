Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `r` is an integer.
- `n + r + 1` is a positive integer, which means `n + r` must be at least 0 (since adding 1 makes it positive).
- `j` is defined as `j_start + 2`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

Here, `1` is explicitly given and will be printed directly. For `j`, since `j` is defined as `j_start + 2`, we need to know the value of `j_start` to determine `j`. However, the value of `j_start` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only express `j` in terms of `j_start`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **1 [j_start + 2]**
