Output State: **`sum` is equal to `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r` is equal to `i`, `n` and `i` are integers.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sum` by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. The variables `r`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `r` is still equal to `i`, and `n` and `i` retain their integer values.
