Output State: **`sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `t` is an input integer representing the number of remaining iterations, `r` is `i`, and the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sum` by adding the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. Since `sum` was initially 0, after this operation, `sum` becomes `n * (n + 1) // 2`. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `t`, `r`, and the condition) remain unchanged from their initial states.
