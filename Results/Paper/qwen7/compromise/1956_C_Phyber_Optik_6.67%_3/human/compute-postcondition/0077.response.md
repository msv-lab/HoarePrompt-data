Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the value `n + r + 1`. These are the only objects that need to be considered for adjustment.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being 1 because the range function `range(1, n + r + 1)` starts from 1.

3. **Determine the Value of `n + r + 1`**: This value is derived from the initial values of `i` and `r`. Since `i` is `n` and `r` is the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \), we need to ensure that `n + r + 1` is correctly set.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` should be initialized to 1.
   - `n + r + 1` should be calculated based on the given conditions.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n`.
- `r` is the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).
- `sum` is the sum of \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) for each iteration where \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \), otherwise the sum is the sum of \( i \times n \) for those iterations.

Since the loop head only involves `j` and `n + r + 1`, we need to ensure these are correctly set.

**State:**
- `j` is 1.
- `n + r + 1` is the value derived from the condition \( r \) being the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`j` is 1, `n + r + 1` is the value derived from the condition \( r \) being the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}`**.
