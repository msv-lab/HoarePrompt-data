Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 3, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code updates the `sum` variable by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `sum`, it remains unspecified, but it is now updated by the expression `n * (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables `i` and `r` remain unchanged.
