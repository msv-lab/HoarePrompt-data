Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `sum` is equal to either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or increased by `i * n`, depending on whether `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true.
- `n` and `i` are integers.
- `r` is equal to `i` if the if condition is met.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `n + 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
2. **Variable `n`**: The value of `n` does not change within the loop; it remains the same as the initial value.
3. **Variable `sum`**: The value of `sum` is updated based on the condition inside the loop. However, since we are only asked to adjust the state at the start of the next iteration, we don't need to consider the exact value of `sum` unless it directly affects the loop continuation, which it doesn't in this case.
4. **Variable `r`**: The value of `r` is set to `i` if the condition inside the loop is met. Since we don't know the exact condition or its result from the given information, we can't determine the exact value of `r` at the start of the next iteration.

### Adjusting the State
Given the loop head, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

- **`i`**: It will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- **`n`**: It remains unchanged.

### Updated State
At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`sum` is equal to either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or increased by `(i + 1) * n`, depending on whether `n * (n + 1) // 2 > (i + 1) * n` holds true. `n` and `i` are integers, and `r` is equal to `i + 1` if the if condition is met.**
