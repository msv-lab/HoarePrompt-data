To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is 3.
   - `n + r + 1` is the value derived from the condition where \( r \) is the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Understanding \( r \):**
   - We need to find the largest integer \( r \) such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).
   - This inequality can be rewritten as \( r < \frac{n + 1}{2} \).
   - Therefore, \( r \) is the largest integer less than \( \frac{n + 1}{2} \), which is \( \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor \).

3. **Expression for \( n + r + 1 \):**
   - Substituting \( r = \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor \) into \( n + r + 1 \):
     \[
     n + r + 1 = n + \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]

4. **Determining \( n \):**
   - Since \( j \) is 3 and there is no direct relationship between \( j \) and \( n \) in the given conditions, we need to infer \( n \) from the context.
   - Given the expression \( n + r + 1 \), if we assume \( n \) is a positive integer, we can test small values to see if they fit the pattern.
   - Let's try \( n = 2 \):
     \[
     r = \left\lfloor \frac{2 + 1}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.5 \right\rfloor = 1
     \]
     \[
     n + r + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4
     \]
   - This fits the form of the expression. So, \( n = 2 \).

5. **Range Calculation:**
   - The code snippet is `print(*range(1, n + 1))`.
   - With \( n = 2 \):
     \[
     \text{range}(1, n + 1) = \text{range}(1, 3) = [1, 2]
     \]

6. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the elements of the range in a single line separated by spaces.
   - Therefore, it will print: `1 2`.

Output: **1 2**
