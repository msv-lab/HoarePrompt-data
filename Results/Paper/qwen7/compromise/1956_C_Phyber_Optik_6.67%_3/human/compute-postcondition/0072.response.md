Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `sum` is `i * n` which equals `3 * n`.**

The code updates the `sum` variable by adding the product of `i` (which is 3) and `n` to it. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `sum` becomes `3 * n`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
