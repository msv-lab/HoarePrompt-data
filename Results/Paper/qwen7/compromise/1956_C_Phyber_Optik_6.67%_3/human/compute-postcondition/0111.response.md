Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n` (inclusive), meaning `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n`.

3. **Determine the New Value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the start of the first iteration, `i` is `1`. After the first iteration, `i` becomes `2`, and so on. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by `1` from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Determine the New Value of `n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged within the loop; it is only initialized before the loop starts.

5. **Adjust the States**: Given that `i` is incremented by `1` and `n` remains the same, we need to update `i` to its new value while keeping `n` the same.

6. **Postconditions**: The postconditions provided do not change based on the loop iteration itself but rather depend on the values of `i` and `n`. However, since we are focusing on the loop head variables, we only need to update `i`.

Based on these steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be incremented by `1`.
- `n` remains the same.

Given the initial conditions:
- `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n`.
- `j` is `n + 1`.
- `n` is at least `1`.
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of remaining iterations.
- `r` is either `i` or `0` depending on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n`, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least `1`, `t` is an input integer representing the number of remaining iterations, `r` is either `i` or `0` depending on whether the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true or false, `i` is `i + 1**.
