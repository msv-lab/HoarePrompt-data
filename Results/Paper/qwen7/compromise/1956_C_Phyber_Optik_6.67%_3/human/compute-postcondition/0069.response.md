Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 1
   - If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `2 * n`, then `sum` is set to `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `sum` is set to `2 * n`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - Therefore, in the next iteration, `i` will be 3.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will continue if `i` is less than `n + 1`.

5. **States to Adjust:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - We need to update `i` to 3 for the next iteration.

6. **Additional Considerations:**
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.
   - The value of `sum` is determined by the condition at the end of the loop, but it does not affect the loop itself.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is `i` to 3.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1**
