Output State: **`j` is \( n + r + 1 \), `n` is an input integer, the number of remaining iterations is \( t - 1 \)**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The initial value of `j` is defined as \( n + r + 1 \), where \( r \) is the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \). This calculation does not change because the code only updates `n`, leaving `j` and `r` unchanged. The number of remaining iterations remains \( t - 1 \).
