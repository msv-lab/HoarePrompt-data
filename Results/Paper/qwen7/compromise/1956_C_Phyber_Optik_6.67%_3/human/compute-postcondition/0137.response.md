Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `r` is an integer.
- `n + r + 1` is a positive integer, which means `n + r` must be at least 0 (since adding 1 makes it positive).
- `j` is updated to `j + 1`, but the initial value of `j` is not specified.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `2` is a constant integer.
- `j % n` computes the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.

Since `j` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only say that after `j` is incremented by 1, `j % n` will be the remainder of `j` divided by `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2 [remainder of j divided by n]**
