Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic implemented in the `func` function matches the problem statement and the provided example.

### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Calculation of Sum of Friendship Values (`sum_f`)**:
   - The program correctly sums up the friendship values for all given pairs.
   
2. **Combinatorial Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose any two children from `n` children, which is \( \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \).
   - This part is correctly implemented as `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The formula used in the program is \( p = 2 \times k \times cn2 \times sum_f + m \times k \times (k - 1) \).
   - The denominator \( q = 2 \times cn2^2 \).

4. **GCD Simplification**:
   - The program correctly simplifies the fraction using the greatest common divisor (gcd).

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The final result is computed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), which is correctly handled.

### Verification Against Example:
Let's verify the example provided in the problem statement:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: 
  ```
  100 0 24
  ```
- Output: 
  ```
  0
  ```
- Explanation: No pairs of friends, so the sum of friendship values is 0 for all excursions.

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: 
  ```
  2 1 1
  1 2 1
  ```
- Output: 
  ```
  55
  ```
- Explanation: There is only one pair (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1. Each excursion increases the friendship value by 1, so after 10 excursions, the sum is \( 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 10 = 55 \).

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: 
  ```
  5 2 4
  1 2 25
  3 2 24
  ```
- Output: 
  ```
  777777784
  ```
- Explanation: The final answer is \(\frac{7}{9}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Implementation Check:
The implementation in the program seems to match the steps outlined above. The logic for calculating the expected value and simplifying the fraction is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided execution summary and the verification against the examples, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
