Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for j in range(m)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `b` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `f` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f + f` (This indicates that `sum_f` accumulates the value of `f` over iterations).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < m`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is some integer value, let's call it `j_prev`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `j_prev + 1`.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the state**:
   - Since `sum_f` is updated in each iteration but not directly related to the loop head, its state does not need to be adjusted here.
   - The values of `a`, `b`, and `f` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f + f`, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `j_prev + 1`**.

However, since we only need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, the final answer is:

State: **`j` is `j_prev + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `j_prev + 1`**.
