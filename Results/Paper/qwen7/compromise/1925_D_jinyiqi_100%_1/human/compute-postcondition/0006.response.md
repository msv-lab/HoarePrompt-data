Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `sum_f` is 0, `j` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `m` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation: The code `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and splits them by spaces, assigning them to `a`, `b`, and `f`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `j`, and the condition on `m`) remain unchanged.
