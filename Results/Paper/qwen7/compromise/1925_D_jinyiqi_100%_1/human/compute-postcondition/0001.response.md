Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50000, M is 1000000007.**

Explanation: The code initializes a constant `M` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`. This does not affect the value of `t`, which was previously set to an integer input between 1 and 50000. Therefore, the only new information is the value of `M`.
