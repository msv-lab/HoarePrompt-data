Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `m`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j < m`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is an integer from the input.
   - `b` is an integer from the input.
   - `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f + f`.
   - `f` is an integer from the input.
   - `j` is `j_prev + 1`.
   - `m` is the same as it was before.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value (`j_prev + 1`), so `j` becomes `j_prev + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must still be less than `m`.

Given these points, we can summarize the updated state for the next iteration:

State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f + f`, `f` is an integer from the input, `j` is `j_prev + 2`, `m` is the same as it was before**
