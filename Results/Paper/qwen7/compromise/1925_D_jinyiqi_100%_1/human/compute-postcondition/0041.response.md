Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`; `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is -1, `sum_f` is the total sum of all integers `f` entered by the user, `p` is `p // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)**

Explanation: The code `p = p // gcd` divides `p` by `gcd`. Since `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `p` is updated to its value divided by `gcd`. The other variables remain unchanged.
