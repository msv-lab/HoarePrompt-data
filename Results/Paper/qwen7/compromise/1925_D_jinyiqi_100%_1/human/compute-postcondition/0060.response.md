Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`; `q` is equal to 2 * `cn2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q` using the `math.gcd` function. The value of `q` remains unchanged and is still equal to `2 * cn2`. The GCD of `p` and `q` is stored in the variable `gcd`.
