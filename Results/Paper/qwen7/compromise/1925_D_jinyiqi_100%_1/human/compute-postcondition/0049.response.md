Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `sum_f` is equal to `f` since `sum_f` was not initialized before and `f` is an integer from the input.**

The code `sum_f += f` increments `sum_f` by the value of `f`. Since `sum_f` was not initialized before this line, its initial value is 0. Therefore, after executing this line, `sum_f` will be equal to `f`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
