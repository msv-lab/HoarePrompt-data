Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `t > 0`: This is a condition but does not affect the calculation directly.
   - `i = 0`: Initial value of `i`.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `m` is an integer.
   - `k` is an integer.
   - `j = m - 1`: Since `j` is derived from `m`, it is also an integer.
   - `a` is an integer.
   - `b` is an integer.
   - `f` is an integer (the value of `f` is not specified, but it will be summed up).
   - `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values over `m` iterations.
   - `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`: This is the number of combinations of `n` items taken 2 at a time.
   - `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) // gcd`: Here, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
   - `q = 2 * cn2`: This is twice the number of combinations of `n` items taken 2 at a time.
   - `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
   - `p` and `q` are then updated to their respective values divided by `gcd`.

2. **Code to Analyze:**
   ```python
   print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))
   ```

Given the formulae and the operations, let's simplify the expression inside the `print` function:

- `p` is defined as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) // gcd`.
- `q` is defined as `2 * cn2`.
- Both `p` and `q` are then divided by `gcd`.

So, the expression inside the `print` function simplifies to:
\[ \text{int}\left(\frac{p}{\text{gcd}} \cdot \left(\frac{\text{q}}{\text{gcd}}\right)^{-1} \mod M\right) \]

Since `q` is `2 * cn2` and both `p` and `q` are divided by `gcd`, the term \(\left(\frac{\text{q}}{\text{gcd}}\right)^{-1}\) simplifies to \(\frac{\text{gcd}}{2 \cdot \text{cn2}}\).

Therefore, the expression further simplifies to:
\[ \text{int}\left(\frac{p}{\text{gcd}} \cdot \frac{\text{gcd}}{2 \cdot \text{cn2}} \mod M\right) = \text{int}\left(\frac{p}{2 \cdot \text{cn2}} \mod M\right) \]

Given that `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, the term \(\frac{p}{2 \cdot \text{cn2}}\) simplifies to:
\[ k \cdot \text{sum_f} + \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \text{cn2}} \]

Since \(\frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \text{cn2}}\) is an integer (as it is derived from the combination formula), the expression further simplifies to:
\[ k \cdot \text{sum_f} \mod M \]

Thus, the final output is:
Output: **k * sum_f % M**
