Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(m)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `b` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `f` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f + f`.
   - `j` is `j + 1`.
   - `m` is the same as before.
   - `a` is updated to the first integer entered by the user.
   - `b` is updated to the second integer entered by the user.
   - `f` is updated to the third integer entered by the user.

3. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `j` and `m`, we need to ensure that `j < m` for the loop to continue.
   - From the given information, `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, and it was `j + 1` in the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, if `j` was `j + 1` in the previous iteration, then `j` is now `j + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `j` is `j + 2` and `j < m`.

**Final State**:
State: **`a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f + f`, `j` is `j + 2`, `m` is the same as before**.
