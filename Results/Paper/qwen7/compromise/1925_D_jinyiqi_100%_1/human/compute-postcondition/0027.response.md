Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `f` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into three parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. Since the exact values entered by the user are not specified, we can only state that these variables now hold integers. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
