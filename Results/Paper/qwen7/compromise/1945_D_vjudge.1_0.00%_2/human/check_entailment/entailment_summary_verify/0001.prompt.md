You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
    print(resultado)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes multiple test cases, executing `func_1()` for each one. It reads the number of test cases (`numero_testes`) from input, then for each test case, it calls `func_1()`. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results of `func_1()` for each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves determining the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue.
   - Kirill can swap positions with anyone in front of him, paying `a_j` coins for the initial swap and `b_k` coins for each subsequent swap between `j` and `k`.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes input parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is the total number of people in the queue (excluding Kirill), and `k` is the maximum allowable final position for Kirill.
   - It reads two lists of integers, `lista_A` and `lista_B`, which represent the costs `a_i` and `b_i` for each person in the queue.
   - The function reverses these lists, which is unnecessary since the original order is used in the logic.
   - It initializes `soma_b` to 0 and `pref` to 0.
   - It iterates through the first `n-k` elements of the reversed lists:
     - If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, it updates `pref` by adding `soma_b` and `lista_A[i]`, setting `soma_b` to 0.
     - Otherwise, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
   - It then iterates through the last `k` elements of the reversed lists:
     - For each element, it calculates the minimum cost by adding `pref`, `soma_b`, and `lista_A[i]`.
     - It updates `soma_b` by adding `lista_B[i]`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum cost.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly computes the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions.
   - The reversal of the lists is unnecessary and does not affect the correctness of the algorithm.
   - The approach of iterating through the first `n-k` elements and then the last `k` elements ensures that all necessary swaps are considered.
   - The use of `pref` and `soma_b` correctly accumulates the costs as required.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the solution to the problem.
   - The function `func_2` correctly calls `func_1` for each test case.
