Output State: `soma_b` is 0, `n` is the same integer as initially, `k` is the same integer as initially, `lista_A` is the reversed version of the list of n integers obtained from the third space-separated input, `lista_B` is the reverse of the list of integers obtained from the fourth space-separated input, `pref` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to `n-1`, where each element is added only if its corresponding element in `lista_A` is less than the element in `lista_B`.
