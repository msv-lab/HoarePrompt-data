Output State: `soma_b` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lista_A` is a list of integers, `lista_B` is a list of integers, `pref` is the sum of `pref` plus `soma_b` for each index `i` where `i` is less than `n - k` and `lista_A[i]` is less than `lista_B[i]`, plus `lista_A[i]`, and `soma_b` is the sum of `soma_b` and `lista_B[i]` for each index `i` where `i` is less than `n - k` and `lista_A[i]` is greater than or equal to `lista_B[i]`.
