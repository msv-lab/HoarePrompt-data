Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `vals` is a list of values.
   - `den` is initially set to the result of successively applying `func_1` to the first element of `vals` and each subsequent element in `vals`.
   - For each element in `vals`, `vprod` is calculated as `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - After calculating `vprod`, `den` is updated to `den - sum(vprod)`, and it is guaranteed that `den` remains greater than 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of dividing `den` by the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - The `print` statement joins all elements of `vprod` into a single string with spaces between them and converts each element to a string.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `den` is initially set to the result of successively applying `func_1` to the elements of `vals`, and then adjusted by subtracting the sum of `vprod`, the exact numerical values of `den` and `vprod` depend on the specific implementation of `func_1` and the values in `vals`.
   - However, the exact numerical values are not needed to determine the format of the output.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be a space-separated string of the elements in `vprod`, each converted to a string.

Given the above analysis, the output will be a space-separated string of the elements in `vprod`.

Output: **a space-separated string of the elements in vprod**
