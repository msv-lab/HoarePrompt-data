Postcondition: **`vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `den` divided by each corresponding element in `vals`, and `den` is the result of successively applying `func_1` to the first element of `vals` and each subsequent element in `vals`; `den` is updated to `den - sum(vprod)`. The value of `den` is less than or equal to 0**.
