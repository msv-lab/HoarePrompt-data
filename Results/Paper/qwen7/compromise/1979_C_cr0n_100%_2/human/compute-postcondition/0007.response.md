Output State: **`vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `den` divided by each corresponding element in `vals`, and `den` is the result of successively applying `func_1` to the first element of `vals` and each subsequent element in `vals`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `vprod` where each element is calculated as `den` (which is the result of successively applying `func_1` to the elements of `vals`) divided by each corresponding element in `vals`. The values of `den` and `vals` remain unchanged from their initial state, but `vprod` is updated based on these values.
