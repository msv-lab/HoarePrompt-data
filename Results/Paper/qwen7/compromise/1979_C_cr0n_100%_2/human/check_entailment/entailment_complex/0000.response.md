### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This involves finding a distribution of coins \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \) for all \(i\).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - Specifically, it returns \( \frac{a \times b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \).
   - Given the constraints \(2 \leq b \leq 20\) and \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), this function correctly computes the LCM.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function processes the input for each test case.
   - It reads the number of outcomes \(N\) and the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_N\).
   - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier \(k_1\).
   - It iteratively applies `func_1` to update `den` with each subsequent multiplier.
   - It then calculates `vprod` as \(\left[\frac{\text{den}}{r} \mid r \in \text{vals}\right]\).
   - It updates `den` by subtracting the sum of `vprod`.
   - If `den` is non-positive, it prints `-1` and returns.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function correctly computes the LCM of the multipliers.
   - The logic for distributing the coins ensures that the total bet is less than the potential winnings for each outcome.
   - The final check (`den > 0`) ensures that the total bet is indeed less than the potential winnings.

Given the analysis, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
