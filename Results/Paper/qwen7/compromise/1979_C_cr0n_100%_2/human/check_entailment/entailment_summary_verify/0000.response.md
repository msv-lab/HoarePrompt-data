### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to understand its behavior and correctness.

#### Function 2 Analysis:
- The function `func_2` reads the number of outcomes \(N\) and a list of multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_N\).
- It calculates a common denominator `den` using the `func_1` function, which computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.
- It then computes a list `vprod` where each element is `den` divided by each corresponding element in the original list.
- It updates `den` by subtracting the sum of `vprod`.
- If `den` becomes less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1` and returns.
- Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string and returns `None`.

#### Problem Requirements:
- We need to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

#### Test Case Analysis:
- Consider the test case:
  ```
  5
  5 5 5 5 5
  ```

  - The function calculates `den` as the LCM of 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, which is 5.
  - `vprod` is calculated as `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
  - `den` is updated to `5 - (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 0`.
  - Since `den` is 0, it prints `-1`.

This test case is handled correctly by the program, as it correctly identifies that no valid distribution exists.

#### General Case Analysis:
- For any set of multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_N\), the program calculates the LCM of these multipliers to find a common denominator.
- It then distributes the coins evenly based on this common denominator.
- The key point is that the program ensures the total bet amount is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome by checking if `den` becomes non-positive after updating.

Given the function summary and the analysis of the test cases, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It ensures that the total bet amount is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome by leveraging the properties of the LCM and the subsequent subtraction of the sum of the distributed amounts.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct as it meets the problem requirements and handles all potential cases appropriately.
