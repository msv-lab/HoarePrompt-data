### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program implements the necessary logic to solve the problem. However, let's break down the steps in detail to ensure the correctness of the program.

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.

2. **Function `func_1(a, b)` Analysis:**
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula: \(\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}\).
   - This is correct and essential for finding the LCM of all multipliers.

3. **Function `func_2()` Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - Reads the number of outcomes \( N \) and the multipliers \( k_i \).
   - **LCM Calculation:**
     - Initializes `den` with the first multiplier \( k_1 \).
     - Iteratively applies `func_1` to update `den` with the LCM of `den` and each subsequent multiplier.
   - **Bet Amount Calculation:**
     - Computes `vprod` where each element is \( \frac{\text{den}}{k_i} \).
   - **Validation:**
     - Updates `den` by subtracting the sum of `vprod`.
     - Checks if `den` is positive. If not, prints `-1`.
     - If `den` is positive, prints the bet amounts.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The LCM calculation ensures that the total bet is a common multiple of all multipliers.
   - Dividing the LCM by each multiplier gives feasible bet amounts.
   - Subtracting the sum of these bet amounts from the LCM ensures the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each outcome.

### Detailed Validation

- **LCM Calculation:**
  - The LCM of all multipliers ensures that the total bet can be evenly divided by each multiplier.
  - This is crucial because it guarantees that the total bet is a feasible amount for each outcome.

- **Bet Amount Calculation:**
  - Each bet amount \( x_i \) is calculated as \( \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i} \).
  - This ensures that the total bet \( \sum x_i \) is a multiple of each \( k_i \).

- **Validation:**
  - Checking if the remaining value (LCM minus the sum of bet amounts) is positive ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each outcome.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. The logic and calculations are sound, and the validation step ensures the required condition is met.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
