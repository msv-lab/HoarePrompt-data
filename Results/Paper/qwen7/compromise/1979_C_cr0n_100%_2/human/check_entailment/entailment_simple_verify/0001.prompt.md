You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires distributing coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. 

### Provided Code Analysis
The provided code includes two functions:

1. **func_1(a, b):**
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
   - It uses the formula: \(\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}\).

2. **func_2():**
   - This function processes the input for a single test case.
   - It reads the number of outcomes \( N \) and the multipliers \( k_i \).
   - It computes the least common multiple (LCM) of all multipliers.
   - It then divides this LCM by each multiplier to get the required bet amounts.
   - Finally, it checks if the remaining value (after subtracting the sum of these bet amounts from the LCM) is positive. If not, it prints `-1`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Understanding the LCM Calculation:**
   - The LCM of all multipliers \( k_i \) ensures that the bet amounts are such that the total bet is a common multiple of all multipliers.
   - This helps in ensuring that the total bet is a feasible amount that can be evenly divided by each \( k_i \).

2. **Bet Amount Calculation:**
   - For each multiplier \( k_i \), the bet amount \( x_i \) is calculated as \( \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i} \).
   - This ensures that the total bet \( \sum x_i \) is a multiple of each \( k_i \).

3. **Validation:**
   - After calculating the bet amounts, the code checks if the remaining value (LCM minus the sum of bet amounts) is positive.
   - If the remaining value is non-positive, it means the total bet is not strictly less than the amount received back for any outcome, hence printing `-1`.

### Correctness Check
- The logic in `func_2()` correctly implements the requirement to find a distribution of coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each outcome.
- The use of LCM ensures that the bet amounts are feasible and can be evenly divided by each multiplier.
- The validation step ensures that the condition is met.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
