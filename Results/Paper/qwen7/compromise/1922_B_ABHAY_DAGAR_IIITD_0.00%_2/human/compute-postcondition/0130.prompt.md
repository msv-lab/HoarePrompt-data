Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is the sum of all values calculated according to the conditions within the loop for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` and the new `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` and the new `num_of_lens`, and `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`. `n` is an input integer, and `num_list` is updated with integers from the input split and mapped to integers.
Code of the loop:
for x in num_list:
    if x in num_of_lens:
        num_of_lens[x] += 1
    else:
        num_of_lens[x] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key `x` from `num_list` has a corresponding value representing the count of occurrences of `x`. `res` is the sum of all values calculated according to the conditions within the loop for each `x` in `num_list` and the new `num_list`. `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` and the new `num_of_lens`. `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers updated with integers from the input split and mapped to integers, and `x` is the first element in `num_list`. If `x` is already in `num_of_lens`, its count is incremented by 1; otherwise, a new entry with key `x` and value 1 is added to `num_of_lens`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is either incremented by 1 if it already exists, or added with a value of 1 if it does not exist. `res` remains unchanged, `total_count` remains unchanged, `results` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers updated with integers from the input split and mapped to integers (excluding the first element), and `x` is the second element in the updated `num_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1 if `x` already exists in `num_of_lens`; otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1. `res`, `total_count`, `results`, `n`, and `num_list` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
