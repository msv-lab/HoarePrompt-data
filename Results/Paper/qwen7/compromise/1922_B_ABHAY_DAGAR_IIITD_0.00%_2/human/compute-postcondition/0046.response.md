Output State: **`total_count` is increased by the new `cnt`, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, and `res` is updated to `res` + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `cnt` is used directly in the calculation, and the updated value of `res` reflects this change.
