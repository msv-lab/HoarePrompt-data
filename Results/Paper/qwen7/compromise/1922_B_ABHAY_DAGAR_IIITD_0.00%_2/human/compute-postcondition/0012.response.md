Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the first element in `num_list`) either has its value incremented by 1 or is set to 1, depending on whether `x` is already in `num_of_lens`. `x` is the first element in `num_list`.**
