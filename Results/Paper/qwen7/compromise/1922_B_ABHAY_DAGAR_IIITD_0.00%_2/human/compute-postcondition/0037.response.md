Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are values in `num_of_lens`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total_count` is increased by `cnt`.
   - `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair.
   - `res` remains 0 if `cnt` is less than 2. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is set to `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6.

4. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the values of `num_of_lens`, the only variable that changes within the loop is `cnt`.
   - After each iteration, `cnt` is taken from `num_of_lens` and used in the loop body.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `num_of_lens` must still contain at least one key-value pair.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `total_count` is increased by `cnt`.
   - `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair (to ensure the loop continues).
   - `res` remains 0 if `cnt` is less than 2. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is set to `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6.

Given that `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair for the loop to continue, and assuming it does, the only change is in `cnt` which will be the next value from `num_of_lens`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total_count` is increased by `cnt`, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, and `res` remains 0 if `cnt` is less than 2. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is set to `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6.**
