Output State: **`num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `res` is the sum of all values calculated according to the conditions within the loop for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` and the new `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` and the new `num_of_lens`, and `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`. `n` is an input integer, and `num_list` is updated with integers from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and then maps each string to an integer, creating a new list `num_list`. The initial state variables (`num_of_lens`, `res`, `total_count`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and values, but `num_list` is now updated with the new integer values from the input.
