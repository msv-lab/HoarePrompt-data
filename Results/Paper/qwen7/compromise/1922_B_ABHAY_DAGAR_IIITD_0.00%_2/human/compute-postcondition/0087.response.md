Output State: **`num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`**.

This means that the value of `num_of_lens` stays the same, `cnt` remains greater than or equal to 2, and `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its previous value of `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.
