Output State: **All keys in `num_of_lens` have their corresponding values summed up and processed through the given formulas, and `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`. `res` contains the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions.**

In more detail:
- `total_count` will be the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`.
- For each value `cnt` in `num_of_lens`:
  - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` will include `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.
  - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` will also include `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` will remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop, with no further changes.
