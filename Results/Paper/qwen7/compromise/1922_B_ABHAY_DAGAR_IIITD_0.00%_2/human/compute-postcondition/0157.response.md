Postcondition: `total_count` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` plus `cnt_next`, and `res` is updated according to the following rules:
- If `cnt_next` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated by adding `cnt_next * (cnt_next - 1) * (cnt_next - 2) // 6` to its current value.
- If `cnt_next` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated by adding `cnt_next * (cnt_next - 1) * total_count // 2` to its current value.
- If `cnt_next` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.
