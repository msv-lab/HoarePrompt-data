State: **`total_count` is 0, `cnt` is the first value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `num_of_lens` must have at least one value**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `cnt` and `num_of_lens`.
2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `num_of_lens.values()` provides at least one value. This means `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair.
3. **Adjust States**: 
   - `total_count` is given as 0 and does not affect the loop's execution directly.
   - `cnt` will take the value of the first element from `num_of_lens.values()` when the loop starts.
   - `num_of_lens` must have at least one value for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
