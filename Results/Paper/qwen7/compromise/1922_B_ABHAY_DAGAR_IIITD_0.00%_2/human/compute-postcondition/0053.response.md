Output State: **`num_of_lens` is processed as before, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, `res` contains the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions, and `results` now includes the current value of `res`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(res)` adds the current value of `res` to the list `results`. Since `res` contains the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions, appending it to `results` simply adds this cumulative result to the list. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `total_count`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
