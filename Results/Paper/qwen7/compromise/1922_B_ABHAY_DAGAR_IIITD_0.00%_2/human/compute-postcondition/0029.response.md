Output State: **`total_count` is 0, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, `res` is `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6, and the current count (`cnt`) is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is updated by adding the value of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its current value. Since `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` evaluates to a specific integer value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
