Output State: **`results` is a list containing all the elements from each iteration of the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all values from `num_of_lens.values()` for every iteration, `res` is the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions across all iterations, and `result` is the last element in the list `results` after the loop has executed all its iterations.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the `results` list will contain one element for each iteration, capturing the value of `res` at the end of each iteration. The `total_count` will reflect the accumulated sum of all values from `num_of_lens.values()` across all iterations, and `res` will hold the final cumulative result after applying the formulas to all qualifying values in `num_of_lens` throughout the entire loop execution.
