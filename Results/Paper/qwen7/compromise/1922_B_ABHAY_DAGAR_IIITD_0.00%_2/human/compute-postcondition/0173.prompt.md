You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two elements: an integer n representing the number of sticks, and a list of integers a where each a_i represents the exponent used to calculate the length of the i-th stick as 2^{a_i}.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        num_of_lens = {}
        
        for x in num_list:
            if x in num_of_lens:
                num_of_lens[x] += 1
            else:
                num_of_lens[x] = 1
        
        res = 0
        
        total_count = 0
        
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
            if cnt >= 2:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
            total_count += cnt
        
        results.append(res)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `total_count` will be the sum of all values from `num_of_lens.values()` for every iteration. The variable `res` will contain the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions across all iterations. The list `results` will contain the value of `res` after each iteration of the loop.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing all the elements from each iteration of the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all values from `num_of_lens.values()` for every iteration, `res` is the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions across all iterations, and `result` is the last element in the list `results` after the loop has executed all its iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. The function returns a list of stick lengths calculated as \(2^{a_i}\) for each stick.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
