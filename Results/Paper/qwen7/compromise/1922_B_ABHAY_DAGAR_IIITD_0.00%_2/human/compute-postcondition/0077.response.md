Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `num_of_lens` will be a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from `num_list` and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears in `num_list`. `total_count` will be the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`. `res` will contain the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in the original `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions (though no specific condition or formula was provided, we assume it remains unchanged as no operation on `res` was mentioned). `test_cases` will be decremented by the length of `num_list` and must be greater than 0. `results` will include the final value of `res` after the loop completes. `num_list` will be a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, and `x` will be the last element of `num_list` processed by the loop.

In summary, `num_of_lens` will represent the frequency distribution of the integers in `num_list`, and all other variables will reflect the state after processing all elements in `num_list`.
