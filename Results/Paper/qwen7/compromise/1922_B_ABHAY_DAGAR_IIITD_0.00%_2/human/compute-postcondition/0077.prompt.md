Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `total_count` is the sum of all values in the original `num_of_lens`, `res` contains the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in the original `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions, `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` now includes the current value of `res`, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for x in num_list:
    if x in num_of_lens:
        num_of_lens[x] += 1
    else:
        num_of_lens[x] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary, `total_count` is the sum of all values in the original `num_of_lens`, `res` contains the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in the original `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions, `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` now includes the current value of `res`, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, `x` is the first element of `num_list`. If `x` is already in `num_of_lens`, `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, a new entry `{x: 1}` is added to `num_of_lens`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, `res`, `test_cases`, `results`, `num_list`, and `x` retain their properties as described in the precondition. If `x` is found in `num_of_lens`, `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, and `test_cases` is decremented by 1. If `x` is not found in `num_of_lens`, `num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1, and `test_cases` is also decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `num_of_lens` and `test_cases` are updated. If `x` is in `num_of_lens`, then `num_of_lens[5]` is incremented by 1 and `test_cases` is decremented by 1. If `x` is not in `num_of_lens`, then `num_of_lens[5]` is set to 2 and `test_cases` is decremented by 1, while `total_count`, `res`, `results`, and `num_list` retain their original properties.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
