Output State: **`res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * total_count // 2` to its current value, and `total_count` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**.

Explanation: The code updates `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * total_count // 2` to its current value. Since `cnt` and `total_count` are already defined in the initial state, their values remain unchanged. The only change is the addition to `res`. The condition for updating `res` based on `cnt` being greater than or equal to 3 is not relevant here because the code does not check the value of `cnt` before performing the addition. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `res` and the unchanged state of `total_count`.
