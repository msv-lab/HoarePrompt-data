Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `x` which is iterating over `num_list`.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - `num_list`: Since `x` is the first element of `num_list`, it will be removed from `num_list` as it is processed in each iteration.
   - `x`: This variable will take the next element from `num_list` in the next iteration.
   - `num_of_lens`: Depending on whether `x` is already in `num_of_lens`, either `num_of_lens[x]` will be incremented by 1 or a new entry `{x: 1}` will be added.

3. **Adjust the postconditions**:
   - `total_count`: This will remain unchanged as the total count is derived from the initial state and does not change within the loop.
   - `res`: This will be updated based on the formula applied to the current `x`, but the exact value cannot be determined without knowing the loop body.
   - `test_cases`: This will be decremented by 1, but since it must be greater than 0, it will still be greater than 0.
   - `results`: This will include the current value of `res` after processing the current `x`.
   - `num_list`: It will lose its first element `x` and become a list of the remaining elements.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `x` will be the second element of `num_list`.
- `num_list` will be the list of elements from `num_list` excluding the first element (i.e., `x`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary, `total_count` is the sum of all values in the original `num_of_lens`, `res` contains the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in the original `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions, `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` now includes the current value of `res`, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, `x` is the second element of `num_list`.**
