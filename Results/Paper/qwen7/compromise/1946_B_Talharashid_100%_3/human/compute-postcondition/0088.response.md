Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and 0; `c` is increased by `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.**

Explanation: The code updates `maxi` to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`. Initially, `maxi` is defined as the maximum of `c + ele` and 0. After executing the line `maxi = max(c, maxi)`, `maxi` is now the maximum of `c` and its previous value. The value of `c` is increased by `ele`.
