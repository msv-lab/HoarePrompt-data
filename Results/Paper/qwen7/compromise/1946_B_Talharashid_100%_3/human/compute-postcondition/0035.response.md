Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` holds the maximum sum of contiguous subarray elements in the list `l` that meets the condition specified in the loop, `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and any individual element in `l` that is less than `0` and whose absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `l`. The values of `n`, `k`, `c`, `maxi`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 due to the given initial state.
