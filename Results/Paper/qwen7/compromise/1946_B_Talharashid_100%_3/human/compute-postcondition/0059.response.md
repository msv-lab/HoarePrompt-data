Postcondition: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is updated as follows: if `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is set to 0; otherwise, `c` is updated by adding `ele` to its current value, and `maxi` is now the maximum of the new `c` and `maxi`. `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.**
