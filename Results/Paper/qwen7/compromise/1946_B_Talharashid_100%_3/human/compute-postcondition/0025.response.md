Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `ele` is the third element of `l`, `c` is the sum of the previous value of `c` and the third element of `l`, and `maxi` is the maximum between the previous value of `c` and the third element of `l`.**

Explanation: The code `c += ele` increments the value of `c` by the value of `ele`, which is the third element of the list `l`. The value of `maxi` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. The other variables remain in their initial state or are updated according to the given conditions.
