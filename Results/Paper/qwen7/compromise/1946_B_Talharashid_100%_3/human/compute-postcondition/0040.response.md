Output State: **`maxi` is max(0, c), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least one element, the current value of `ele` is less than 0, and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.**

Explanation: The line `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum between `c` (which is 0) and the current value of `maxi` (which is also 0). Since both values are the same, `maxi` remains 0. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
