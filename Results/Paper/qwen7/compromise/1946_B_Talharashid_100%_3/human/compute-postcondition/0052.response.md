Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is updated by adding `ele` to its current value, `i` is incremented by 1 (now `i` is `i_val + 1`), `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least one element left, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.**

Explanation: The code updates `maxi` to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`. Since `c` is updated by adding `ele` to its current value and `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `c` now holds the new value. `maxi` is then updated to reflect the maximum between the new value of `c` and the original `maxi`. All other variables remain unchanged.
