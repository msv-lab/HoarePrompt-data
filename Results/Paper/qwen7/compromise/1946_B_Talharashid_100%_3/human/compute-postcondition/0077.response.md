Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ele in l:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `ele` and `l`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - `ele` is the current element being processed in the list `l`.
   - `l` is the list of integers.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and `0`.
   - `i` is the first input integer.
   - `n` is the first input integer.
   - `k` is the second input integer.
   - `c` is `c + ele`.
   - `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `ele` is the first element of `l`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ele` is the first element of `l` in the current iteration, for the next iteration, `ele` will be the second element of `l`.
   - `l` must still have at least one element (since it must have at least one element for the loop to start).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `maxi` remains the same because it is based on the previous `c + ele` and `0`.
   - `i` remains the first input integer.
   - `n` remains the first input integer.
   - `k` remains the second input integer.
   - `c` remains `c + ele` from the previous iteration.
   - `l` must now be a list of integers with at least two elements (since the second element is about to be processed).
   - `ele` is now the second element of `l`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and `0`, `i` is the first input integer, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `c` is `c + ele`, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `ele` is the second element of `l`**.
