Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `ele`, `i`, and `l`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `ele` in the list `l`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `c` is updated based on the value of `ele`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, it means the loop has processed one more element from the list `l`.
   - `l` must still have at least one element left for the loop to continue.
   - `ele` will be the next element in the list `l`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `l` must have at least one element left.
   - `ele` will be the next element in the list `l`.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `l` must have at least one element left.
- `ele` will be the next element in the list `l`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is updated based on the value of `ele`, `i` is incremented by 1 (let's say `i` was previously `i_val`, now `i` is `i_val + 1`), `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least one element left, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`**.
