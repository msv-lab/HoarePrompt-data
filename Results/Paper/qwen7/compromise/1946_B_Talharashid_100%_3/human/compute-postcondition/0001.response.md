Output State: **`n` is the first integer entered, `k` is the second integer entered, both integers are at least 1**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. Since the initial state mentions that `int(input())` must be at least 1, it implies that both `n` and `k` must be at least 1. The input is split into two parts, converting each part to an integer. Therefore, `n` and `k` are now specific integers that are at least 1, and no other variables are affected.
