Output State: **`maxi` is 0, `i` is the first input integer, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `c` is `c + ele`, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `ele` is the first element of `l`, and `ele` is greater than or equal to 0 or `c` is greater than `abs(ele)`**.

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`, which is the first element of the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
