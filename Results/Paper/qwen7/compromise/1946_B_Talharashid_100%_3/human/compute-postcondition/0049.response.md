Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is updated based on the value of `ele`, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least one element left, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.**

Explanation: The code updates `maxi` to be the maximum of `c` and the current value of `maxi`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
