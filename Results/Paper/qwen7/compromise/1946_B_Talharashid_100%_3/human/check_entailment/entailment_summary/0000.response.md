Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
2. **Key Insight**: The key insight is that the optimal strategy often involves using the largest positive sums and potentially inserting them multiple times through the operations. However, the provided code does not correctly implement this logic.
3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code attempts to find the maximum prefix sum (`maxi`) in the array `l`.
   - It then incorrectly calculates the result using the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.
   - This formula does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements and does not account for the correct way to maximize the sum after `k` operations.
4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the sum, we should consider the sum of the array and how we can use the operations to increase this sum.
   - The correct approach would involve calculating the sum of the array and understanding how the operations can be used to enhance this sum, possibly by inserting larger positive values multiple times.

Given the provided code and the execution summary, the code does not correctly solve the problem. The formula used in the code does not align with the problem's requirements and does not account for the optimal way to use the operations to maximize the sum.

Correctness: **False**
