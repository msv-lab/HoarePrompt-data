Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.
3. It initializes a list `v` of length `n+1` where the first element is 0 and the rest are the indices of the best friends.
4. The program checks if there exists any pair of friends `(i, v[i])` such that `v[v[i]] == i`. If such a pair is found, it means these two friends can be invited, and only 2 invitations are needed. In this case, it prints `2` and returns immediately.
5. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`, which is the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party based on the problem statement.

However, there are a couple of issues in the implementation:
- The line `v = [0] * (n + 1)` and `v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` are redundant because the list `v` is being reinitialized twice.
- The function `func_1()` should properly handle the logic to find the minimum number of invitations required.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v = [0] + v  # Initialize v with 0 as the first element
    pairs = []
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            pairs.append(i)
    
    if len(pairs) >= 2:
        print(2)
    else:
        print(3)
```

With these corrections, the function should work as intended.

Correctness: **False**
