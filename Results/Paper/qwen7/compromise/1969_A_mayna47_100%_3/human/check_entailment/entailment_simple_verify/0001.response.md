### Reasoning

The original assessment identified a critical issue: the function `func_1()` is not being called for each test case. This is a significant flaw because the logic inside `func_1()` is necessary to solve the problem correctly. Let's break down the issues and verify the corrected version:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined and should be called for each test case.

3. **Function Implementation:**
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program initializes a list `v` with zeros.
   - It updates `v` with the values from the input list of best friends.
   - It then iterates through the list to check if there are any pairs where `v[v[i]] == i`. If such a pair exists, it prints `2` and returns, indicating that sending invitations to just these two friends is sufficient.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`, indicating that at least three friends need to be invited.

### Issues Identified:
- The function `func_1()` is not being called for each test case. This is a significant issue because the logic inside `func_1()` is necessary to determine the minimum number of invitations required.

### Corrected Program:
The corrected version of the program calls `func_1()` for each test case, ensuring that the logic inside `func_1()` is executed for each test case.

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
    print(3)
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate in identifying that the function `func_1()` is not being called for each test case. The corrected version ensures that `func_1()` is called for each test case, which is necessary to solve the problem correctly.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
