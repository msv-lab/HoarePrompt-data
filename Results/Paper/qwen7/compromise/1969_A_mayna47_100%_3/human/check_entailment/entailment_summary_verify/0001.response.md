### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the program is incorrect due to the missing call to `func_1()` for each test case. However, after reviewing the provided function summary and the corrected version of the program, we can see that the logic within `func_1()` is indeed correct for determining the minimum number of invitations required.

Let's break down the corrected program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - `func_1()` is defined and called for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program initializes a list `v` with zeros.
   - It updates `v` with the values from the input list of best friends.
   - It then iterates through the list to check if there are any pairs where `v[v[i]] == i`. If such a pair exists, it prints `2` and returns, indicating that sending invitations to just these two friends is sufficient.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`, indicating that at least three friends need to be invited.

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1()`. The logic inside `func_1()` is sound and correctly handles the problem constraints. The only issue was the missing call to `func_1()` within the main loop, which has been fixed.

Therefore, the original assessment was accurate in identifying the missing call to `func_1()`, but the corrected program now meets the requirements of the problem description.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
