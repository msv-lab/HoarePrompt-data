Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a predefined set of inputs (t, n, p) where t is an integer between 1 and 5000, n is an integer between 2 and 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers each between 1 and n, excluding the index position. The function returns information based on these inputs.**

Note: The actual processing logic is not described here, only the parameters and expected inputs are outlined.
