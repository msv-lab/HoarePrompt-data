Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", and we read an input but did not process it yet.**

The code `input()` reads an input from the user but does not perform any operations on it. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and the trump suit remain unchanged. The input is stored in the default input buffer but has not been assigned to any variable.
