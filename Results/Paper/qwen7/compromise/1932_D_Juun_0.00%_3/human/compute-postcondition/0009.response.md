Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, `trumps` is a list of ranks (strings) that may have some elements popped, `answers` is a list of strings where for each suit that appears more than once in the input, the string contains the sorted ranks of that suit concatenated with the suit itself followed by the last remaining trump rank, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to None or a string with the sorted ranks of that suit. If a suit does not appear more than once, its value in the `suits` dictionary remains None. If `trumps` list becomes empty before processing all suits, the program prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns.
