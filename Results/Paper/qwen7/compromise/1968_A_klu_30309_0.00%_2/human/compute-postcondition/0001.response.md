Output State: **`max_val` is 1, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.**

Explanation: The code initializes `max_val` to 1. Since `x` was previously an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, and no operation has been performed on `x`, its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `max_val` being set to 1 and `x` retaining its original condition.
