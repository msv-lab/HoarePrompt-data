You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

        print(y)

def func_1(x):

        if x % y == 0:
            if 2 * y >= x:

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `x` such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and returns the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to half of `x`. It iterates through possible values of `y` starting from `x - 1` down to 2, checking if `y` is a divisor of `x` and if `2 * y` is greater than or equal to `x`. If both conditions are met, it returns `y`; otherwise, it continues the search and updates the maximum value found. If no suitable `y` is found, it returns the maximum value found during the iteration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's reason through the program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads each value of `x` within the specified range (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function aims to find the value of `y` such that `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized.
   - It iterates over all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 2.
   - For each `y`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `y` (`x % y == 0`).
   - If `x` is divisible by `y`, it further checks if `2 * y >= x`.
     - If true, it returns `y` immediately because this ensures `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized.
     - If false, it updates `max_val` to `y` but does not return immediately.
   - After the loop, it returns `max_val`.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic of the function is almost correct but has a flaw.
   - The condition `2 * y >= x` is unnecessary and incorrect for maximizing `gcd(x, y) + y`.
   - Instead, the goal should be to maximize `gcd(x, y) + y`, which means finding the largest `y` that divides `x`.

4. **Optimization**:
   - The correct approach would be to start with `y = x // 2` and check downwards until `y` is found.
   - This ensures that we get the largest possible `y` that divides `x`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles edge cases like when `x` is prime or small values.

Given these points, the current implementation is flawed due to the unnecessary condition `2 * y >= x`. Let's correct the function:

```python
def func_1(x):
    """Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

  Args:
    x: The given integer.

  Returns:
    The optimal y.
  """
    for y in range(x // 2, 0, -1):
        if x % y == 0:
            return y
    return 1  # In case no divisor is found (should not happen within the given constraints)
```

With this corrected function, the program will now correctly find the maximum `y` that satisfies the condition.

**Conclusion:**
The original program is incorrect due to the unnecessary condition `2 * y >= x`. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
