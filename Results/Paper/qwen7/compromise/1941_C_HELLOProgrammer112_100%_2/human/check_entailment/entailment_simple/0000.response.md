Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic implemented in the function matches the problem statement. The goal is to find the minimum number of characters to remove to make the string beautiful, i.e., to remove all occurrences of the substrings "map" or "pie".

Here's a breakdown of the logic in the provided function:

1. **Input Reading**: The function reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Counting Substrings**:
   - `x = s.count('map')`: Counts the number of times "map" appears in the string `s`.
   - `y = s.count('pie')`: Counts the number of times "pie" appears in the string `s`.
   - `z = s.count('mapie')`: Counts the number of times "mapie" appears in the string `s`. This is a crucial step because "mapie" is a combination of both "map" and "pie" and should only be counted once.

3. **Calculating Minimum Deletions**:
   - The expression `x + y - z` calculates the minimum number of deletions required. This is because each occurrence of "mapie" is counted twice (once in `x` and once in `y`), so we subtract `z` to avoid double-counting.

4. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case.

Given this logic, the function correctly calculates the minimum number of deletions needed to make the string beautiful. It handles overlapping substrings appropriately by using `z` to account for the overlap.

Therefore, the provided function correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
