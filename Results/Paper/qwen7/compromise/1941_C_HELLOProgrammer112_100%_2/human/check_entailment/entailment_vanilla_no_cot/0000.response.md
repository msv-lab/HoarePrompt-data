Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. The logic in the code counts occurrences of "map" and "pie" but does not handle overlapping substrings or the removal of characters to avoid both "map" and "pie" simultaneously.

To solve this problem correctly, we should iterate through the string and check for the presence of "map" and "pie". When either is found, we should calculate the minimum deletions needed to remove one of these substrings. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        i = 0
        deletions = 0
        
        while i < len(s):
            if "map" in s[i:]:
                start = s[i:].find("map")
                end = start + 3
                deletions += len("map") - (end - i)
                i = end
            elif "pie" in s[i:]:
                start = s[i:].find("pie")
                end = start + 3
                deletions += len("pie") - (end - i)
                i = end
            else:
                break
        
        print(deletions)

func()
```

This version iterates through the string and checks for the presence of "map" and "pie" substrings, calculating the minimum deletions needed to remove them.
