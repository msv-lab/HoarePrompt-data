Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer `t` indicating the number of queries, an integer `n` representing the length of the string `s`, and a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. For each query within a test case, the function counts the occurrences of the substrings "map", "pie", and "mapie" in `s`. It then calculates and prints the result of the expression `x + y - z` for each query, where `x` is the count of "map", `y` is the count of "pie", and `z` is the count of "mapie". The function outputs these results for all queries in all test cases.**
