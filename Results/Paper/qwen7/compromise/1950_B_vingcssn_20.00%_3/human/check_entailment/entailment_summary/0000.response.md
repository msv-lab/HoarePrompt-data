Reasoning:
- The program correctly handles the cases for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4` by printing the corresponding 2x2, 4x4, 6x6, and 8x8 checkerboard patterns.
- However, for `n > 4`, the program incorrectly prints "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the expected 2n x 2n checkerboard pattern.
- According to the problem statement, the program should generate a 2n x 2n checkerboard pattern for any `n` within the range [1, 20], and there's no mention of handling values outside this range by printing a specific message.

Given that the program fails to generate the correct output for `n > 4`, it does not fully meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
