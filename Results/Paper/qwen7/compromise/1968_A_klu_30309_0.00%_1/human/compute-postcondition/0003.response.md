Output State: **max_val is 1.**

Explanation: The given loop checks for divisors of `x` in descending order from `x-1` to `2`. If it finds a divisor `y` such that `2 * y >= x`, it returns `y`. Otherwise, it updates `max_val` with `y`. Since the loop starts from `x-1` and goes down to `2`, the smallest possible value for `x` is `3` (as `x-1` should be at least `1`). For any `x >= 3`, the loop will check the largest possible divisor first, which is `x-1`. However, since `x > y` in this case, `2 * y` will always be greater than `x`, leading to no change in `max_val` and no early return. Therefore, `max_val` remains `1` as initialized.
