Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000.
- `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `n`.
- `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.

We need to evaluate the expression `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n`.

Let's break it down:

1. `neg` is the count of '-' characters in the string `s`.
2. The expression `n - 2 * neg` will be evaluated if `n` is not equal to `neg`.
3. If `n` is equal to `neg`, then the expression simplifies to just `n`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `neg` are not specified, we can't provide a specific numerical answer. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n (where n is the input integer and neg is the number of '-' characters in the string s)**
