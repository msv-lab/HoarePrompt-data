Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires splitting the array `a` (represented by the string `s`) into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **Given Program Logic**:
   - The program counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores this count in `neg`.
   - It then calculates and prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` (the length of the string) is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The logic in `func_1()` does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.
   - For example, consider the test case with `s = "--+++++++-"`. The program would count 7 '-' characters and 9 '+' characters, so `neg = 7` and `n = 16`. The program would then print `16 - 2 * 7 = 2`, which is incorrect because the optimal split would be `(["-", "-", "+", "+", "+", "+", "+", "+", "+", "-"])` resulting in a penalty of `0`.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves dynamic programming or greedy algorithms to find the optimal splits. However, the given program does not implement any such strategy.

Based on the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
