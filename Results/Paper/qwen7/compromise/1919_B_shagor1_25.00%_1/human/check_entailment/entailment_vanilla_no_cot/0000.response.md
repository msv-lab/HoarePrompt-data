Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not properly calculate the minimum possible penalty based on the given rules. The function `func_1` simply counts the number of '-' characters in the string and uses this to compute a penalty, which does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement.

The correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal splits, but the current implementation does not achieve this.
