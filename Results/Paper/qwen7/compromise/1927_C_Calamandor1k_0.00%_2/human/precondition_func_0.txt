t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, and k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m). Each test case consists of two arrays a and b, where a has n integers and b has m integers, and each integer in both arrays is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.
