Output State: **`t` is 4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from further splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
