Output State: **`i` is 2, `count_a` is 1, `count_b` is 1**.

The code `count_b += 1` increments the value of `count_b` by 1. Since `count_b` was initially 0 (implied from the initial state where no other value is given), it is now 1. The values of `i` and `count_a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
