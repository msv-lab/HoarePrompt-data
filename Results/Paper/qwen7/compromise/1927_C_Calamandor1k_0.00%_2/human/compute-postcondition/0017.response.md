Postcondition: **`len_a` is at least 1, if `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`, then `count_a` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`. There is no change in the postcondition if the condition `a[i] <= k` is not met. Additionally, `len_b` is greater than `i + 1`, and the current value of `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`.**
