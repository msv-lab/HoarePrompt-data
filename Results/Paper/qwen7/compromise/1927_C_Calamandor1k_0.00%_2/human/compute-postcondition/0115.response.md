Postcondition: **`i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`, `count_a` is either 0, 1, or 2, `count_b` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`, `d` is `k // 2`, and `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k` if the condition `b[i] <= k` is true, otherwise `count_b` remains 0.**
