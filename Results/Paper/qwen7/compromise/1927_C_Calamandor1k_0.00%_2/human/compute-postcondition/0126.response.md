Postcondition: **`i` is `max(len_a, len_b)`, `count_a` is either 1, 2, or 3, `count_b` is either 0 or 1 (increased by 1 if the condition `b[i] <= k` is true), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`, `d` is `k // 2`. If `b[i] <= k`, `count_b` is increased by 1.**
