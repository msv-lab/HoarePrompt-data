The function processes a polygon represented by a graph, starting from a given vertex. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal, visiting all vertices connected to the initial vertex and marking them as visited. After completing the traversal, all vertices in the graph are marked as visited, and the function prints the order in which the vertices were visited.
