### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided code does not address the problem statement correctly. However, let's analyze the problem again to ensure we understand the requirements and verify if there is a way to implement the solution using the given functions.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input**: 
   - \(n\) (number of sides of the polygon)
   - \(x\) (number of vertices Bessie has chosen)
   - \(y\) (maximum number of other vertices you can choose; in this version, \(y = 0\))

2. **Output**:
   - Maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

3. **Key Insight**:
   - A regular polygon with \(n\) sides can be divided into \(n-2\) triangles using non-intersecting diagonals.
   - Given \(x\) chosen vertices, the remaining vertices that can be chosen are \(y\).
   - The goal is to maximize the number of triangles formed by these vertices.

4. **Constraints**:
   - \(4 \leq n \leq 10^9\)
   - \(2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5)\)
   - \(y = 0\)

5. **Solution**:
   - Since \(y = 0\), Bessie cannot choose any additional vertices.
   - The maximum number of triangles that can be formed is \(x - 2\) (since at least 3 vertices are needed to form a triangle).

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the solution is straightforward. We do not need any complex algorithms or data structures; we just need to compute \(x - 2\).

#### Code Evaluation:
- The provided code includes many utility functions that are not relevant to solving the problem.
- There is no function that computes the maximum number of triangles based on the given \(x\).

Since the code does not contain any function that implements the required logic, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.
