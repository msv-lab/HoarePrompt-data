Output State: **`ver` is the first element in `q` that was removed using `popleft()`, all nodes in the graph that are reachable from the starting node (`ver`) are marked as visited (`vis[node] == 1`), and `q` contains at least one node excluding the one that was just removed.**

This means that the starting node (`ver`) has been processed, and all its reachable nodes are now marked as visited. The queue `q` has been updated to exclude the node that was just processed.
