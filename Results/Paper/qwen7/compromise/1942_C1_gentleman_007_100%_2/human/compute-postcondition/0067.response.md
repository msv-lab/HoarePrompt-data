Functionality: **The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the given vertex `ver`. It marks all vertices reachable from `ver` as visited in the `vis` list and prints the visited vertices in the order they were visited. The function does not return any value but modifies the `vis` list to indicate visited nodes.**
