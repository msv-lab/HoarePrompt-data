Postcondition: `q` is a deque containing the remaining elements after possibly removing the first element, `ver` is the first element that was removed from the deque, `graph` is unchanged, `vis[ver]` is set to 1, `vis[node]` is set to 1, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, and `q` now contains the node `node` if `vis[node]` was not previously set to 1.
