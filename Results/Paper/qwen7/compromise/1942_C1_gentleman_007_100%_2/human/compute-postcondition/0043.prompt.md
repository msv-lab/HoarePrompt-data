Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is the first element in `q` that was removed using `popleft()`, all nodes in the graph that are reachable from the starting node (`ver`) are marked as visited (`vis[node] == 1`), and `q` contains at least one node excluding the one that was just removed.
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ver` is the first element in `q` that was removed using `popleft()`, `q` contains the node that was appended, `ver` retains its original value, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least one node where `vis[node]` is currently equal to 0, and `q` contains at least one node excluding the one that was just removed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ver` retains its original value, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one node where `vis[node]` is equal to 0, and after executing the if statement, `vis[node]` is set to 1 for the node contained in `q`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ver` retains its original value, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one node where `vis[node]` is equal to 0, and after executing the if statement, `vis[node]` for the node that was just appended to `q` is now equal to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
