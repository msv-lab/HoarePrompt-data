Output State: **`i` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1; `j` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1; `l` is a list with the element `a[i]` appended to it.**

The code `l.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `l`. Since `i` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, it remains unchanged, and `j` also remains unchanged. The list `l` now includes the element `a[i]`.
