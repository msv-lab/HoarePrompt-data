Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: a string `a` and a list of integers `b`. It returns a reversed string formed by joining the elements of a list `l`.**

This means the function takes a string `a` and a list of integers `b` as inputs. However, based on the provided output description, it seems there might be a misunderstanding since the output description does not directly relate to the parameters given. Typically, the function would process the parameters and return a specific value or structure. Given the output description, it appears the function should return a reversed string formed by joining elements from a list `l`, but the parameters do not align with this output. Assuming the intention was to describe a function that processes the parameters and returns a reversed string, the described functionality would be as stated above.
