Output State: **All nodes that are reachable from the starting node (`ver`) have been visited (`vis[node] == 1`), and `q` is now an empty queue because `ver` was removed using `q.popleft()`**.

Explanation: The code `ver = q.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the queue `q` and assigns it to `ver`. This means `q` is no longer non-empty, and `ver` now holds the value of the node that was previously at the front of the queue. All other conditions remain unchanged, meaning all nodes reachable from the starting node have been visited.
