Output State: **`vis[node]` is now equal to 1, `q` now contains the node that was appended, `ver` retains its original value, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least one node where `vis[node]` is currently equal to 0, and `q` contains at least one node excluding the one that was just removed.**

Explanation: The code sets the value of `vis[node]` to 1, indicating that the node has been visited. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
