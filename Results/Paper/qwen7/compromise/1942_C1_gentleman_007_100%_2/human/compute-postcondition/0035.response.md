Output State: **`ver` retains its original value, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one node where `vis[node]` is equal to 0, and `q` contains the node; now `vis[node]` is equal to 1.**

This means that the value of `ver` remains unchanged, `graph[ver]` still contains at least one node where `vis[node]` was previously 0, and `q` still contains the node. After executing the line `vis[node] = 1`, the `vis[node]` for that particular node has been updated to 1.
