The function `func_25` accepts a parameter `ver`, which is an integer representing a vertex in the graph. It also accepts a parameter `graph`, which is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices. Additionally, it accepts a parameter `vis`, which is a list or array of boolean values used to keep track of visited vertices, with the same length as the number of vertices in the graph.

The function checks if the vertex `ver` has already been visited according to the `vis` list. If `ver` has not been visited, it marks `ver` as visited in the `vis` list and returns `True`. If `ver` has already been visited, it returns `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a vertex `ver`, a graph represented as a dictionary, and a visitation status list `vis`. It returns `True` if the vertex `ver` has not been visited, marking it as visited in the `vis` list. Otherwise, it returns `False` if the vertex `ver` has already been visited.**
