Output State: **`i` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1; `j` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1; `l` is a list with one element `a[i]`.**

The code appends `a[i]` to the list `l`. Since `i` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, the value of `i` remains unchanged, and `j` also remains unchanged. The list `l` is updated to include the element `a[i]`.
