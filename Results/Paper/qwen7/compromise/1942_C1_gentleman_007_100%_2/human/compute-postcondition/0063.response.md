Output State: All nodes that are reachable from the starting node (`ver`) have been visited (`vis[node] == 1` for all nodes that were initially reachable), and the queue `q` is empty. The graph `graph[ver]` does not contain any unvisited nodes, meaning all connected nodes have been processed.

In this final state, the loop has iteratively marked all connected nodes as visited and added them to the queue until no more nodes could be reached from the starting node. As a result, the queue `q` is now empty, and the visitation status `vis[node]` is `1` for all nodes that were initially reachable from `ver`.
