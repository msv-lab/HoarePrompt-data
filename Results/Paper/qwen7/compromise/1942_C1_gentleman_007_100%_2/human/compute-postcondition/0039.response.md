Output State: **`ver` retains its original value, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one node where `vis[node]` is equal to 0, `q` contains the node that was just appended.**

Explanation: The code `q.append(node)` appends the `node` to the list `q`. The other variables retain their previous states. Specifically, `ver` remains unchanged, `graph[ver]` still contains at least one node where `vis[node]` is equal to 0, and now `q` includes the node that was just appended.
