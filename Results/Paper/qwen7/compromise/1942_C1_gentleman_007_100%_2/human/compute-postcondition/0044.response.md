The only variable in the loop head is the length of `q`, which is `len(q)`. Therefore, we can only adjust this variable.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `len(q)` being greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is empty, meaning `len(q)` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `len(q)` must be greater than 0.

State: **All nodes that are reachable from the starting node (`ver`) have been visited (`vis[node] == 1`), and `q` must not be empty (i.e., `len(q) > 0`).**
