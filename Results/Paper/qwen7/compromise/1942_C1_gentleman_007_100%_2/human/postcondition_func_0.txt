The function reads input from the standard input, specifically three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) for each test case. These integers satisfy the conditions \( 4 \leq n \leq 10^9 \), \( 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \times 10^5) \), and \( y = 0 \). The function then returns these three integers as a result.
