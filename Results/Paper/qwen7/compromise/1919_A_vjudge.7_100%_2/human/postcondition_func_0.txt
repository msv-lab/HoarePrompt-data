The function reads multiple pairs of non-negative integers \(a\) and \(b\) (where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\)) from the standard input, checks if their sum is even, and prints 'Bob' if the sum is even, otherwise prints 'Alice' for each pair. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly to the standard output.
