Output State: **`max` is the maximum value between `temp[1]` and the original `max`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `temp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 1 and containing the next three elements sorted.**

Explanation: The code `temp.sort()` sorts the sublist `temp`. Since `temp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 1 and containing the next three elements, sorting it does not change its nature as a sublist starting from index 1, but it ensures that these three elements are now in ascending order. The values of `max`, `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
