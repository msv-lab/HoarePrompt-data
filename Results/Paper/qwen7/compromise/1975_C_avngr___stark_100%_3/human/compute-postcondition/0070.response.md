Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `temp` is a sorted list consisting of elements from index `i` to `i + 2` in the original list `a`.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `temp` in ascending order. Since sorting does not affect the values of `i` or the original list `a`, `i` remains `n - 3`. The list `temp` is updated to be a sorted version of its original elements.
