Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `temp` is the list consisting of elements from index `i` to `i + 2` in the original list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `temp = a[i:i + 3]` slices the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is `n - 3`) and includes the next two elements, ending at index `i + 2`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, but a new variable `temp` is created and assigned the sliced portion of the list `a`.
