Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n - 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `t` is 0 (not relevant to the loop).
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `max` is now equal to `temp[1]` (which is greater than the previous `max`).
   - `i` is 3.
   - `temp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 1 and ending at index 3, and `temp` is sorted.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 4.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n - 2`. Given that `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 5 (since 3 < n - 2 implies n > 5).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `t` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is now equal to `temp[1]` which is greater than the previous `max`, and `i` is 4; `temp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 1 and ending at index 4, and `temp` is sorted**.
