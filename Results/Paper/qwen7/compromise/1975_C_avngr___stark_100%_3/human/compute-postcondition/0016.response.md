Postcondition: `max` is updated to the maximum value between `max` and `temp[1]`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `temp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` and containing the next two elements sorted.
