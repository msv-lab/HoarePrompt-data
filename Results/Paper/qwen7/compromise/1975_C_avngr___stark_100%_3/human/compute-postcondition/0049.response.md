Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `t` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is now equal to `temp[1]` which is greater than the previous `max`, and `i` is 4; `temp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 4 and ending at index 6, and `temp` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `temp.sort()` sorts the sublist `temp`. Since `temp` was previously a sublist of `a` starting from index 4 and ending at index 6 and was sorted, sorting it again does not change its order. Therefore, the values of `n`, `t`, `a`, `max`, `i`, and `temp` remain unchanged except that `temp` is explicitly stated to be sorted after the operation.
