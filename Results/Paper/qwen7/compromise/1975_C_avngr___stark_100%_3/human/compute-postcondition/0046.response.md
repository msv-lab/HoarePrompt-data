Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 2, `t` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is now equal to `temp[1]` which is greater than the previous `max`, and `i` is 3; `temp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 1 and ending at index 3, and `temp` is sorted.**
