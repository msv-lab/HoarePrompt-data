Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n - 2)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - From the given state, `i` is initially set to `n - 1`.
   - The loop runs from `i` to `n - 3` (since `range(n - 2)` generates values from `0` to `n - 3`).

3. **Adjust the State of `i`**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` should be at least `n - 3`. Since `i` is currently `n - 1`, we need to decrement `i` to `n - 3`.

4. **Adjust the State of `n`**:
   - The value of `n` must be such that `n - 3` is a valid index. Therefore, `n` must be at least 3.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - The other variables (`t`, `a`, `max`, `temp`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` must be at least 3**
