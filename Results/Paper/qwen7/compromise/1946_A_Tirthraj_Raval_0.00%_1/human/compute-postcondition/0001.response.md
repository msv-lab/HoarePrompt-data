Output State: **t is an input integer, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and its properties (being a positive integer within the specified range) are preserved. The initial state of the array `a` is not affected by this code snippet.
