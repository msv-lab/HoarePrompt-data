Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases, each containing a positive integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it returns information about the array `a` based on the given constraints.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each with a positive integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers, where each integer in the array is within the specified range. The function does not return a single value but processes each test case according to the given constraints and provides relevant information or results for each case.
