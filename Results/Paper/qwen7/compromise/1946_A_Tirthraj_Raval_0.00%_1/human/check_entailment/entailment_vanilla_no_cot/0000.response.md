Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Median**: The code calculates `p` as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, which is incorrect for determining the median index. For an array of size `n`, the median index should be `n // 2` if `n` is odd, or the average of the two middle indices if `n` is even.

2. **Incorrect Counting of Operations**: The code counts the occurrences of the current median value (`a[p]`) but does not determine how many operations are needed to make the median greater than its current value.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
- Find the median index.
- Determine the target value that the median needs to reach to be increased.
- Calculate the number of operations required to change the elements to achieve this target.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Find the median index
        median_index = n // 2
        
        # If n is odd, the median is the middle element
        if n % 2 == 1:
            current_median = a[median_index]
            target_value = current_median + 1
        else:
            # If n is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements
            lower_median = a[median_index - 1]
            upper_median = a[median_index]
            current_median = min(lower_median, upper_median)
            target_value = current_median + 1
        
        # Count the number of operations needed
        operations = 0
        for val in a:
            if val <= current_median:
                operations += 1
        
        print(operations)

func()
```

This corrected function properly calculates the median and the number of operations required to increase the median.
