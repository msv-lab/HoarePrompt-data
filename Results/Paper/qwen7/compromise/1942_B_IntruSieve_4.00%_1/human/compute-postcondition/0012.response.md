Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers `arr` and calculates a list `mex` based on specific conditions. It then prints each element of `mex` separated by a space. After processing, `minn` is updated to be greater than or equal to the maximum value in `arr`, while `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `maxx` remain unchanged. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints the `mex` list.**
