Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to be part of the main logic required to solve the problem. The problem requires handling the movements of players and balls, checking for eliminations, and determining scoring events. However, the given functions only handle player eliminations and do not cover the full scope of the problem.

For instance, the problem requires handling the movement of the Quaffle, catching the Quaffle by players, throwing the Quaffle, and scoring points. The provided functions do not handle these aspects of the problem. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
