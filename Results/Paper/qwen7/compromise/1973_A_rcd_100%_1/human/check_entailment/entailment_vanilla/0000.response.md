Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which denotes the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. If not, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This check is necessary because the total points must be even since each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 2 points in total (in case of a draw).

3. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, it directly prints `p1 + p2`. This condition ensures that the highest score (`p3`) is at least the sum of the other two scores, which is a necessary condition for the scores to be feasible given the rules of the game.

4. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the above condition is false, the program enters a loop where it tries to find the maximum number of draws. 
     - It initializes `x` and `y` such that `x` represents the number of draws involving the first player and `y` represents the number of draws involving the second player.
     - The loop continues until `y >= x`.
     - Inside the loop, it checks if the remaining points for the first player (`p1 - x`) are less than or equal to the remaining points for the second player (`p2 - y`). If true, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it increments `x` and decrements `y`.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid solution, it prints `p3`.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Even Total Points Check:**
   - This check is correct because the total points must be even for the scores to be valid.

2. **Feasibility Check:**
   - The condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` is a necessary but not sufficient condition. It ensures that the highest score is at least the sum of the other two scores, which is a basic requirement for the scores to be feasible. However, it does not guarantee that the scores can be achieved through a valid sequence of games.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws seems flawed. The approach assumes that the remaining points for the first player should be less than or equal to the remaining points for the second player, which is not always correct. For example, consider the case `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 2`. The correct maximum number of draws is 1, but the program would incorrectly calculate it as 0.

### Example Counter-Case:

Consider the input:
```
1
1 1 2
```

- The total points are `1 + 1 + 2 = 4`, which is even.
- `p3 = 2` is not greater than or equal to `p1 + p2 = 2`.
- The program enters the loop and calculates the maximum number of draws.
- It sets `x = 0` and `y = 2`.
- The loop runs and finds that `p1 - 0 = 1` is not less than or equal to `p2 - 2 = -1`, so it increments `x` and decrements `y`.
- The loop continues until `y < x`, and it prints `p3 = 2`.

However, the correct maximum number of draws is 1, as one draw between the first and second player and one win for the third player would achieve the scores.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in calculating the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
