To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze it step by step:

### Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initial Checks:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - It checks if `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 == 0`. If not, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points to the winners or 2 points in total if it's a draw).
   - This check is necessary because an odd total score is impossible under the given scoring rules.

2. **Handling Special Cases:**
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it directly prints `p1 + p2` which is the maximum possible number of draws if the highest score is at least the sum of the other two scores.
   - This is a special case where the highest scorer has enough points to cover all the points of the other two players without needing any draws.

3. **General Case Handling:**
   - For the general case, it initializes `x` and `y` to 0 and `p3` respectively.
   - It then enters a loop where it tries to find the maximum number of draws by adjusting `x` and `y` such that the conditions are met.
   - The loop continues until `y < x`, checking if `p1 - x <= p2 - y` and printing the result accordingly.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Logic for Maximum Draws Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws seems flawed. Specifically, the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` does not correctly account for the constraints of the problem.
   - The approach should consider the total points and how they can be distributed among wins and draws.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle all edge cases properly. For example, it fails to correctly identify scenarios where the scores are inconsistent with the rules (e.g., `1 1 10`).

### Corrected Approach

A more accurate approach would involve:
- Ensuring the total points are even.
- Checking if the highest score can be achieved with the given constraints.
- Calculating the maximum number of draws by considering the distribution of points.

### Conclusion

The given program has logical flaws and does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

**False**
