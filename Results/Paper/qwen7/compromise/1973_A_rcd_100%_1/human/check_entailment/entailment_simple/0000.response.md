Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If not, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case, which is correct because the total points must be even for the given scoring system.
3. If the sum is even, it checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If true, it prints `p1 + p2`, which is the maximum possible number of draws when `p3` is the highest score and can be achieved by a series of draws between the other two players.
4. If the above condition fails, it enters a while loop to find the maximum number of draws. This loop iteratively adjusts `x` and `y` (representing the number of wins for the first and second players, respectively) until it finds a valid configuration or determines that no valid configuration exists.
5. The logic inside the while loop ensures that the difference in points between the first and second players minus the number of wins for each player does not exceed the difference in their scores. This correctly models the scoring system.
6. The final state analysis is correct, as the program will terminate after processing all test cases, and the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will reflect the last processed test case.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
