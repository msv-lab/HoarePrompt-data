Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into integers, assigning them to the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. Since the actual values are not provided, we can only state that these variables now hold integers entered by the user.
