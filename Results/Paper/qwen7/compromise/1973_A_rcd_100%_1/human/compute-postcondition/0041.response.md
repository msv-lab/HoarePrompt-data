Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are assigned the values of the integers entered by the user.**

The code `p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` respectively. The conditions about `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` remain valid, and `p3` still needs to be less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
