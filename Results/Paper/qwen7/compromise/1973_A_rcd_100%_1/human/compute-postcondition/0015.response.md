Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.
- `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is equal to `p3` and `y` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`.

We need to determine the value of `p1 - x + p3` when the print statement executes.

Given:
- `x = 0`
- `y = p3`

So, the expression `p1 - x + p3` simplifies to `p1 + p3`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `p1 + p3`.

Output: **p1 + p3**
