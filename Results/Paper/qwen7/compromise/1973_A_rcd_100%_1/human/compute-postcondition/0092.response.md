To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given states.

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop condition is `y >= x`.

### Given States
- `x` is either 0 or 1.
- `p1` is an integer entered by the user.
- `p2` is an integer entered by the user.
- `p3` is an integer entered by the user.
- `y` is `y - 1` if `x` is not 0, otherwise `y` remains unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Determine the possible values of `y` after the previous iteration:**
   - If `x` is 0, then `y` remains unchanged.
   - If `x` is 1, then `y` is `y - 1`.

2. **Check the loop condition `y >= x`:**
   - For `x = 0`, the loop will continue as long as `y >= 0`.
   - For `x = 1`, the loop will continue as long as `y - 1 >= 1` (or `y >= 2`).

### Adjusting the States
- **For `x = 0`:**
  - The loop can continue as long as `y >= 0`.
  - Since `y` remains unchanged, no adjustment is needed for `y`.

- **For `x = 1`:**
  - The loop can continue as long as `y - 1 >= 1` (or `y >= 2`).
  - Therefore, `y` must be at least 2.

### Conclusion
- If `x` is 0, the loop can continue as long as `y >= 0`.
- If `x` is 1, the loop can continue as long as `y >= 2`.

Since the loop can certainly execute one more time based on the given conditions, we need to ensure that the condition `y >= x` holds true for the next iteration.

### Final State
- If `x` is 0, `y` must be at least 0.
- If `x` is 1, `y` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: `x` is either 0 or 1, `y` must be at least 2 if `x` is 1, otherwise `y` must be at least 0.**
