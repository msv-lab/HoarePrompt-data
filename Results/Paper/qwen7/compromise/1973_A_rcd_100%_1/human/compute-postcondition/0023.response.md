Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.
- `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
- `x` is either 0 or 1.
- `y` is equal to `p3` and `y` must be greater than or equal to 1 if `x` is 1.

The print statement is `print(p1 - x + p3)`. 

To determine the exact output, let's break it down:

1. `p1` and `p3` are integers.
2. `x` is either 0 or 1.
3. `p3` is equal to `y`, and since `y` must be greater than or equal to 1 if `x` is 1, `p3` must also be greater than or equal to 1.

Given these conditions, the expression `p1 - x + p3` will evaluate as follows:

- If `x` is 0, then `p1 - x + p3` simplifies to `p1 + p3`.
- If `x` is 1, then `p1 - x + p3` simplifies to `p1 - 1 + p3`.

Since the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not specified, but their combination ensures the sum is even.

Therefore, the output will be either `p1 + p3` or `p1 - 1 + p3`, depending on the value of `x`.

Output: **p1 + p3 (if x is 0) or p1 - 1 + p3 (if x is 1)**
