Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `p3`.**

In this case, the code assigns the value of `p3` to `y`. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.
