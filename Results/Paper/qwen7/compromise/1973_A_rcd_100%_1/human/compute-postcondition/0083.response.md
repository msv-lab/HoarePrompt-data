Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head condition is `y >= x`.

2. **Current States Before the Loop**:
   - `x` is 0.
   - `p1` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `p2` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `p3` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `y` is equal to `p3`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `y >= x` must be true.
   - Given that `x` is 0, the condition simplifies to `y >= 0`.
   - Since `y` is equal to `p3`, the condition becomes `p3 >= 0`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The only variable involved in the loop condition is `y`, which is `p3`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `p3` (or `y`) is greater than or equal to 0.

So, the final state right before the loop should be:

**State: `x` is 0, `p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` is an integer entered by the user and must be greater than or equal to 0, `y` is equal to `p3`**
