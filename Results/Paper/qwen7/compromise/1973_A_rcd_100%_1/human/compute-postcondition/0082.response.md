Output State: **`x` is 0, `p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` is an integer entered by the user, `y` is equal to `p3`.**

The code assigns the value of `p3` to `y`. The values of `x`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `y` and retains the initial values of `x`, `p1`, and `p2`.
