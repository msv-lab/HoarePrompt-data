Output State: **`x` is 0, `p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` is an integer entered by the user, `y` must be greater than or equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block explicitly shown in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. It only indicates that the program would exit the current loop or conditional block. All the initial conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged.
