You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 1000 test cases, where each test case consists of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the range 0 to 9. For each test case, it prints one of three outcomes: 'STAIR' if \(a < b < c\), 'PEAK' if \(a < b > c\), or 'NONE' for all other cases. The final state of the program is a series of outputs corresponding to each test case, with each output indicating whether the numbers form a 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or neither.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal (i.e., `a == b == c`). According to the problem description, such a case should result in "NONE", but the current implementation will incorrectly identify it as either "STAIR" or "PEAK" depending on the order of comparison. For example, if `a = b = c = 5`, the program will output "PEAK" because it checks `a < b > c` first, which is true. This violates the requirement that such cases should output "NONE".

To fix this, the program should explicitly check for the case where all three digits are equal and handle it separately:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

With this modification, the program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
