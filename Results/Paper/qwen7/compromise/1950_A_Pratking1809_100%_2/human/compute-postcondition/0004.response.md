Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three integers a, b, and c within the constraints 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9 for each test case, where t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it returns either "valid" if all conditions are met or "invalid" if any condition is not satisfied.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each involving three integers a, b, and c, and checks if they meet the specified constraints. It returns "valid" if all test cases meet the criteria and "invalid" if any do not.
