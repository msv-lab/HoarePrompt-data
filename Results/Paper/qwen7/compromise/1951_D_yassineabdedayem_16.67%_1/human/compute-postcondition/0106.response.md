Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in tab:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `tab`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute again, `tab` must have at least one element. This is because the loop iterates over each element in `tab`, starting from the first element.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is the first element of `tab`.
   - `tab` must have at least one element.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is now the first element of `tab`, after the current iteration, `i` will be set to the second element of `tab` if it exists.
   - For the loop to execute again, `tab` must still have at least one element remaining (i.e., it must have at least two elements).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now the second element of `tab` (if it exists), and `tab` must have at least two elements.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the second element of `tab`, `tab` must have at least two elements**
