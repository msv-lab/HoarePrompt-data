Output State: **`rep` is 2, `k` is adjusted based on the condition `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k` holds true, then `k` is reduced by `Max`. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `Min`. `Min` remains as `min(n // k, k)`, and `Max` remains as `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged according to the initial postconditions. The value of `rep` stays as 2, and the conditions for adjusting `k` based on `Max` and `Min` remain the same.
