Output State: **All variables except `t` will be reset to their initial states after the loop completes. `t` will be 0 since it was decremented by 1 each time the loop ran and there were no further inputs to increment it.**

Explanation: The loop runs for `t` iterations, where `t` is the initial input. After each iteration, `t` is effectively decremented by 1 as the loop processes one instance of `n` and `k`. Since the loop condition is based on `range(t)`, once `t` reaches 0, the loop terminates. At this point, `t` will be 0, and all other variables (`n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`) will revert to their initial states before the loop started, as they are not modified outside the loop body.
