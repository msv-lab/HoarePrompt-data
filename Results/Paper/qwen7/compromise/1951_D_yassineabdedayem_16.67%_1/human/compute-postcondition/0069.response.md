Output State: **`n` must be non-zero, `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`; `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to `k - Min`, where `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
