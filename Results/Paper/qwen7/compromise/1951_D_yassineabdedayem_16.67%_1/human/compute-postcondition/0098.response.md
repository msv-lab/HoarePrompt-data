Output State: `rep` is 60, `k` is adjusted according to the loop's conditions, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of numbers from each iteration of the loop, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration, `i` is the last element of `tab`, `t` is decreased by 1 (t-1), `number` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is not zero, `k` is greater than zero, `rep` is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. Since the loop will run up to 60 times (as specified by the condition `rep < 60`), it will execute exactly 60 times under the given conditions. After 60 iterations, `rep` will be 60. The value of `k` will be adjusted in each iteration based on the conditions inside the loop. The list `tab` will contain the string representation of the `number` chosen in each iteration. The values of `Min` and `Max` will be determined for the final iteration, and `number` will be set to 0 after the loop completes.
