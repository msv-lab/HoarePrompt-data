Postcondition: `total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value, `Min` is n // k if n // k <= k else k, `Max` is int(n / k) if int(n / k) >= k else k, `number` is either `Min` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`, `k` is adjusted to `k - Max` if `number` is `Min` and to `k - Min` if `number` is `Max`, `rep` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` and not zero.
