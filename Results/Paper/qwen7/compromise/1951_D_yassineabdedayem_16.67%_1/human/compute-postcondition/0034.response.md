Output State: **`rep` is 2, `k` is `k - Max`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `number` is `min(n // k, k)`**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by `Max`. Since `Max` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `k`, but we know it is `k - Max`. The values of `Min` and `number` remain unchanged as they are both equal to `min(n // k, k)`. The value of `rep` remains 2 as it was not affected by the code.
