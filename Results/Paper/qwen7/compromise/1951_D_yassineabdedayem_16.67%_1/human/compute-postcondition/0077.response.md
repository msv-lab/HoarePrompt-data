Output State: **`Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `min(n // k, k)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `Min` to the variable `number`. Since `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`, the variable `number` now holds the same value as `Min`. The values of `Max` and the original `Min` remain unchanged.
