Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `rep` is 60.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `tab` is a list containing the string representations of numbers from each iteration of the loop.
   - `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration.
   - `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration.
   - `i` is the last element of `tab`.
   - `t` is decreased by 1 (t-1).
   - `number` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(len(tab))
   ```

Given the initial state, let's analyze the variables involved in the `print(len(tab))` statement:

- `tab` is a list that contains string representations of numbers from each iteration of the loop. Since `k` is initially 0, the loop would start with `n // k` and `int(n / k)` which would be undefined due to division by zero. However, the problem does not specify how the loop is structured or how many iterations occur. 

Since no specific loop structure is provided, we need to infer based on typical behavior. If we assume the loop runs until `k` is incremented and the conditions for `Min` and `Max` are met, the list `tab` would contain the results of these calculations.

However, without the exact loop logic, we can only say that `tab` is a list of strings representing numbers from each iteration. The length of this list depends on how many iterations occurred, but since the exact number of iterations isn't specified, we can only describe it in general terms.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the length of the list `tab`.

Output: **len(tab)**
