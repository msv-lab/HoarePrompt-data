Postcondition: `n` must be non-zero, `k` is adjusted based on the condition, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `number` is either `Min` or `Max` depending on whether `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k` holds true. If the condition is met, `k` is set to `k - Max`, and `number` is set to `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is set to `k - min(n // k, k)`, and `number` is set to `Max`.
