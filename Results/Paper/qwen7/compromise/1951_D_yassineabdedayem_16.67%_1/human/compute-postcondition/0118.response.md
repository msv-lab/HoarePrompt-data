Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration, `i` is the last element of `tab`, `t` is 58, `number` is 0, and `k` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The line `tab = []` initializes an empty list for `tab`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
