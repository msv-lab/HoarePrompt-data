Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, and `number` is either `min((n // k) - (k), k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)` depending on the conditions, `k` is `k - Min` or `k - k` depending on the conditions, and `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The code `n -= Min * Max` updates the value of `n` by subtracting `Min * Max` from it. The values of `total`, `students`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`, `k`, and `tab` remain unchanged except for `n`, which is now updated. The conditions for `number` and `k` are preserved as they were before the operation.
