Output State: **`rep` is 0, `k` is adjusted according to the loop's conditions, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration, `i` is the last element of `tab`, `t` is decreased by 1 (t-1), `number` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `tab` as an empty list. This means that all the elements that were previously in `tab` are no longer there, and now `tab` is simply an empty list. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions.
