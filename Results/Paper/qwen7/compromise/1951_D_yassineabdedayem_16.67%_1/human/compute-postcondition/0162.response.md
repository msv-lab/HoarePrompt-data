Based on the initial state provided:

- `tab` must contain at least one element.
- `i` will be set to the first element of `tab`.

When the `print(i, end=' ')` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i` followed by a space (`end=' '` specifies that there should be no newline after the printed content).

Since `i` is set to the first element of `tab`, and `tab` contains at least one element, `i` will be the value of the first element in `tab`.

Output: **the value of the first element in tab**
