Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer read from standard input and `n` is not zero, `k` is a positive integer read from standard input, `rep` is 0, `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is `min(n // k, k)`, otherwise `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`.
