Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is 0 or less.
- `k` is 0.
- `rep` is 60.
- `number` is the last value assigned to `number` before the loop ended, which would be either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)` depending on the final condition check.
- `tab` is a list containing the string representation of each `number` assigned during the loop's iterations.
- `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration.
- `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration.

Given that `n` is 0 or less and `k` is 0, the division operations `n // k` and `int(n / k)` are undefined due to division by zero. However, since `n` is 0 or less, and `k` is 0, the conditions `min(n // k, k)` and `max(int(n / k), k)` will result in a specific value based on the nature of these operations.

For any non-zero `k`, `n // k` and `int(n / k)` would evaluate to 0 because `n` is 0 or less. But since `k` is 0, these expressions are undefined in mathematical terms but in programming context, they would typically result in an error or a specific handling mechanism. Given the constraints and typical behavior in such scenarios, let's assume the code handles this by setting `number` to a specific value, likely 0, to avoid errors.

Thus, `number`, `Min`, and `Max` would all be 0.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
