Based on the initial state, `i` is the first element of `tab`, and `tab` must have at least one element. Therefore, `i` is the value of the first element in the list `tab`.

The print statement `print(i, end=' ')` will print the value of `i` followed by a space, since `end=' '` specifies that a space should be used instead of a newline.

Output: **i (where i is the first element of the list tab)**
