Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of numbers from each iteration of the loop, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration, `i` is the last element of `tab`, `t` is 58, `number` is 0, and `k` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The line `rep = 0` sets the variable `rep` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
