Output State: **`rep` is 2, `k` is adjusted based on the condition `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k` holds true, then `k` is reduced by `Max`. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `Min`. `Min` remains as `min(n // k, k)`, and `Max` remains as `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `n` is decreased by `Min * Max`**.

Explanation: The code `n -= Min * Max` subtracts the product of `Min` and `Max` from `n`. The values of `rep`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, and `tab` remain unchanged. The updated value of `n` is `n - Min * Max`.
