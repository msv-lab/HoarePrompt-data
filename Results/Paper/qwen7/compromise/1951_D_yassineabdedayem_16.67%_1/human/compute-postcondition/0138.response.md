Postcondition: `total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is either `min(n // (k - Max), k - Max)` or `max(int(n / (k - Max)), k - Max)` depending on the conditions, `k` is adjusted to `k - Max` or `k - min(n // k, k)`, `rep` is 1.
