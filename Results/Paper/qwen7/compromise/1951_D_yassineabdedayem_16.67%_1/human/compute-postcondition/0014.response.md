Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer read from standard input and `n` is not zero, `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)`, `rep` is 0, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to `k - Min`, where `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
