Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and either `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, or `Max` does not equal `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`. In the first case, `number` is `min((n // k) - (k), k)` and `k` is `k - k`. In the second case, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)` and `k` is `k - Min`. `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of the variable `number` to the list `tab`. The values of `total`, `students`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number` remain as described in the initial state, but `tab` now contains the string representation of `number`.
