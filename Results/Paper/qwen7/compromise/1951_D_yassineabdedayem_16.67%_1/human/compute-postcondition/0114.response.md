Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is specified by the `for _ in range(t):` statement. This means the loop variables are `_` (which is typically an underscore indicating a throwaway variable) and `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is 59.

3. **Determine the Next State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `t` should be 58.

4. **Adjust Other States**: The other variables (`rep`, `k`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, `i`, `number`, and `k`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition alone. They remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`rep` is 60, `k` is adjusted according to the loop's conditions, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of numbers from each iteration of the loop, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration, `i` is the last element of `tab`, `t` is 58, `number` is 0, and `k` is not equal to 0.**
