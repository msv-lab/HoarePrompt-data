Output State: **`n` must be non-zero, `k` is adjusted based on the condition, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `number` is either `Min` or `Max` depending on whether `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k` holds true; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`. Since `number` is either `Min` or `Max` based on the given conditions, `tab` now contains this string. The values of `n`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number` remain unchanged from their previous states.
