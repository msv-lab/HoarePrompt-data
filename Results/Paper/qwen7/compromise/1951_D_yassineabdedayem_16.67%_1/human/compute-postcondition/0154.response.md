Output State: `total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration, `number` is either `Min` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`, `k` is adjusted to `k - Max` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `k` is adjusted to `k - Min`, `rep` is 60 (since the loop runs up to 60 iterations), `n` is 0 (since `n` is decreased by `Min * Max` each iteration until it reaches 0), `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` for each iteration, and `t` is 58, `i` is the last element of `tab`, and `number` is 0 since `n` becomes 0.

This means that after the loop completes all 60 iterations, `n` will be 0, and `tab` will contain the sequence of numbers determined by the loop's logic over those iterations. The other variables (`total`, `students`, `Min`, `Max`, `k`, `rep`, `t`, `i`, and `number`) will retain their final values as described.
