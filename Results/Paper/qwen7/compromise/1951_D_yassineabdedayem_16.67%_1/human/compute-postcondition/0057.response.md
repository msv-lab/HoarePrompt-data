Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is reduced to 0 or less.
   - `k` is adjusted according to the loop's conditions.
   - `rep` is 60.
   - `tab` contains the sequence of numbers generated during the loop's execution.
   - `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration.
   - `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration.
   - `i` is the last element of `tab`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the value of `t`, we need to adjust `t` for the next iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 (since `range(t)` would iterate from `t-1` to 0).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `t`.

**State: **`n` is reduced to 0 or less, `k` is adjusted according to the loop's conditions, `rep` is 60, `tab` contains the sequence of numbers generated during the loop's execution, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration, `i` is the last element of `tab`, `t` is decreased by 1**.
