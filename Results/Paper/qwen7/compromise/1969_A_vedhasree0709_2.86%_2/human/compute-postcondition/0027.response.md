Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 4, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1.**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 2, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 3. The other variables (`n`, `l`, and `j`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
