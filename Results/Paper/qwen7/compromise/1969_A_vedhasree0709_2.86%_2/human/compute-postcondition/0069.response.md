Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, splits the input string into individual elements, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then creates a list from these integers. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
