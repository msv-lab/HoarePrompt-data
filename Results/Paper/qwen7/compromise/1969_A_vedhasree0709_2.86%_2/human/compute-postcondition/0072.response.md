State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`.
2. Right before the loop, `i` is 0.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must satisfy the condition `i <= n - 1` when the loop starts.
4. Since `i` is 0, the condition simplifies to `0 <= n - 1`, which means `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0.
5. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop's execution condition.
