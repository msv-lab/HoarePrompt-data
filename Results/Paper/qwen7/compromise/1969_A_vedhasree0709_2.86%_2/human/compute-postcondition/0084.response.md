Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, list `l` has elements such that `l[0]` equals 2 and `l[1]` equals 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `j`, or the elements of list `l`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
