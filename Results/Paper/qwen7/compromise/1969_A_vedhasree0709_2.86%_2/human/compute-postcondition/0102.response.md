Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a test case within a loop or function call where `t`, `n`, and `p` are provided. It checks if `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, and `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers each between 1 and `n` excluding the index position. Based on these conditions, it returns appropriate values or performs specific actions for each test case.**
