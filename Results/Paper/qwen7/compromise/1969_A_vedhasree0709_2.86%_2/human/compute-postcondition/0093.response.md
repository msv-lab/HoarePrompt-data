Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, list `l` has elements such that `l[0]` equals 2 and `l[1] equals 1. If `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `j`.
