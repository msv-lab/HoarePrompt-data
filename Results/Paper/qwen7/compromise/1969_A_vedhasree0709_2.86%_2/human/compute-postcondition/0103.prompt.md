You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        i = 0
        
        j = 0
        
        while i <= n - 1:
            if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        
        if j == 0:
            print(3)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to iterate for each test case until the specified number of iterations (as determined by `input()`) is completed. After all iterations, the final state will depend on whether the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` was met for any `i` within the range of the loop for each test case.
    #
    #If the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is met for any `i` during any of the iterations, `j` will be set to 1, and the loop will print `2` and break. This means that for the test cases where this condition is met, the output will be `2`.
    #
    #For the remaining test cases where the condition is not met, `j` will remain `0`, and the loop will print `3`.
    #
    #Since we do not know the exact number of test cases or the contents of the lists `l` for each test case, the final output state can be described as follows:
    #
    #- For each test case, if the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is met at any point during the loop, the output will be `2`.
    #- For all other test cases, the output will be `3`.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has completed all its iterations, and the outputs consist of `2` for the test cases where the specified condition was met and `3` for the rest of the test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a test case within a loop or function call where `t`, `n`, and `p` are provided. It checks if `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, and `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers each between 1 and `n` excluding the index position. Based on these conditions, it returns appropriate values or performs specific actions for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
