Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - Either `l[0]` is equal to 2 and `l[1]` is equal to 1, in which case the loop or if statement is broken, or there is no change to the variables as there is no else part.

3. **Determine if the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.
   - Given `i` is currently 1, the loop will continue as long as `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 1 (i.e., `n` is greater than or equal to 2).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is already 1, the only variable that needs adjustment is `n`. `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the final state for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
