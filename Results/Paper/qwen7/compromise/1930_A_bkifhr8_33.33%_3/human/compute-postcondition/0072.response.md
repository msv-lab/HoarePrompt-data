Output State: **`i` is (n * 2) + 1, `t` is the same as before, `ans` is 0, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `l` by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `lst = l.split(' ')` splits the input string `l` by spaces and assigns the resulting list to `lst`. The values of `i`, `t`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
