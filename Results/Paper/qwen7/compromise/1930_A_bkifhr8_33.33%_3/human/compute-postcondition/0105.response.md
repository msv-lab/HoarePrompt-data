Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in ans_f:`. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `ans_f`. Since `i` is iterating over `ans_f`, the loop will stop when `ans_f` becomes empty.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
   - `ans_f` is a non-empty list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration.
   - `lst` is an empty list.
   - `i` is not relevant in the final state but was incremented in each iteration.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the length of `ans_f`, we need to ensure that `ans_f` is not empty for the loop to execute again.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `ans_f` is non-empty, meaning it still contains at least one element.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `ans_f` must still contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `ans_f` is still a non-empty list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ans_f` is a non-empty list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration, `lst` is an empty list**.
