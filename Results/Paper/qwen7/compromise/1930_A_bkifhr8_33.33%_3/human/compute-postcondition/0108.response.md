Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in ans_f`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Understand the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ans_f` is a non-empty list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration, and `lst` is an empty list.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `ans_f`. Since `ans_f` is a non-empty list, the loop will execute for each element in `ans_f`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` (which is the current element from `ans_f`) has been processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `ans_f`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is the next element in `ans_f`. Since `ans_f` is a non-empty list, the next value of `i` will be the first element of `ans_f`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ans_f` is a non-empty list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration, `lst` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `ans_f`**
