Output State: **`i` is less than `n * 2 - 1`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and the second element of `lst` is removed.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. It also ensures that if the length of `lst` is not 2, the second element is removed. Since the initial condition specifies that the length of `lst` is 2, the second element is removed, and `ans` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
