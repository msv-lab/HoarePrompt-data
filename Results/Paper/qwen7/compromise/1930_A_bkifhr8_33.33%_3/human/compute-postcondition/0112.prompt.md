You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        
        n = int(input())
        
        l = input()
        
        lst = l.split(' ')
        
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` remains the same as it was initially (an integer between 1 and 5000), `ans_f` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration of the loop, and `lst` is an empty list since all elements have been processed according to the conditions inside the loop. The variable `i` is no longer used in the final state but was incremented in each iteration of the loop. The state of `n` is not relevant in the final output state as it is an input for each iteration and gets replaced with new values in each iteration.
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 5000, ans_f is a list containing the cumulative sums of ans for each iteration, lst is an empty list, i is the last element of ans_f.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of integers including t, n, and a sequence of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}. It returns a result based on the conditions where t ranges from 1 to 5000, n ranges from 1 to 50, and each a_i ranges from 1 to 10^7.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
