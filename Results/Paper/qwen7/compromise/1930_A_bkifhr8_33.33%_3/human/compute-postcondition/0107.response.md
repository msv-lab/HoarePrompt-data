Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in ans_f:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `ans_f`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `ans_f`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the current element from `ans_f`, and `ans_f` is a non-empty list.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since `i` is the current element from `ans_f`, it will be the next element in the list for the next iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `ans_f` must still contain at least one element.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `t` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop head.
- `ans_f` must still be a non-empty list to allow the loop to execute again.
- `i` will be the next element from `ans_f`.

Since `ans_f` is a non-empty list at the end of the previous iteration, it must still be a non-empty list for the next iteration. The value of `i` will be the first element of `ans_f` if `ans_f` is still non-empty.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ans_f` is a non-empty list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration, `i` is the first element of `ans_f`**
