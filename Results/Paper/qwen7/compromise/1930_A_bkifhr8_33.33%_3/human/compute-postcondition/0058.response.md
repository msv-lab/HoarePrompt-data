Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n * 2`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n * 2`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `n * 2`.
   - `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`.
   - If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, the second element of `lst` is removed.
   - If the length of `lst` is 2, either the second element is removed or the list is modified to remove the element at index 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n * 2`.

Given the above points, let's update the state:

- The current value of `i` is such that `i < n * 2`.
- After the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
- For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be less than `n * 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is less than `n * 2 - 1`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, the second element of `lst` is removed. If the length of `lst` is 2, either the second element is removed or the list is modified to remove the element at index 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
