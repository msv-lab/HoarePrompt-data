Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`. These are derived from the list `a` using slicing.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**:
   - `total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`.
   - `a` is a list with at least 3 elements.
   - The first element of `a` is -1000000000.0.
   - The second element of `a` is any value.
   - The third element of `a` is any value.
   - The fourth element of `a` is any value.
   - `v` is `y - x`.
   - `b` is updated by adding `b[-2] + v` if `v > x - w` and `b[-1] + v` if `v > z - y`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop iterates over the elements of `a` using `zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:])`.
   - This means the loop will iterate as long as there are at least 4 elements in `a`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `a`, the list `a` must have at least 4 elements for the loop to continue.
   - The values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be the next set of consecutive elements in `a`.
   - The value of `v` will be `y - x` for the current iteration.
   - The value of `b` will be updated based on the condition provided.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `total` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop.
- `a` must have at least 4 elements for the loop to continue.
- `w` will be the next element in `a` after the current `a[0]`.
- `x` will be the next element in `a` after the current `a[1]`.
- `y` will be the next element in `a` after the current `a[2]`.
- `z` will be the next element in `a` after the current `a[3]`.
- `v` will be `y - x` for the next iteration.
- `b` will be updated based on the condition provided, but its exact value is not specified here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `a` is a list with at least 4 elements, the first element of `a` is -1000000000.0, the second element of `a` is any value, the third element of `a` is any value, the fourth element of `a` is any value, `v` is `y - x`, `b` is updated by adding `b[-2] + v` if `v > x - w` and `b[-1] + v` if `v > z - y`**.
