Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `a` is a list with at least 4 elements, the first element of `a` is -1000000000.0, the second element of `a` is any value, the third element of `a` is any value, the fourth element of `a` is any value, `b` is a list where each element is the sum of the previous two elements plus `v` if certain conditions are met during each iteration of the loop, `u` is the value returned by `r()`
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `a` is a list with at least 4 elements, the first element of `a` is -1000000000.0, the second element of `a` is any value, the third element of `a` is any value, the fourth element of `a` is any value, `b` is a list where each element is the sum of the previous two elements plus `v` if certain conditions are met during each iteration of the loop, `u` is false, `c` and `d` are the results of the function `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is set to a value less than `d`; otherwise, `c` is set to a value greater than or equal to `d`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `a` is a list with at least 4 elements, the first element of `a` is -1000000000.0, the second, third, and fourth elements of `a` are any values, `b` is a list where each element is the sum of the previous two elements plus `v` if certain conditions are met during each iteration of the loop, `u` is `False`, `c` and `d` are the results of the function `r()`, and `c` is updated based on the comparison with `d`. If `c < d`, then `c` is updated accordingly; otherwise, `c` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `a` is a list with at least 4 elements, the first element of `a` is -1000000000.0, the second, third, and fourth elements of `a` are any values, `b` is a list where each element is the sum of the previous two elements plus `v` if certain conditions are met during each iteration of the loop, `u` is `False`, `c` is the result of the function `r()`, `d` is the result of the function `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
