Functionality: **The function accepts a list of parameters including a positive integer t, for each test case, an integer n, and a list a of n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order. Additionally, it accepts an integer m, and for each query, two distinct integers x_i and y_i within the range 1 to n. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the specified conditions.**

This means the function takes multiple inputs: a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` for each test case indicating the size of the list `a`, the list `a` itself containing `n` non-negative integers in strictly increasing order, an integer `m` indicating the number of queries, and for each query, two distinct integers `x_i` and `y_i` within the range 1 to `n`. The function then performs some operations based on these inputs and returns a result accordingly.
