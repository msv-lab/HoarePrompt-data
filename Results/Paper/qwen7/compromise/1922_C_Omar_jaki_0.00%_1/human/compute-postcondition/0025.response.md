Postcondition: `t` is a non-empty value decreased by the total number of iterations of the loop, `r()` has been called twice, `a` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `b` is `[0, 0, v, 2v, 4v]`, `u` is the return value of `r()` and is now `u - 1`, `c` is the first return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()`. The current value of `c` is less than the current value of `d`.
