Output State: **`t` is a non-empty value decreased by 1, `r()` has been called, `a` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `b` is `[0, 0, v ** (v > x - w) + 0, v ** (v > z - y) + 0]`, `v` is `y - x`**.

Explanation:
- `b` is updated using the formula `b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`.
- Initially, `b` is `[0, 0]`.
- The first element of `b` is updated to `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`, which is `0 + v ** (v > x - w)`.
- The second element of `b` is updated to `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`, which is `0 + v ** (v > z - y)`.

Since `v` is `y - x`, the expressions become:
- `b[0]` is `v ** (v > x - w)`, which is `(y - x) ** ((y - x) > x - w)`.
- `b[1]` is `v ** (v > z - y)`, which is `(y - x) ** ((y - x) > z - y)`.

Therefore, `b` becomes `[0, 0, (y - x) ** ((y - x) > x - w), (y - x) ** ((y - x) > z - y)]`.
