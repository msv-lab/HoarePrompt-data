### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to validate the original assessment.

#### Key Functions and Their Purposes:
1. **`func_1(tree: Tree, s: int, x: int) -> (int, int):`**
   - This function aims to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at vertex `s` with a size constraint `x`.
   - The function uses a post-order traversal to update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of each vertex.

2. **`func_2(tree: Tree, v: int, x: int) -> (int, int):`**
   - This function is a recursive helper function for `func_1` to traverse the tree and update the attributes of each vertex.

3. **`func_3(tree: Tree, n: int, k: int, x: int) -> bool:`**
   - This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`.
   - It uses the results from `func_1` to determine if the conditions are met.

4. **`func_4(tree: Tree, n: int, k: int) -> int:`**
   - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and ensure each remaining component has a size at least `x`.
   - It relies on `func_3` to perform the necessary checks.

5. **`func_5():`**
   - This function reads input, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to get the final result.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **`func_1` and `func_2`:**
   - These functions correctly traverse the tree and update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes.
   - However, the key issue is in how these attributes are updated. Specifically, the `remaining_size` should only include the sizes of components that meet the size constraint `x`, and the `good_components` should count the number of such components.
   - The current implementation sums up all the `remaining_size` values without filtering out those that do not meet the size constraint `x`.

2. **`func_3`:**
   - This function checks if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if the remaining size of the components meets the size constraint `x`.
   - The logic here is flawed because it does not correctly filter out components that do not meet the size constraint `x`.

3. **`func_4`:**
   - This function uses binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the conditions.
   - It relies on `func_3` to make the necessary checks, but since `func_3` is flawed, the binary search may not converge to the correct solution.

4. **`func_5`:**
   - This function correctly constructs the tree and calls `func_4` to get the final result.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).

The main issues lie in the `func_1` and `func_3` functions, which do not correctly handle the process of removing edges and ensuring that the remaining components meet the size requirement.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**

The program is incorrect due to the flaws in the logic of `func_1` and `func_3`.
