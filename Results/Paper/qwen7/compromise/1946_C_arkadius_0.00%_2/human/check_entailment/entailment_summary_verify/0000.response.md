### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the provided function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).

#### Function Summaries:
1. **Function 5**: Constructs the tree based on user input, roots the tree, and calls `func_4` to find the maximum \( x \).
2. **Function 4**: Uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \) by calling `func_3`.
3. **Function 3**: Checks if it is possible to remove \( k \) edges such that the number of good components is greater than \( k \) and the remaining size of each component is at least \( x \).
4. **Function 2**: Recursively calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for a subtree.
5. **Function 1**: Uses a post-order traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size for the entire tree.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Function 2 and Function 1**:
   - These functions are supposed to recursively calculate the number of good components and the remaining size for a subtree.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` and `func_2` seems flawed because they do not correctly simulate the removal of edges and update the sizes of the components.
   - Specifically, `func_1` and `func_2` do not properly handle the process of removing edges and ensuring that the remaining components meet the size requirement.

2. **Function 3**:
   - This function checks if it is possible to remove \( k \) edges such that the number of good components is greater than \( k \) and the remaining size of each component is at least \( x \).
   - The logic in `func_3` is based on the incorrect calculations from `func_1` and `func_2`.

3. **Function 4**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \) by calling `func_3`.
   - Since `func_3` relies on the incorrect logic from `func_1` and `func_2`, the binary search will also be incorrect.

4. **Function 5**:
   - This function constructs the tree, roots it, and calls `func_4` to find the maximum \( x \).
   - Given the issues in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`, the overall logic in `func_5` is flawed.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).

**Final: False**
