Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Tree Representation and Input Handling:**
   - The `func_5` function reads the input and constructs a tree.
   - The tree is represented using a class `Tree`, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. However, we assume it correctly handles the tree structure, including adding edges and rooting the tree.

2. **Binary Search for Maximum `x`:**
   - The `func_4` function uses binary search to find the maximum value of `x`.
   - It defines the search bounds (`beg = 1` and `end = n`) and iteratively narrows down the range until `beg` equals `end`.

3. **Checking Feasibility of `x`:**
   - The `func_3` function checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - It uses `func_1` and `func_2` to perform the necessary calculations.

4. **Depth-First Search (DFS) for Component Sizes:**
   - `func_1` performs a DFS to calculate the number of good components (components with at least `x` vertices) and the remaining size of each component.
   - `func_2` recursively calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for subtrees.

### Detailed Analysis of Functions

- **`func_1` and `func_2`:**
  - These functions are used to traverse the tree and calculate the sizes of components.
  - They use a postorder traversal to ensure that all children have been processed before processing the parent.
  - The logic seems correct for calculating the sizes and good components.

- **`func_3`:**
  - This function checks if it is possible to achieve the required conditions with a given `x`.
  - It uses `func_1` to get the initial counts and then checks if the number of good components is greater than or equal to `k` and if the remaining size is at least `x`.

- **`func_4`:**
  - This function uses binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the conditions.
  - The binary search is implemented correctly, and the condition checking in `func_3` is used to determine the feasibility of `x`.

### Potential Issues

- **Tree Class Implementation:**
  - The `Tree` class is not defined in the provided code. If it is implemented correctly, the program should work. However, without seeing the implementation, we cannot guarantee its correctness.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle edge cases explicitly, such as when the tree is a path or when `k` is close to `n-1`. However, the provided examples and the nature of the problem suggest that these cases are handled correctly.

### Conclusion

Given the logical structure and the assumptions about the `Tree` class, the program appears to be correct in terms of the algorithmic approach. The binary search and the recursive DFS traversal seem appropriate for solving the problem.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
