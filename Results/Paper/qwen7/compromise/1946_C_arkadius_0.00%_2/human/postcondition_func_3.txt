The function accepts a tree instance (`tree`), an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, and an integer `k` representing the number of edges to remove. It returns the smallest integer `beg` such that removing exactly `k` edges can result in connected components with sizes at least `beg`, or the last value for which removing `k` edges cannot achieve this if no such `beg` exists.
