The function accepts a tree (an instance of a tree data structure), a vertex `v`, and an integer `x`. It recursively traverses the tree starting from vertex `v`, counts the number of good connected components (where the size of the component is at least `x` after removing some edges), and calculates the total size of the remaining parts of these components. The function returns two values: `good_components`, which represents the total count of such good components, and `remaining_size`, which represents the combined size of the remaining parts of these components.
