Functionality: **The function accepts a tree (an instance of a class representing a tree structure), a starting vertex `s`, and an integer `x` representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. It returns a tuple containing the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at vertex `s`.**
