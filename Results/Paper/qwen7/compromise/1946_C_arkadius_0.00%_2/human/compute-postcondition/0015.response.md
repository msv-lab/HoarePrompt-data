Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`, where `n` is the number of vertices in the tree.
- `k` remains unchanged (its value is not specified, so it's left as `k`).
- `[u, v]` contains the integers `u-1` and `v-1`, which means `u` and `v` are two vertices in the tree.
- The tree now includes all the edges specified by the inputs.
- The root tree has been processed non-recursively starting from vertex 0 with a parent of -1.

The function `func_4(tree, n, k)` is called with these parameters. Since the function name and its implementation are not provided, we cannot determine the exact output of this function call. However, based on the parameters, the function likely processes the tree structure with `n` vertices, and possibly uses `k` and the edge information to perform some operation.

Given the information, the output of the function call will be whatever the function returns. Since the function's behavior is not specified, we can only describe the parameters passed to the function.

Output: **func_4(tree, n, k) (where `tree` is the tree structure with `n` vertices, `n` is the number of vertices, and `k` is an unchanged parameter)**
