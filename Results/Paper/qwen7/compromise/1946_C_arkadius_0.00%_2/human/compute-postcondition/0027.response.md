Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `tree` (an instance of the Tree class), `n` (a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree), and `k` (a positive integer representing the number of edges to remove). It returns the smallest integer `beg` such that `func_3(tree, n, k, beg)` returns `True`, or the last value for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returned `False` if no such `beg` exists.**
