Output State: **stack contains (new_u, True), (u, False)**

Explanation: The code `stack.append((u, False))` appends a new tuple `(u, False)` to the existing stack. Initially, the stack contained `(new_u, True)`. After executing the code, the stack now contains both `(new_u, True)` and `(u, False)`.
