Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` remains unchanged, `[u, v]` contains the integers `u-1` and `v-1` which were provided as input during the last iteration, and the tree now includes all the edges specified by the inputs. The loop has executed `n-1` times, adding each of the `n-1` edges of the tree as per the given inputs.
