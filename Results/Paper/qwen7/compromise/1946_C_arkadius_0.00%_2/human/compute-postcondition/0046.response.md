Output State: The stack will contain a series of tuples where each tuple is of the form (child_vertex, visited_status). Specifically, the stack will contain (new_u, True), (next_u, False), (u, False), and potentially more such tuples depending on the number of children each vertex has. Each child vertex will appear in the stack exactly once before its corresponding visited status changes from False to True, indicating that the postorder traversal has marked it as visited.

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the stack will contain a series of tuples representing vertices and their visited statuses. Each vertex's tuple will initially have the second element as `False`, indicating it hasn't been visited yet, except for the last processed vertex which will have its second element as `True`, indicating it has been visited. The order of these tuples in the stack reflects the order in which the vertices were pushed onto the stack during the loop iterations, following the postorder traversal logic.
