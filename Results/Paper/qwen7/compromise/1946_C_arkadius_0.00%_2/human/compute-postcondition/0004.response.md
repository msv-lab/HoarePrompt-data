Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `tree` is an instance of a custom Tree class that now includes an edge between vertex `u-1` and vertex `v-1`.**

Explanation: The code `tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)` adds an edge between vertices `u-1` and `v-1` in the tree. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and the `tree` object are updated to reflect this addition, while the other variables remain unchanged.
