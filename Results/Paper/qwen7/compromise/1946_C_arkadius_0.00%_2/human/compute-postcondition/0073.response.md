Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components` will count how many of `v`'s descendants have `remaining_size` greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will be the total `remaining_size` of all such descendants, `stack` does not contain `v` and `postorder` is the last element popped from `stack`.**

Explanation: The code `v, postorder = stack.pop()` pops an element from the `stack`, assigning the first element of the popped tuple to `v` and the second element to `postorder`. After popping, the `stack` will no longer contain `v`, and `postorder` will hold the value of the last element that was popped from the `stack`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
