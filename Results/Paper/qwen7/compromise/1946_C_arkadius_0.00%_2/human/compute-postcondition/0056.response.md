Postcondition: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by either 1 or `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, depending on whether `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. `stack` must still contain at least one tuple of the form (child_vertex, False), where child_vertex is a child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**
