Output State: **`beg` is an integer, `end` is greater than `beg`, and `mid` is equal to (`beg` + `end` + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The code reassigns the value of `mid` to (`beg` + `end` + 1) // 2, which is the same expression that was used to initialize `mid`. Therefore, the value of `mid` remains unchanged from its initial value. The conditions that `beg` is an integer, `end` is greater than `beg`, and `mid` is equal to (`beg` + `end` + 1) // 2 still hold true.
