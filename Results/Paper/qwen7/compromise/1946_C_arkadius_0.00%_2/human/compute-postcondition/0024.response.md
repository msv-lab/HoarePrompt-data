Output State: `beg` is greater than or equal to `end`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the condition `beg < end` will no longer be true, meaning `beg` will be greater than or equal to `end`. The exact values of `beg` and `end` depend on the evaluations of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` during each iteration, but the final state will always satisfy `beg >= end`.
