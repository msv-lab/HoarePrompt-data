Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The stack contains tuples where each tuple consists of a vertex from `tree.vertices[v].children` and a boolean value indicating whether the child has been processed (`True`) or not (`False`). Specifically, the stack will include every vertex that can be reached from `v` via its children and their children, and so on, with each vertex's processing status recorded. The condition `postorder` is true.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by either 1 or `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, depending on whether `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. `stack` must still contain at least one tuple of the form (child_vertex, False), where child_vertex is a child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components'` and `tree.vertices[u].good_components'` remains unchanged. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is further increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size'` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by either 1 (if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`) or by `tree.vertices[u].good_components'` (if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`). Additionally, `tree.vertices[u].good_components'` remains unchanged in both cases. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size'` is only increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size'` when `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
