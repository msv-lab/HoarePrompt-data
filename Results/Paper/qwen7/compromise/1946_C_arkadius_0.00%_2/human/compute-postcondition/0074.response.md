Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components` will count how many of `v`'s descendants have `remaining_size` greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will be the total `remaining_size` of all such descendants, `stack` now contains `(v, True)` and `postorder` is the last element popped from `stack`.**

Explanation: The code `stack.append((v, True))` appends a tuple `(v, True)` to the stack. This means that the stack now contains this new tuple along with whatever was previously in the stack. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
