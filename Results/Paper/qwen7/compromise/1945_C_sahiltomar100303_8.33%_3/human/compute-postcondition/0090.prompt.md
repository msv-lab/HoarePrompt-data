Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `rightOne` is equal to the number of '1's in the same substring, `trightZero` is equal to the cumulative count of '0's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, and `trightOne` is equal to the cumulative count of '1's encountered in the same period; additionally, `left` is set to `mid`, `leftMove` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is equal to `n-2` or `n-1`, `rightZero` and `rightOne` represent the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, respectively, `trightZero` and `trightOne` represent the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, `left` is now `mid-1` and must be greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0, `leftOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '1', and `leftOne` remains unchanged if `s[left - 1]` is '0'. The number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]` still satisfies the conditions specified in the precondition.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is equal to `n-2` or `n-1`, `rightZero` and `rightOne` must satisfy the condition `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`, `trightZero` and `trightOne` represent the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, `left` is now `mid-2` and must be greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, and `rightZero` or `rightOne` is increased by 1 depending on whether `s[left - 1]` is '0' or '1'.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is equal to `n-2` or `n-1`, `left` is `mid-3`, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, `rightZero` or `rightOne` is increased by 1 depending on whether `s[mid-3]` is '0' or '1', `rightOne` is increased by 1, and `rightZero` is increased by 1 if `s[mid-3]` is '0'


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
