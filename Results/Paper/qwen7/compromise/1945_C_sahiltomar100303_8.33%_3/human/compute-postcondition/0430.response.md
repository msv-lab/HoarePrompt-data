Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or `n//2`, `rightOne` is either `n//2` or `n//2 + 1`, `rightZero` is `n - leftZero`, `leftOne` is `n - rightOne`, `right` is `mid + 2`, `tleftZero` is equal to `(mid + 1) // 2 + 1`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid - 1) // 2`, and `trightZero` is either `trightZero - 1` or `trightZero` depending on the value of `s[right]`.**

Explanation: The code increments `tleftZero` by 1. Since `tleftZero` was initially less than or equal to `(mid + 1) // 2`, after incrementing by 1, it becomes `(mid + 1) // 2 + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
