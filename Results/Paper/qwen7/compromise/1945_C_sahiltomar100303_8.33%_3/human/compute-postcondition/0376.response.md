Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `rightZero` is increased by `(n - mid)`, and `trightZero` is also increased by `(n - mid)`. Similarly, `rightOne` is increased by `(n - mid)`, and `trightOne` is also increased by `(n - mid)`, `left` is equal to `mid`.**

Explanation: The code `left = mid` assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `left`. The values of `i`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `rightOne`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `i` is still equal to `n`, and `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `rightOne`, and `trightOne` are all increased by `(n - mid)` as described in the precondition. Additionally, `left` is now set to `mid`.
