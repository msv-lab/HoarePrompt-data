Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `right` is no longer `n`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes a new variable `tleftZero` and assigns it the value 0. This does not affect any of the existing variables (`rightZero`, `rightOne`, `right`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`). Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
