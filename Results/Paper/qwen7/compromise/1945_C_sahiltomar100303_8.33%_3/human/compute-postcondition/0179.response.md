Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `mid` must be greater than 1, `leftZero` is increased by 1.**

The code `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` was not previously defined, it is assumed to be 0 initially. After the increment, its value becomes 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and `mid` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
