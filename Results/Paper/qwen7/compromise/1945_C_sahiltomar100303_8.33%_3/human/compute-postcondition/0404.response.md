Postcondition: **`left` is at least 1, `leftZero` is either `leftZero - 1` or remains the same, `rightOne` is either `rightOne + 1` or `rightOne + 2`, and `rightZero` is increased by 1 if `s[left - 1] == '0'`, otherwise `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

This postcondition ensures that the loop condition is maintained, with the appropriate adjustments to `leftZero`, `rightOne`, and `rightZero` based on the value of `s[left - 1]`.
