Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within the string `s` such that `i + 1 < n`, `rightZero` is increased by 1, and `rightOne` is increased by 2 if the character at index `i` is not '0', `trightZero` is increased by 1.**

The code `trightZero += 1` increases the value of `trightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
