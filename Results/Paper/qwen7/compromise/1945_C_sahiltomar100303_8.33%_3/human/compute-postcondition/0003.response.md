Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\) and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user.**

The code `s = input()` assigns the value entered by the user as a string to the variable `s`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
