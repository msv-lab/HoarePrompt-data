Output State: **`right` is less than `n`, `tleftZero` is less than \((\text{right} + 1) // 2\), and `trightOne` is less than \((n - \text{right} + 1) // 2\); `tleftZero` is increased by 1.**

The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. The conditions involving `right`, `n`, `tleftZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged from the initial state.
