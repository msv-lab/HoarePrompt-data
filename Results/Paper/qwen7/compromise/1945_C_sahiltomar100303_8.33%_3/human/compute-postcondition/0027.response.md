Output State: **`i` is 1, `mid` is greater than 1, `leftOne` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` was initially updated by adding 1 to its current value. Given that the initial value of `leftOne` was implicitly 1 (since it was "updated by adding 1"), after executing `tleftOne += 1`, the value of `leftOne` becomes 2. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the given code snippet.
