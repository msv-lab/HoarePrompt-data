Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` will be equal to the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, and `rightOne` will be equal to the number of '1's in the same substring. Additionally, `trightZero` will be equal to the cumulative count of '0's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, and `trightOne` will be equal to the cumulative count of '1's encountered in the same period.

This means that `i` starts at `mid` and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n-1`. For each '0' encountered in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `rightZero` is incremented by 1, and for each '1', `rightOne` is incremented by 1. The variables `trightZero` and `trightOne` keep track of the total counts of '0's and '1's encountered since the loop started, respectively.
