Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or n//2, `rightOne` is either n//2 or n//2 + 1, `rightZero` is n - leftZero, `leftOne` is n - rightOne, `right` is mid + 1, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to (mid + 1) // 2, `trightOne` is less than or equal to (n - mid - 1) // 2 - 1, and `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1**.

The code `trightOne -= 1` decreases the value of `trightOne` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `trightOne` was either `(n - mid - 1) // 2` or `(n - mid - 1) // 2 + 1`. After decrementing, `trightOne` will now be one less than its original value, making it either `(n - mid - 1) // 2 - 1` or `(n - mid - 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
