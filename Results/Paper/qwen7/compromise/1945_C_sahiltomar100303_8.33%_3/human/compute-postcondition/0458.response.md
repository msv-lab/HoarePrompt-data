Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is explicitly given as 0.
- `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `right`, `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, and `trightZero` are described in terms of `n` and other conditions, but their specific values do not affect the print statement `print(left)`.

The print statement `print(left)` will simply print the value of the variable `left`, which is explicitly stated to be 0.

Output: **0**
