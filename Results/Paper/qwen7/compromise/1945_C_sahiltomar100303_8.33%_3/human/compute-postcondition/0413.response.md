Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or n//2 + 1, `rightOne` is either n//2 or n//2 + 1, `rightZero` is n - leftZero, and `leftOne` is n - rightOne; `right` is mid, `tleftZero` is less than (mid + 1) // 2 + 1, `trightOne` is less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, `trightZero` is trightZero - 1.**

The code `trightZero -= 1` decrements the value of `trightZero` by 1. Since `trightZero` was previously defined as being less than `(mid + 1) // 2 + 1`, the new value of `trightZero` will be one less than its original value, but it will still satisfy the condition of being less than `(mid + 1) // 2 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
