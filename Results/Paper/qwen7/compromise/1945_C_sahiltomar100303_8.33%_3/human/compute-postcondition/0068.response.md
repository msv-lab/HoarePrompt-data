Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-2`, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` plus 1, `rightOne` is equal to the number of '1's in the same substring, `trightZero` is equal to the cumulative count of '0's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, `trightOne` is equal to the cumulative count of '1's encountered in the same period, `left` is set to `mid` and must be greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0, the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` is less than \((left + 1) // 2\), the number of '1's in the same substring is less than \((n - left + 1) // 2\), and the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The line `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
