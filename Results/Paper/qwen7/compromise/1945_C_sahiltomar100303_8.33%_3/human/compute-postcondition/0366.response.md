Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(mid, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently `mid`.
   - `n` is the upper limit of the range.
   - If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 1.
   - If `s[i]` is '1', then `rightOne` is increased by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `mid + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be `mid + 1` and `i < n` must hold true.
   - The values of `n`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since no such modification is mentioned, they stay the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now `mid + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `rightZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is `mid + 1`, `n` is the upper limit of the range, `rightZero` is the current value of rightZero, `rightOne` is the current value of rightOne.**
