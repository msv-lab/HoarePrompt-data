Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or `n//2`, `rightOne` is either `n//2` or `n//2 + 1`, `rightZero` is `n - leftZero`, `leftOne` is `n - rightOne`, `right` is `mid + 2`. Depending on the value of `s[right]`, `tleftZero` and `trightOne` will be updated as follows:
- If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is equal to `(mid + 1) // 2 + 1` and `trightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid - 1) // 2`.
- If `s[right]` is not '0', then `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `(mid + 1) // 2` and `trightOne` is equal to `(n - mid - 1) // 2 - 1`. Additionally, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1.**
