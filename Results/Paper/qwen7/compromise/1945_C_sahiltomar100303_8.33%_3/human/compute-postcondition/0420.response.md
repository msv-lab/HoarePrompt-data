Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or n//2, `rightOne` is either n//2 or n//2 + 1, `rightZero` is n - leftZero, and `leftOne` is n - rightOne; `right` is mid + 1, `tleftZero` is either less than or greater than or equal to (mid + 1) // 2, `trightOne` is either less than or greater than or equal to (n - mid + 1) // 2 - 1, and `tleftOne` is either tleftOne or tleftOne + 1.**

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Since `right` was initially `mid`, after executing the code, `right` becomes `mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
