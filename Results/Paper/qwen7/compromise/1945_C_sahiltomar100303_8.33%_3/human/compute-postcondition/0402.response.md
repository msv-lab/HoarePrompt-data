Output State: **`left` is at least 1, `leftZero` is either `leftZero - 1` or remains the same, `rightOne` is either `rightOne + 1` or remains the same, `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `leftOne -= 1` decreases the value of `leftOne` by 1.
- The conditions for the loop to continue (`left > 0` and `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`) are maintained as per the analysis.
- `left` is at least 1, ensuring the loop can continue.
- `leftZero` can either decrease by 1 or stay the same.
- `rightOne` can either increase by 1 or stay the same.
