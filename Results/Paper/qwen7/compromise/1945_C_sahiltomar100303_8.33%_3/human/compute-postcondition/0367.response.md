Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the range for `i` as `range(mid, n)`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `mid`.
   - `n` is the upper limit of the range.
   - If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 1.
   - Otherwise, `rightOne` is increased by 1.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `mid` and the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `mid + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` will be `mid + 1` and it needs to be less than `n`.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to `mid + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range.
   - The conditions for updating `rightZero` and `rightOne` remain the same based on the value of `s[i]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` is the upper limit of the range, if `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `rightOne` is increased by 1.**
