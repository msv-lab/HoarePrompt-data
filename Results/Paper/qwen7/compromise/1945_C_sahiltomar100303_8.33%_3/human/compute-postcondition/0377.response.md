Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `rightZero` is increased by `(n - mid)`, and `trightZero` is also increased by `(n - mid)`. Similarly, `rightOne` is increased by `(n - mid)`, and `trightOne` is also increased by `(n - mid)`, `left` is equal to `mid`, `leftMove` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `leftMove` to 0. None of the other variables (`i`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightOne`, `left`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
