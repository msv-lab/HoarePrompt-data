Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` and `rightOne` represent the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]` starting from index `mid` to `right`, `trightZero` and `trightOne` represent the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, `left` is now `0`, `leftMove` is `0`, and `leftOne` is either `0` or `1`, depending on whether the last character `s[right]` was '0' or '1', `right` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description. The condition regarding the cumulative counts (`tleftZero < (mid + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - mid + 1) // 2`) still holds true.
