Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must satisfy `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is now `rightOne + 1`, and `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other conditions and constraints remain the same as the initial state. Therefore, `left` must still be greater than 0, `leftZero` must still satisfy `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2`, and `leftOne` is still `leftOne - 1`. The only change is that `rightOne` is now one more than its previous value.
