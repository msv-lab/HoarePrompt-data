Output State: **t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), the value of `t` is updated to the integer input provided by the user, while the constraints on `t` remain the same. All other variables (`n` and `a`) are not affected by this code snippet.
