Output State: **`leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0**

Explanation: The line `tleftZero = 0` assigns the value 0 to the new variable `tleftZero`. This does not affect the values of the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged.
