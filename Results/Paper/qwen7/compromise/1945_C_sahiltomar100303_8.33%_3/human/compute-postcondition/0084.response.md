Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-2` or `n-1`, `left` is `mid-2`, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, `rightZero` is increased by 1, `rightOne` is unchanged, `leftZero` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
