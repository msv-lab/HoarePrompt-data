Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `right` is no longer `n`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `trightZero`. Since `trightZero` is just a temporary variable and not used elsewhere in the provided code snippet, its assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
