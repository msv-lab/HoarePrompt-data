Output State: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, `rightOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, and `leftOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0. The variable `right` equals `n`, and `mid`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `left` will be 0 because the loop continues as long as `left > 0`. At this point, `right` will be equal to `n` since the loop increments `right` until it reaches `n`. The counts of zeros and ones (`leftZero`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `leftOne`) will reflect the cumulative counts of zeros and ones encountered from the right as `left` decreases to 0. The other variables (`mid`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`) will retain their values from the initial state since they are not modified within the loop.
