Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` and `rightOne` represent the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, respectively, `trightZero` and `trightOne` represent the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, `left` is now `0`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftOne` is `0`, and `right` is `mid`, the current value of `s[right]` is '0', and either `tleftZero < (mid + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - mid + 1) // 2`**.
