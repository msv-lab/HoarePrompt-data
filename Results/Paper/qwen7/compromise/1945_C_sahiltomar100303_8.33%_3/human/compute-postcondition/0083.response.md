Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-2` or `n-1`, `left` is `mid-2`, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, `rightZero` or `rightOne` is increased by 1 depending on whether `s[left - 1]` is '0' or '1', `leftZero` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `leftZero -= 1` decreases the value of `leftZero` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
