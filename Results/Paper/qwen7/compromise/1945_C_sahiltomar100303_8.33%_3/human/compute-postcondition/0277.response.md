Output State: **`right` is incremented by 1 and is now less than `n`; `tleftZero` is less than \((\text{right} + 1) // 2\) and either increased by 1 or remains the same; `trightOne` is less than \((n - \text{right} + 1) // 2\) and either decreased by 1 or remains the same; and `tleftOne` is equal to \((\text{right} + 1) // 2 + 1\) if the condition `s[right] == '0'` is true, otherwise it remains as \((\text{right} + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Since `right` was previously less than `n` and incremented by 1, it is now less than `n`. The conditions for `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, and `tleftOne` remain unchanged because they depend on the value of `right`, which has now increased by 1. Therefore, the updated conditions apply to the new value of `right`.
