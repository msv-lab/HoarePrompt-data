Postcondition: `left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must satisfy `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` and can either be `leftZero - 1` or remain the same, `rightOne` must satisfy `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` and can either be `rightOne + 1` or remain the same, `rightZero` is increased by 1 if `s[left - 1] == '0'`, and `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1` if `s[left - 1] != '0'`.
