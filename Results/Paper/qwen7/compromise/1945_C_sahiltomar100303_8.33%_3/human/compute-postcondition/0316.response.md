Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, `rightOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, `leftOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0, `right` is equal to `n` or less than `n`, `mid`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged, `s` is the input string.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value of the input string, which is read using `input()`. The values of `left`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `leftOne`, `right`, `mid`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them within the given code snippet.
