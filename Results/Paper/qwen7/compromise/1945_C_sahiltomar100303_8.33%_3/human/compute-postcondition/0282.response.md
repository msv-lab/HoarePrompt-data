Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is 0.
- `leftZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0. Since `left` is already 0, `leftZero` would be the count of zeros up to this point, which is 0.
- `rightZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0. Again, since `left` is 0, `rightZero` would be the count of zeros from the current position to the end, which is also 0.
- `rightOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0. Similarly, since `left` is 0, `rightOne` would be the count of ones from the current position to the end, which is 0.
- `leftOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0. Since `left` is 0, `leftOne` would be the count of ones up to this point, which is 0.
- `right` is not equal to `n`.
- `mid`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged.
- The condition `left == 0` is true.

The `print(right)` statement will print the value of `right`.

Output: **right (where right is not equal to n)**
