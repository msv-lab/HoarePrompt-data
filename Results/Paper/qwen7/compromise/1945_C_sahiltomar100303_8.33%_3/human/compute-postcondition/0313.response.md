Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, `rightOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, `leftOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0, `right` is equal to `n` or less than `n`, `mid`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged, and either `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n + 1) // 2` is true, and if `right` equals `n` and `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` plus one, `tleftZero` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `left` and half of `n+1` is adjusted such that it is either less than or equal to the absolute difference between `right` and half of `n+1`, or greater than the absolute difference between `right` and half of `n+1`.**
