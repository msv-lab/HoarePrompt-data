Postcondition: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or `n//2`, `rightOne` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is `n - leftZero`, `leftOne` is `n - rightOne`, `right` is `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `(n - 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - 1 - (n - 1) // 2) // 2`, and the condition `right == n` is true.
