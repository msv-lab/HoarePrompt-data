Output State: **`right` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`, and either `tleftZero` or `trightOne` must meet the condition `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)`, `trightOne` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `trightOne -= 1` decrements the value of `trightOne` by 1. The conditions involving `tleftZero` and `trightOne` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the decrement of `trightOne` while keeping the other conditions and increments of `right` and `tleftOne` intact.
