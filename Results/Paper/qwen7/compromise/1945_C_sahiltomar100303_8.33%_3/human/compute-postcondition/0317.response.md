Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, `rightOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, `leftOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0, `right` is equal to `n` or less than `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged, `s` is the input string.**

Explanation: The variable `mid` is assigned the value of `n // 2`, which is the integer division of `n` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
