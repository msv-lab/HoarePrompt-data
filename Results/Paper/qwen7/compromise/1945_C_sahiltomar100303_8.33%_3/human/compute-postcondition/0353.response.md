Output State: **`i` is equal to `mid - 1`, `n` is the upper limit of the range, and `rightZero` is increased by 1 to its new value, and the current value of `s[i]` is '0'.**

The code `trightZero += 1` increases the value of `rightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
