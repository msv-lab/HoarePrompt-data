Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is now (`leftZero` - 1), `rightOne` must be less than (n - left + 1) // 2, the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0'**.

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1. All other conditions and constraints remain the same. The value of `left` is still greater than 0, `leftZero` is updated to its new value, `rightOne` is still less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`, and the character at `s[left - 1]` remains '0'.
