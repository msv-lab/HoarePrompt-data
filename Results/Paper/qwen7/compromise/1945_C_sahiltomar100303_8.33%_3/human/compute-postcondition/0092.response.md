Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` and `rightOne` represent the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, respectively, `trightZero` and `trightOne` represent the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, `left` is now `0`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftOne` is `0`, and `right` is `mid`.**

Explanation: The code `right = mid` simply assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `right`. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `i`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `left`, `leftMove`, and `leftOne` remain unchanged from their previous states.
