Output State: **`i` is `mid + 2`, `n` must be greater than `mid + 2`, `rightOne` is increased by 2**.

Explanation: The variable `trightOne` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. Since `trightOne` was initially increased by 1 before this line of code, it is now increased by 2 in total. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
