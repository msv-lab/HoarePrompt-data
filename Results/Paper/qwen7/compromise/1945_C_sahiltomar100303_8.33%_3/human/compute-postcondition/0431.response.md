Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or `n//2`, `rightOne` is either `n//2` or `n//2 + 1`, `rightZero` is `n - leftZero`, `leftOne` is `n - rightOne`, `right` is `mid + 2`, `tleftZero` is equal to `(mid + 1) // 2 + 1`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid - 1) // 2`, `trightZero` is `trightZero - 1`**.

The variable `trightZero` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `trightZero` is now one less than its previous value, but the exact new value depends on the original value of `trightZero`.
