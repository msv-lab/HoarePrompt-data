Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or `n//2`, `rightOne` is either `n//2` or `n//2 + 1`, `rightZero` is `n - leftZero`, `leftOne` is `n - rightOne`, `right` is `mid + 2`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `(mid + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is equal to `(n - mid - 1) // 2 - 1`, `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `trightOne -= 1` decrements the value of `trightOne` by 1. Since `trightOne` was initially either less than or equal to `(n - mid - 1) // 2`, after decrementing, its new value is `(n - mid - 1) // 2 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
