Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, `rightOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, `leftOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0, `right` is equal to `n` or less than `n`, `mid`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the user's input to the variable `n`. The values of `left`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `leftOne`, `right`, `mid`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged. The condition involving `rightOne` and the adjustment of `tleftZero` based on the absolute differences also remains unchanged.
