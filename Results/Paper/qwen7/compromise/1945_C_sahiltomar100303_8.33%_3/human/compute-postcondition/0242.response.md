Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must be less than (left + 1) // 2, `rightOne` must be less than (n - left + 1) // 2, `leftOne` is decreased by 1**.

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is decremented by 1. Since `leftOne` was originally greater than or equal to 0 (as implied by the precondition that `left` must be greater than 0), it is now one less than its original value. The preconditions on `leftZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the operation on `leftOne`.
