Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` and `rightOne` represent the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, respectively, `trightZero` and `trightOne` represent the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, `left` is now `0` (since it starts from `mid` and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0), `leftMove` is 0, `leftOne` is decreased by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0 (if it was initially greater than 0), and both `rightZero` and `rightOne` are increased by the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]` as the loop progresses.

This means that after all iterations, `left` will be 0, indicating that we have checked all characters from `mid` to the beginning of the string. The counts of `rightZero` and `rightOne` will reflect the total number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]`. The cumulative counts `trightZero` and `trightOne` will include all the '0's and '1's encountered during the loop, and `leftOne` will be 0 if it was reduced to 0 during the iterations.
