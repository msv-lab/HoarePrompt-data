Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `rightOne` is equal to the number of '1's in the same substring, `trightZero` is equal to the cumulative count of '0's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, `trightOne` is equal to the cumulative count of '1's encountered in the same period, `left` is set to `mid` and must be greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, and the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` is less than \((left + 1) // 2\) and the number of '1's in the same substring is less than \((n - left + 1) // 2\), but `s[left - 1]` is not '0'.**

Explanation: The code `leftOne -= 1` decreases the value of `leftOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
