Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `mid` to `n` (inclusive), so the loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a string.
   - `i` is an index within the string `s`.
   - `rightZero` is increased by 2 if the character at index `i` is '0'.
   - `rightOne` is increased by 2 if the character at index `i` is not '0'.

4. **Analyze the loop increment**: The loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration.

5. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an index within the string `s`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `rightZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged because they depend on the characters within the string `s` and the current value of `i`, which changes.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within the string `s` such that `i + 1 < n`, `rightZero` is increased by 2 if the character at index `i` is '0', and `rightOne` is increased by 2 if the character at index `i` is not '0'**.
