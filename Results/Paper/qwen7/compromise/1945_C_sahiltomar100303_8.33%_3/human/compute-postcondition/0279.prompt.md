Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop will continue to execute as long as `left > 0` and the condition `(leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2)` holds true. After all iterations, `left` will be 0, `leftZero` will be the total number of zeros encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0, `rightZero` will be the total number of zeros encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, `rightOne` will be the total number of ones encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, and `leftOne` will be the total number of ones encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0. `right` is set to `mid`, and all other variables (`mid`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`) will remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `right` is less than `n`, `trightZero` is decreased by 1 if `s[right-1]` is '0', otherwise `trightOne` is decreased by 1 and `tleftOne` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `right` is less than `n`, `tleftZero` is less than \((\text{right} + 1) // 2\), `tleftOne` is either equal to \((\text{right} + 1) // 2 - 1\) or increased by 1, and `trightOne` is either less than \((n - \text{right} + 1) // 2\) or decreased by 1; `right` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `right` is incremented by 1 and is now less than `n`; `tleftZero` is less than \((\text{right} + 1) // 2\) and either increased by 1 or remains the same; `trightOne` is less than \((n - \text{right} + 1) // 2\) and either decreased by 1 or remains the same; and `tleftOne` is equal to \((\text{right} + 1) // 2 + 1\) if the condition `s[right] == '0'` is true, otherwise it remains as \((\text{right} + 1) // 2


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
