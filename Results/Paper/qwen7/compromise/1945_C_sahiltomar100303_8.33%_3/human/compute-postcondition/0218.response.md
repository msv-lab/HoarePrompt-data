Output State: **`leftMove` is 0, `left` is equal to `mid`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne` remain unchanged, `rightZero` and `trightZero` remain unchanged, `rightOne` and `trightOne` remain unchanged, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and both `mid` and `n` retain their initial values.**

Explanation: The line `leftMove = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `leftMove`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `left`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightOne`, `i`, `mid`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
