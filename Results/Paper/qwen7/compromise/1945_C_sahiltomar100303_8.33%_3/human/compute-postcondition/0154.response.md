Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `right` is `n`, `rightZero` and `rightOne` represent the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `trightZero` and `trightOne` represent the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, `left` is `0`, `leftMove` is `0`, and `leftOne` is `0` because the loop does not affect it further. The condition `left == 0` remains false. Additionally, the condition `right == n` is true, and the condition `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)` holds true if the else part is executed, while `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) > abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)` holds true if the if part is executed.**
