Output State: **Postcondition: `c` is decreased by 3, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, and `cntl[2]` is less than 2. If `c` is falsy or `j` equals `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

In this output state, the loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `c` has been decreased by 3 from its initial value. The variable `j` is 3 because the loop runs from 1 to `n` inclusive, and it has completed 3 iterations. For the loop to run 3 times, `n` must be greater than 2. Additionally, `cntl[2]` must be less than 2 for the loop to continue running without breaking prematurely. If `c` becomes falsy (i.e., 0 or a value considered false in a boolean context) or if `j` equals `n`, the loop will exit.
