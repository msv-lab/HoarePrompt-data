Output State: **`c` is decreased by 2, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `cntl[2]` is less than 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Given the initial conditions, these remain unchanged except for the fact that we have exited the loop or conditional structure.
