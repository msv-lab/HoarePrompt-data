Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the constant `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being set to 1 (since the range is `range(1, n + 1)`).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Initial State of `cntl[0]`**: Given that `cntl[0]` is not 0, we know that `cntl[0]` is some positive integer.

5. **Initial State of `c`**: `c` is defined as the minimum value between 2 and `cntl[0]`. Since `cntl[0]` is not 0, `c` will be either 2 or `cntl[0]` if `cntl[0]` is greater than 2.

6. **Adjusting the States**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`. We need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. This means `n` should be a positive integer and `j` should start from 1.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states of `j` and `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
- `j` is 1
- `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0)

Since `cntl[0]` is not 0 and `c` is derived from `cntl[0]`, we don't need to explicitly mention `c` in the state adjustment because its value is determined by `cntl[0]`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0)**
