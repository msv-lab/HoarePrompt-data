Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `a` contains at least one element.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cntl[i]` is increased by 1 (this is not directly relevant to the loop condition).
   - `a` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `a` contains at least one element, for the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still contain at least one element.
   - The variable `i` is not directly relevant to the loop condition, but it will be set to the next element in `a` during the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - The state of `cntl[i]` does not need to be adjusted since it is not part of the loop condition.
   - The state of `a` must remain such that it contains at least one element.
   - The value of `i` will change during the next iteration, but its current state is not relevant to the loop condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `cntl[i]` is increased by 1, `a` must contain at least one element**
