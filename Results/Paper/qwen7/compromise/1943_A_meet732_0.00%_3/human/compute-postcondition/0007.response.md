Output State: **`cntl[i]` is increased by 1, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. The value of `i` remains `i + 1` as it was not reassigned or altered in the given code snippet. Therefore, `cntl[i]` is increased by 1, and `i` is still `i + 1`.
