Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State: 
   - `j` is explicitly set to 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `c` is decreased by 1, but its initial value is not provided.
   - Either `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`.

2. Since `j` is explicitly set to 1, we know the value of `j` when the `print(j)` statement is executed.

3. The value of `n` does not affect the execution of `print(j)` because `j` is already known and does not depend on `n`.

4. The condition involving `c` (either `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`) is not relevant to the `print(j)` statement, as it only outputs the value of `j`.

Therefore, the `print(j)` statement will simply print the value of `j`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
