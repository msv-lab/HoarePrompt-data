Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `a`.
3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cntl[i]` is increased by 1.
   - `a` must contain at least one element.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `a` must still contain at least one element.
   - The value of `i` used in the current iteration is the next element in the list `a`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `a` still contains at least one element.
   - The variable `i` is not directly modified within the loop head; it is an iterator over the elements of `a`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `a` must still contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cntl[i]` is increased by 1, `a` must contain at least one element**
