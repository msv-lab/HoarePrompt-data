Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the constant `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being set to 1 (since the loop is defined as `for j in range(1, n + 1)`).

3. **Determine the State of `n`**: The value of `n` directly affects whether the loop will execute. If `n` is less than 1, the loop will not execute.

4. **Consider the `cntl` List**: The initial state of `cntl` is given as `cntl[0]` being decremented by the minimum of 2 or its current value. However, since the loop does not directly modify `cntl`, we do not need to adjust the state of `cntl` itself, but rather focus on the conditions under which the loop can execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- The variable `j` should be set to 1 (the starting value of the loop).
- The variable `n` should be such that the loop can execute, meaning `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
