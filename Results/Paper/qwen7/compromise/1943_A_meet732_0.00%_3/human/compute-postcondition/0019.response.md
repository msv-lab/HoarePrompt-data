Output State: **`c` is decreased by 1, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `cntl[j]` is less than 2.**

The code `c -= 1` decreases the value of `c` by 1. Since `j` was previously set to 1 and the conditions for `n` and `cntl[j]` remain unchanged, the updated state includes `c` being decreased by 1 while keeping the other variables and their conditions intact.
