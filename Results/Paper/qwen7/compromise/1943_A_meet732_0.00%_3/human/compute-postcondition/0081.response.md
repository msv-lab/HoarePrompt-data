Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(1, n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 2
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `c` is -1
   - Additional conditions: if `c` is -1 and `j` equals `n`, or if `c` is False (or 0), the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Given `j` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `j` is 2, it will increment to 3 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `j` will be 3 in the next iteration.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - The value of `c` remains -1 as no information suggests it changes within the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `c` is -1**
