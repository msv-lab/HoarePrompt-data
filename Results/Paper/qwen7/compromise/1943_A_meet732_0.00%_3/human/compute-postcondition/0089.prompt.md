Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cntl[0]` is incremented by the number of times 0 appears in `a`; for each index `i` in the list `a`, `cntl[i]` is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`; `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`; all other variables (`j`, `n`, and `a`) retain their final values from after the loop has completed its iterations.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        c -= 1
        if not c or j == n:
            print(j)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 0, and the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is -1, and if `c` is -1 and `j` equals `n`, or if `c` is False (or 0), the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `c` is -2, and if `cntl[j]` is less than 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
