Output State: **`c` is decreased by 3, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, and `cntl[2]` is less than 2**

Explanation: The value of `c` is decreased by 1 due to the operation `c -= 1`. Initially, `c` was decreased by 2, so now it is decreased by a total of 3. The values of `j`, `n`, and `cntl[2]` remain unchanged.
