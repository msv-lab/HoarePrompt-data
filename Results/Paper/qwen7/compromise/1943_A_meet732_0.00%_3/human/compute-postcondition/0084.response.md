Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `c` is -2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `j`, `n`, and `c`. It only causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of `j`, `n`, and `c` remain unchanged.
