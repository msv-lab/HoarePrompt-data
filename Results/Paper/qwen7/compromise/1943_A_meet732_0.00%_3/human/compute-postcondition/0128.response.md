Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 3.
- `cntl[2]` is less than 2, but this does not affect the value of `j` or the output of the `print(j)` statement.
- `c` is equal to the original value of `c` minus 1, but since `c` is not used in the `print(j)` statement and no explicit value for `c` is given, it does not impact the output.

The `print(j)` statement will simply print the value of `j`.

Output: **3**
