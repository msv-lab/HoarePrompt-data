Output State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `n` is the integer value entered by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `cntl` with `n + 1` elements, each set to 0. The length of `cntl` is `n + 1`, and since all elements are initialized to 0, the list `cntl` now contains `n + 1` zeros. The values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
