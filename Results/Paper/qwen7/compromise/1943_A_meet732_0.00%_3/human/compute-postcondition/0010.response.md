Output State: The `cntl` list will be updated such that each index `i` (where `i` is an element in the list `a`) will have its corresponding value incremented by the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`.

In other words, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `cntl` list will show the frequency count of each integer present in the list `a`.
