Output State: The `cntl` list will be updated such that each index `i` (where `i` is an element in the list `a`) will have a value equal to the number of times `i` appears in `a`. The `cntl` list will have a length of `n + 1`, where `n` is the maximum value in the list `a`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `cntl` list will show how many times each number in the original list `a` appeared.
