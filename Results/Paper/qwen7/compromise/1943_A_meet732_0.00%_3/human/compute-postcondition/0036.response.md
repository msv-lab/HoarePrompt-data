Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `j` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so it will become 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than or equal to 1 but must now be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`c` is decreased by 2, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, and `cntl[2]` is less than 2**
