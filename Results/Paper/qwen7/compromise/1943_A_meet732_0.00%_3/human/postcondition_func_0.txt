The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers. For each test case, it calculates the frequency of each integer in the list \( a \) and determines the smallest index \( i \) (greater than 0) where the frequency of \( i \) is less than 2. If no such index exists, it prints \( n \). The function outputs the result for each test case.
