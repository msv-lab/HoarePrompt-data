Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`; `s` is a sorted list containing all elements from the list `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning.**

Explanation: The code `s = [0] + s` prepends the value `0` to the list `s`. Since `s` was initially a sorted list containing all elements from the list `arr`, after the operation, `s` will be a sorted list with `0` added at the beginning. The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still equal to `n`.
