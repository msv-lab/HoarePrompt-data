Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `s` contains `arr[0]`**

The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[0]` (since `i` is 0) to the set `s`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 0 and `i` is still 0. The set `s` now contains the element `arr[0]`.
