Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `s` is a set containing the element `arr[i]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Since `s` was initially an empty set, after adding `arr[i]`, `s` now contains the element `arr[i]`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `ans`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
