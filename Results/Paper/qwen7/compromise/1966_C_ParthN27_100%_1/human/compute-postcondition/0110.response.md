Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a sorted list of all unique elements from the list `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the list `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`i`, `s`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. Since `s` is a sorted list of all unique elements from the list `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, the length of `s` is assigned to `n`.
