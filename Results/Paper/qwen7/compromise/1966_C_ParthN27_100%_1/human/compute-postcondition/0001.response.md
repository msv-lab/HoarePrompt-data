Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. Since no specific input value is provided, the state of `n` is described as "an input integer," indicating that `n` holds the integer value of whatever input was given by the user. All other variables remain in their initial state, which in this case means they are not defined.
