Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set `s`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `arr`, so they remain as described in the initial state. The new variable `s` is now an empty set.
