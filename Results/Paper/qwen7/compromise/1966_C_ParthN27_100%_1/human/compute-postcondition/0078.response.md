Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is greater than 1; `ans` is 1 if `ans` was 0 before, else `ans` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated using the XOR bitwise operator (`^=`) with the value 1. This means if `ans` was 0 before, it will become 1 (since 0 ^ 1 = 1), and if `ans` was 1 before, it will become 0 (since 1 ^ 1 = 0). The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
