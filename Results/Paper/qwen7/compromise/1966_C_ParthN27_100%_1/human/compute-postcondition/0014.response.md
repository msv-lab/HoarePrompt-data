Output State: **`n` is equal to or greater than 4; `i` is equal to `n`; `s` is a list containing `[0]` followed by the sorted elements of `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`.**

Explanation: The code `s = [0] + s` prepends the value `0` to the list `s`. Since `s` originally contained the sorted elements of `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, after the operation, `s` will start with `0` followed by those elements. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
