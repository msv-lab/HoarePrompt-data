Output State: The value of `i` is 4, `n` is equal to the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by the sorted elements of `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, and `ans` is the result of performing XOR operation on 1 for each iteration where `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is not greater than 1.

Explanation: Since the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-2`, and given that the loop has executed 3 times up to `i = 3`, it means that the loop will continue until `i` reaches `n-2`. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`. Given that `n` is not equal to 2, `i` will indeed be `n-1` which is 4 in this case. The variable `ans` will be the result of performing XOR operation on 1 for each iteration where the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] <= 1` holds true.
