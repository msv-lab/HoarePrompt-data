Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3; `i` is 3; `s` contains `arr[3]`**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Given that `i` is 3, the set `s` now contains the element `arr[3]`. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
