Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the length of `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is specified, the `break` statement is effectively breaking out of the context in which it was placed, which could be an implied loop or conditional structure. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition involving `s[i] - s[i - 1]` remain unchanged.
