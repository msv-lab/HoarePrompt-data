Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `s` contains `arr[1]`**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Initially, `i` is 1, so `s` contains `arr[0]`. After executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1 (assuming `i += 1` is somewhere in the surrounding code), making `i` equal to 2. Therefore, `s` now contains `arr[1]`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
