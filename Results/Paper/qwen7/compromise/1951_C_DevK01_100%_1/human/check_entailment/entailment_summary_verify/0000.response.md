### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets over `n` days, with the constraint that we can buy at most `m` tickets per day. The cost of tickets increases linearly after each purchase. We need to ensure that the program correctly handles all edge cases, including when `k` exceeds `n * m`.

#### Function Summary:
The function `func()` processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads two lists of integers `L` and `M`.
2. Extracts `n`, `m`, and `k` from `L`.
3. Ensures `m` is not greater than `k`.
4. Sorts the list `M`.
5. Calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`.
6. Selects the first `q` elements from the sorted list `M`.
7. Computes the cost based on specific conditions.
8. Prints the calculated cost for each test case.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `k` exceeds `n * m`. This is a valid concern, but let's verify if the program indeed fails in such scenarios.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Sorting and Selection:**
   - The program sorts the list `M` and selects the first `q` elements, where `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. This ensures that the most expensive tickets are considered first, which is a reasonable approach to minimize cost.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the cost in two parts:
     - If `n * m == k`, it directly calculates the cost.
     - Otherwise, it handles the remaining tickets by popping the last element and calculating the additional cost.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program does attempt to handle the case where `k` exceeds `n * m` by distributing the remaining tickets across the days. However, the logic for handling this case seems incomplete and potentially incorrect.

4. **Test Case Verification:**
   - Let's verify the provided test case:
     ```
     1
     5 100 101
     1 1 1 1 1
     ```
   - Expected output: `101`
   - Actual output: `10201`
   - The program fails here because it incorrectly calculates the cost. The correct approach should be to distribute the tickets in a way that minimizes the total cost, considering the increasing prices.

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly handle the edge case where `k` exceeds `n * m`. The current implementation has logical flaws that lead to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it fails to handle the edge case where `k` exceeds `n * m` correctly.
