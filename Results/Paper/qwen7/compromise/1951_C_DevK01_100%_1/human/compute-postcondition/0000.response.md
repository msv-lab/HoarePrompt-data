Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. All other variables (n, m, k, and a) remain in their initial state as defined in the precondition.**

This means that `t` now holds the value entered by the user, constrained between 1 and 10^4, while `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` retain their initial conditions specified in the initial state.
