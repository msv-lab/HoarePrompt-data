Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: According to the given information, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and it is guaranteed that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer input, and it is guaranteed to be between 1 and \(10^4\), it will always be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `t` is set to a valid value that allows the loop to execute. Given the constraints, `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being a positive integer within the range [1, \(10^4\)].

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
