Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

In the second sample, depicted below, there is no way to change the radii of
the disks in the desired manner.

    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will have incremented to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The `nodes` list will reflect any nodes that were visited during the DFS calls within the loop, but it will be empty if no nodes were visited. The values of `c0` and `c1` will be updated based on the sum of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` for all visited nodes, respectively. The `ok` variable will be True if there was at least one node with `coef1[j]` not equal to 0, otherwise, it will remain unchanged from its initial value.
    if ok :
        print('YES')

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and two lists `x` and `y` of length `n` containing integers, representing the x and y coordinates of the centers of disks, and a list `r` of length `n` containing integers representing the radii of the disks. It then performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the disks to determine if there exists at least one disk where the coefficient `coef1` is non-zero. If such a disk is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but modifies the `visited` and `coef0`, `coef1` lists during its execution.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of disks, x is a list of integers representing the x-coordinates of the centers of the disks, y is a list of integers representing the y-coordinates of the centers of the disks, r is a list of integers representing the radii of the disks, and visited is a boolean list of length n indicating whether each disk has been visited or not.
def dfs(i):
    if (not visited[i]) :
        visited[i] = True

                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)
            
        #State: Output State: All disks (i.e., for every index `j` from 0 to `n-1`) will have their `visited[j]` value set to True. The values of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body: if the distance condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` is met and `visited[j]` was False before, then `coef0[j]` will be set to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j]` will be set to `-coef1[i]`. If the condition is not met or `visited[j]` was already True, the values of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` will remain unchanged. The variable `j` will take on all values from 0 to `n-1` during the iterations, and the `dfs(j)` function will be called if the distance condition is met and `visited[j]` is False.
        #
        #In summary, after the loop completes, every disk will have been visited, and the `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` values will reflect the conditions under which they were updated during the iterations.
    #State: All disks will have their `visited[j]` value set to True. For every index `j` from 0 to `n-1`, if the distance condition `(r[i] + r[j])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from disk `i`. It marks all disks as visited and updates the `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` values for each disk `j` that is within the radius of disk `i` and has not been visited yet. After the function concludes, all disks will have been visited, and the `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` values will reflect the conditions under which they were updated during the DFS traversal.
