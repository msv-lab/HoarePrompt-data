Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` and `dfs` functions do not properly handle the conditions necessary to determine if the radii can be adjusted as described.

To illustrate why this program is incorrect, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
4
2 2 2
7 2 3
7 7 2
2 7 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

However, the current implementation will incorrectly output `YES`. This happens because the program does not correctly check if the sum of the new radii can strictly decrease while maintaining tangency between disks.

Here's why the current implementation fails:
1. The `dfs` function only checks for tangency and updates coefficients based on the tangency condition. It does not ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases.
2. The logic to check if the sum of the new radii can decrease is missing. The program should calculate the new radii and verify if their sum is strictly less than the original sum while maintaining tangency.

A correct approach would involve:
- Calculating the new radii for each disk based on the tangency condition.
- Ensuring that the sum of the new radii is strictly less than the original sum.
- Verifying that no two disks overlap after the adjustment.

Since the current implementation does not handle these conditions correctly, it fails to produce the correct output for certain inputs, making the program incorrect.
