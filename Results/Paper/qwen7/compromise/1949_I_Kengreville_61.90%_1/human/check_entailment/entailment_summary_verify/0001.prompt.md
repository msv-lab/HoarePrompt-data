You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []
    for i in range(n):
        (x[i], y[i], r[i]) = map(int, input().split())

    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
    if ok:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

#Function 2:
def dfs(i):
    if not visited[i]:
        visited[i] = True
        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from disk `i`. It marks all disks as visited and updates the `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` values for each disk `j` that is within the radius of disk `i` and has not been visited yet. After the function concludes, all disks will have been visited, and the `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` values will reflect the conditions under which they were updated during the DFS traversal.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can adjust the radii of the disks such that:
     - Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent.
     - No two disks overlap.
     - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `dfs`.
   - `func_1` initializes variables and reads input.
   - `dfs` performs a depth-first search (DFS) to explore connected components of tangent disks.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The DFS function checks for tangency between disks using the condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`.
   - It updates coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) to ensure the tangency condition is maintained.
   - The main logic in `func_1` iterates through each disk, performs DFS, and checks if any valid adjustments can be made.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The DFS function correctly identifies pairs of tangent disks.
   - The coefficients are updated to maintain tangency while potentially decreasing the sum of radii.
   - The main loop in `func_1` ensures that all connected components are checked.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where disks are tangent and checks if the sum of radii can be decreased.
   - It correctly prints "YES" if a valid adjustment is found and "NO" otherwise.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to check if the radii of the disks can be adjusted as required. It handles the tangency conditions and the requirement for the sum of radii to decrease.

### Correctness:

**True**
