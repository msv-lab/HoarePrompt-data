Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `nodes` is a non-empty list, `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`; `c1` is increased by `1` for each element `j` in `nodes`; `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged; `coef0[i]` is 0; `coef1[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The condition that `n` is greater than 2 remains unchanged.
- The `nodes` list remains non-empty.
- The value of `c0` is updated by adding `coef0[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`.
- The value of `coef1[i]` is set to 1.
- The value of `c1` is updated by adding 1 for each element `j` in `nodes`.
- The value of `ok` is determined by whether `c1` is not equal to 0. Since `coef1[i]` is set to 1, `c1` will be increased by at least 1, making `ok` True unless `c1` was already 0 (which would not be the case since `coef1[i]` is added).
- The value of `coef0[i]` remains 0.
