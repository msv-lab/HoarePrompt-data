Output State: **`nodes` is an empty list but must contain at least one element; `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]`.**

Explanation: The code `c1 += coef1[j]` increments the value of `c1` by the value of `coef1[j]`. The variable `nodes` is not affected by this operation, so it remains an empty list but must contain at least one element.
