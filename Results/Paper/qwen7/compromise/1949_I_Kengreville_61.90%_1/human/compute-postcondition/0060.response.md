Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `nodes` is a non-empty list.
   - `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`.
   - `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`.
   - `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.

3. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`. Since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.

5. **Keep other states unchanged**: The states related to `nodes`, `c0`, `c1`, and `ok` remain the same as they are not directly affected by the loop head variables `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `nodes` is a non-empty list, `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`; `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`; `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.**
