Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nodes` is an empty list but must contain at least one element.
   - `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in nodes:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `j` in the list `nodes`.
   - For the loop to execute, `nodes` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `nodes` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute, and it is currently an empty list, `nodes` cannot be empty for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `nodes` must be modified to contain at least one element.
   - The variable `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` during each iteration, but since the loop body is omitted, we don't know exactly how many times the loop has run or what specific elements `j` has taken.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `nodes` must be adjusted to contain at least one element.
   - The value of `c1` will depend on the elements in `nodes` during the iterations, but since we don't know the exact number of iterations or the values of `j`, we can only ensure that `nodes` contains at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`nodes` is a list containing at least one element, `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`**.
