Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `nodes` is a non-empty list, `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`; `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`; `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged; `coef0[i]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `coef0[i] = 0` sets the value of `coef0[i]` to 0. Since `i` is 2, `coef0[2]` is now 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from their initial state.
