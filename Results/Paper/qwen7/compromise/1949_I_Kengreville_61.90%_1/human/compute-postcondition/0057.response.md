Output State: **`nodes` is a list containing at least three elements; `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`; `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`; `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ok = ok or c1 != 0` checks if `c1` is not equal to 0. If `c1` is not 0, `ok` will be set to `True`. If `c1` is already `True` or `False`, the value of `ok` will remain unchanged. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `c1`, the only thing we can definitively say is that `ok` will be `True` if `c1` is not 0, and will remain unchanged otherwise. All other variables (`nodes`, `c0`, and `c1`) retain their initial conditions.
