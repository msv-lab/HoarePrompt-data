Output State: The `nodes` list remains an empty list, `c0` remains unchanged (still 0), and `c1` is increased by the sum of `coef1[j]` for each `j` in the `nodes` list after all iterations of the loop.

In this scenario, since the `nodes` list never changes and remains empty throughout all iterations of the loop, the values of `c0` and `c1` will not change from their initial values. `c0` stays at 0 because no elements are added to it, and `c1` also stays at 0 for the same reason. The `nodes` list remains empty as no elements are appended to it within the loop.
