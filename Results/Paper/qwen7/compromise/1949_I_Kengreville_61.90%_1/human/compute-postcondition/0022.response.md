Output State: **`j` is 2, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`, `visited[j]` is True, and either `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`, or `visited[j]` remains False.**

Explanation: The code snippet `dy = y[i] - y[j]` simply reassigns the value of `dy` to `y[i] - y[j]`. Since `y[i] - y[j]` was already defined before, this assignment does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `j`, `dx`, `visited[j]`, `coef0[j]`, and `coef1[j]` remain unchanged.
