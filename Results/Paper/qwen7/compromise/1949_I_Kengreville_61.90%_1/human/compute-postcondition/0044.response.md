Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `nodes` is an empty list, `c0` is 0, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in the original `nodes` plus 1, and `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged; `coef0[1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `c0` to 0. This directly updates the value of `c0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `n` must still be greater than 0, `nodes` is still an empty list, `c1` is still the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in the original `nodes` plus 1, `ok` is still True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged, and `coef0[1]` is still 0.
