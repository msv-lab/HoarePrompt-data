Output State: **`tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2â‹…10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0**.

The code `tleftOne = 0` initializes `tleftOne` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
