Output State: The output state consists of multiple lines, where each line corresponds to the output of one test case. For each test case, if \( b \leq a \), the output is \( a \times n \). Otherwise, the output is \( b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \), with \( k = \min(n, b - a) \).

This means that for each test case, the program calculates either \( a \times n \) or \( b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \) based on the conditions given, and prints these values in separate lines.
