### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum profit Bob can make by selling \( n \) buns.
   - Bob can choose an integer \( k \) (where \( 0 \le k \le \min(n, b) \)) to sell the first \( k \) buns at a modified price, and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - The modified price for the \( i \)-th bun (for \( 1 \le i \le k \)) is \( b - i + 1 \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution iterates over the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It calculates \( k \) as the minimum of \( n \) and \( b - a \). This means \( k \) is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price if \( b > a \).
   - If \( b \le a \), it prints \( a \times n \) because all buns should be sold at the usual price.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit from selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \).

3. **Checking the Calculation:**
   - The profit from selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified price is \( b \times k - \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \).
     - \( b \times k \) is the total revenue from the first \( k \) buns.
     - \( \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \) is the sum of the first \( k-1 \) natural numbers, representing the discount due to the modified prices.
   - The profit from selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \) is \( (n - k) \times a \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When \( b \le a \), the solution correctly prints \( a \times n \).
   - When \( b > a \), the solution correctly calculates the profit using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series and the usual price.

5. **Function Summary:**
   - The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9). It then calculates either `a * n` or `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, where `k = min(n, b - a)`. Depending on whether `b <= a` or not, it prints the corresponding calculated value for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The given solution correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns under the given conditions. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, and the provided calculations match the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
