t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 \cdot 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor. The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in a.
