Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans1` includes the elements at indices 0 and 2 of `l` and appends the element at index 2 of `l`; `ans2` includes the element at index 1 of `l` and the element at index `i` of `l`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from whatever it was (initially not specified) to `k - 1`. However, since `k` was not directly involved in the initial state or the operation, and no direct assignment to `k` was made, the changes only reflect the decrement of `i` by 1, making it 1. The values of `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged as the code does not modify them directly.
