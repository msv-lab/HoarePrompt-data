Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is `req`, `i` is 0, `ans1` contains all elements that met the condition `b[i] == b[i - 1]` for some `i` in the range (1, n-1), and `l` is a list containing the first and last elements of `b` if `b[n-2]` equals `b[n-1]`, otherwise it is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `k` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is set to -2 and a list `ans2` is created containing the value of `c[i]`. Otherwise, `k` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `k` is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and the list `ans2` either remains unchanged or contains the element `c[i]` appended to it, depending on whether `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `k` is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, and the list `ans2` either remains unchanged or contains the element `c[i]` appended to it, depending on whether `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`. If `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is set to -2 and `ans2` is updated to contain the element `c[i]` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
