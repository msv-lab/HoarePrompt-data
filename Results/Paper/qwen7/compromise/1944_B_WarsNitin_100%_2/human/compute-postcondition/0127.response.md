Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
