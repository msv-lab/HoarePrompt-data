Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - If `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - `l` is a list containing `b[2]`. If `b[2]` is not equal to `b[3]`, then `l` contains `[b[2], b[3]]`; otherwise, `l` remains as `[b[2]]`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 1.

5. **Construct the New State**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - The values of `k`, `l`, and `b` do not change based on the loop head alone, so they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, and if `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `l` is a list containing `b[2]`. If `b[2]` is not equal to `b[3]`, then `l` contains `[b[2], b[3]]`; otherwise, `l` remains as `[b[2]]`**.
