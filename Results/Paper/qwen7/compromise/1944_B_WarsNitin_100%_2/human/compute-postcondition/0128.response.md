Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `b = a[:n]` creates a new list `b` that contains the first `n` elements from the list `a`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.
