Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans1` includes the element at index 0 of `l`, `ans2` includes the element at index 1 of `l`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans2`. Initially, `i` is 1. After executing the line `ans2.append(l[i])`, `i` is incremented to 2 (though the increment is not explicitly shown in the given code snippet, it is implied by the context). The value of `ans1` remains unchanged as it was initialized with the element at index 0 of `l`. Therefore, `ans2` now includes the element at index 1 of `l`.
