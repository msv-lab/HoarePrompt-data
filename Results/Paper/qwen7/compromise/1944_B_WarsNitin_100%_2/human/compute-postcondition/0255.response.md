Output State: **`i` is `n`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `q` is `t`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is a list containing the elements from index `n` to the end of `a`, `c` is sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The line `ans2 = []` initializes `ans2` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `ans1`, `q`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
