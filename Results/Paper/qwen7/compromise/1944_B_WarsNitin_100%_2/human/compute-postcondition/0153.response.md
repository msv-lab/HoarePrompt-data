Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `ans1` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Since `i` is 1, `ans1` will contain the element `b[1]`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged, and the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement remains valid.
