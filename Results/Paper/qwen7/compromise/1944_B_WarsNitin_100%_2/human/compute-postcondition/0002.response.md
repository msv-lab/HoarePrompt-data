Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers `n` and `k` using `map(int, input().split(' '))`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer between 1 and 5000, while `n` and `k` are the integers obtained from the input.
