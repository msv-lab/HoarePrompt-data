Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, and `l` contains the element `b[i]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `l`. Since `i` is `n-1`, `b[i]` is the last element of the list `b`. The values of `k` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `k` is still 0, and `i` is still `n-1`. The list `l` now includes the element `b[i]`.
