Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is set to `-n`.
- `i` is set to `2 * n - 1`.
- `ans2` contains all elements that met the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` for some `i` in the range (1, n-1) in pairs.
- `ans1` includes all elements from `l` up to the point where the loop terminated.

The code snippet `print(*ans2)` will print the elements contained in `ans2`.

To determine what `ans2` contains, we need to consider the loop's behavior and the conditions under which elements are added to `ans2`. The loop continues as long as `k` is greater than or equal to 0, and it increments `k` by -1 with each iteration. This means that after `n` iterations, `k` will be `-n`.

Given that `i` starts at `2 * n - 1` and the loop increments `i` by 1 with each iteration, after `n` iterations, `i` will be `2 * n - 1`.

The condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` must be met for elements to be added to `ans2` in pairs. Since the exact values of `c` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact elements in `ans2`. However, we know that `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive elements from `c` that satisfy the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]`.

Therefore, the output will be the elements in `ans2` printed in a space-separated format.

Output: **[pairs of elements from ans2]**
