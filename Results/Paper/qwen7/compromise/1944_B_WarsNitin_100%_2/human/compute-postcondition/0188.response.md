Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` equals 0, resulting in a break from the loop. `ans1` is a list containing all consecutive duplicate elements found in `b` from index 1 to `n-2`. `l` is a list containing the last unique element of `b` from index `n-2` to `n-1` if `b[n-2]` is not equal to `b[n-1]`; otherwise, `l` remains as an empty list.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n-1` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-2`. The loop breaks when `k` becomes 0, which happens after processing all elements up to `n-2`. During each iteration, if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i-1]`, two occurrences of `b[i]` are appended to `ans1`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i+1]`, the element `b[i]` is appended to `l`. Since the loop runs until `i` reaches `n-2`, `l` will contain the last unique element from `b[n-2]` to `b[n-1]` if they are different; otherwise, it remains empty.
