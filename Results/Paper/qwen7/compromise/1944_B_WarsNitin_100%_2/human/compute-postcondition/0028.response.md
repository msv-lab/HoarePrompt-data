Output State: **`k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or switch statement. In this case, since there was no loop or switch statement present, the `break` statement does not change the value of `k`. It simply indicates that we would break out of the most internal loop or if statement if one existed. Therefore, the only change is that we know a `break` statement has been executed.
