Postcondition: `k` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is set to -2 and `ans1` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`. Otherwise, `k` remains 0, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, and `l` contains the value of `b[i]`.
