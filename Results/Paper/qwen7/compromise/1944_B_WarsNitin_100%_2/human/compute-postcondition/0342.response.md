Output State: `k` is less than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, and `ans2` contains a list of elements where each element appears twice, provided they are consecutive in the original list `c`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The loop breaks when `k` reaches 0 or becomes negative. Since `k` starts as `req` (which is equal to `c[0]`), and each iteration reduces `k` by 2 if `c[i]` equals `c[i-1]`, `k` will eventually become 0 or less. The list `ans2` will contain pairs of consecutive equal elements from the list `c`, starting from index 1 up to `n-1`, unless `k` becomes 0 before reaching the end of the list.
