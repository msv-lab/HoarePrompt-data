Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 1 in the loop (`for i in range(1, n)`).
   - The variable `n` should be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

3. **Consider the given initial state**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `flag` is set to `True`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 1 in the loop, we don't need to change the value of `i` explicitly because it will start from 1.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Given the constraints, `n` is already within the valid range.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `n` to ensure it is at least 1 (which it already is).

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `flag` is set to True**.
