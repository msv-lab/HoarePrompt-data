Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem correctly. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and the execution summary:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Identical Elements Check**: For each test case, it checks if all elements in the array are identical by iterating through the array once. This is done using a flag `flag` which is set to `False` if any non-identical elements are found.
3. **Finding Minimum Removals**: If the array is not entirely identical, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure the array is no longer beautiful. This is done by finding the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the array.
4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case.

Given the execution summary, the program correctly identifies when the array is already beautiful (all elements identical) and prints -1. For other cases, it correctly finds the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful.

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
