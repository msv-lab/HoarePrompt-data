### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
- A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
- If it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful, the output should be \(-1\).

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes a series of test cases.
- It checks if all elements in the list are identical.
- If they are, it prints \(-1\).
- Otherwise, it finds the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the list and prints this value.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.

2. **Checking for Identical Elements:**
   - The program uses a flag to check if all elements in the array are identical.
   - This is done using a simple loop that compares adjacent elements.
   - If any pair of adjacent elements are different, the flag is set to `False`.

3. **Finding Minimum Length of Consecutive Identical Elements:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to infinity and two variables `val` and `cnt`.
   - It iterates through the array, counting consecutive identical elements.
   - When a different element is encountered, it updates `ans` with the minimum count found so far and resets `cnt`.

4. **Output:**
   - If the array is all identical (`flag` is `True`), it prints \(-1\).
   - Otherwise, it prints the minimum count of consecutive identical elements.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly identifies if the array is all identical and prints \(-1\) in such cases.
- However, the logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is flawed.
- The program only considers the minimum length of consecutive identical elements, but it does not account for the possibility of breaking the beauty condition by removing fewer elements strategically.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
- Consider the test case:
  ```
  4
  3
  2 2 2
  5
  1 2 1 2 1
  1
  1
  7
  3 3 3 5 3 3 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  -1
  1
  -1
  3
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  -1
  -1
  -1
  3
  ```

- The program incorrectly identifies the second and third test cases as having all identical elements, leading to incorrect outputs.

#### Conclusion:
- The program does not correctly handle the requirement to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
- It only checks for the presence of identical elements and does not consider the strategic removal of elements to break the beauty condition.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly implement the logic required to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
