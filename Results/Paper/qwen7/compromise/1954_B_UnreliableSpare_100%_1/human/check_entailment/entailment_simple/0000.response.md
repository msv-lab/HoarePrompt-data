Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is flawed.
2. The program checks if the array is already beautiful by comparing adjacent elements. However, this check is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that the input array is already beautiful.
3. The main issue lies in the calculation of `ans`. The program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of consecutive equal elements and prints `-1` or `0` without properly accounting for the requirement to make the array non-beautiful.
4. The program should identify the longest sequence of consecutive equal elements and calculate the number of elements to remove to break this sequence. If the entire array is made up of a single unique element, it should print `-1`.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly address the problem requirements and thus is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
