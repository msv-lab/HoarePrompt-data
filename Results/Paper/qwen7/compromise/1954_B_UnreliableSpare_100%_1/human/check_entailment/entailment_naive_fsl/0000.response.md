Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not account for the requirement to remove elements to make the array non-beautiful. Instead, it incorrectly checks if all elements are the same and prints `-1` if they are, which is not the intended behavior.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
4
3
2 2 2
5
1 2 1 2 1
1
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```

Expected Output:
```
-1
1
-1
3
```

However, the program outputs:
```
-1
-1
-1
3
```

This discrepancy occurs because the program incorrectly identifies arrays with all identical elements as non-beautiful and prints `-1`. It also fails to correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove for other cases. For example, in the second test case, the program should output `1` but instead outputs `-1`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is thus incorrect.
