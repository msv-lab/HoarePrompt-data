Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If so, it prints `-1` because no removals are needed.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of removals required to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Key Logic**:
   - The code iterates through the array to find the longest subsequence where elements are the same (`val`).
   - It counts the length of this subsequence (`cnt`).
   - The minimum number of removals required to break the beauty of the array is calculated as the minimum count of any such subsequence.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies whether the array is already uniform.
   - The calculation of the minimum number of removals is sound, as it finds the longest subsequence of identical elements and calculates the removals needed to break this subsequence.
   - The code handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

Based on the above analysis, the given program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
