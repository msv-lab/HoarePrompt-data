Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each line containing either "Yes" followed by a string or "No". For each test case (determined by the number of lines in the input), if the input string `s` has a length of 1, it outputs "No". If the input string `s` consists of the same character repeated (e.g., "aaa"), it also outputs "No". Otherwise, it outputs "Yes" followed by a possibly rearranged version of the input string `s`. If the rearranged string is the same as the original, it then outputs a cyclic shift of the string instead.
