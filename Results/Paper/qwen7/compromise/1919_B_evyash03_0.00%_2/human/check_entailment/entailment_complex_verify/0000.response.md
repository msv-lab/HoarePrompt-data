### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` into non-empty subarrays.
   - The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The program should output the minimum possible penalty.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string `s` itself.
   - The string `s` is split into parts using the `-` character as a delimiter.
   - The `func_1` function is called with the string `expression` and the length of `expression`.
   - The `func_1` function iterates through the characters of `expression`, maintaining a balance variable (`balance`) and counting the number of times the balance goes below zero.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of times the balance goes below zero while iterating through the characters of `expression`.
   - It returns this count plus 1 if the final balance is greater than 0.
   - This logic does not directly relate to calculating the penalties of the subarrays.

4. **Annotated Code Explanation**:
   - The annotated code explains that the function `func_1` counts the number of times the balance goes below zero and adds 1 if the final balance is positive.
   - This count does not represent the minimum possible penalty as required by the problem statement.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     10
     --+++++++-
     ```
   - The expected output is `4`, but the program will not produce this output because it does not correctly calculate the penalties for the optimal segmentation of the array.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` does not compute the penalties for the subarrays formed during the splitting process. Instead, it simply counts the number of times the balance goes below zero, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
