Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets to be bought (`k`) is greater than the product of the maximum tickets that can be purchased per day (`m`) and the number of days (`n`). In such cases, the program incorrectly calculates the cost.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 10 20
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
```

The program should be able to handle this case, but it fails because it assumes that `m` is always less than or equal to `k`. Specifically, the line `m = min(m, k)` is problematic because it limits `m` to the value of `k`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it can distribute the tickets across multiple days even if `k` exceeds `m * n`. This would require a more complex algorithm that distributes the tickets optimally across the days, considering the increasing prices due to the purchase of tickets on previous days.
