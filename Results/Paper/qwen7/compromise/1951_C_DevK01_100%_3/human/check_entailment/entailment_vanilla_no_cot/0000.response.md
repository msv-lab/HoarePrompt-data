To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` followed by the list of ticket prices `M`.

2. **Sorting and Initial Setup:**
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `M`.
   - It calculates the number of days `q` required to buy `k` tickets (`q = ceil(k / m)`).

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program creates a new list `N` containing the first `q` elements of `M`.
   - It calculates the cost based on the number of tickets that can be bought in full sets of `m` tickets.
   - If the remaining tickets after buying full sets cannot fill another set of `m` tickets, it adjusts the cost calculation accordingly.

### Correctness Check

1. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - Sorting the prices is necessary to ensure that the algorithm considers the cheapest days first.

2. **Calculating Full Sets of Tickets:**
   - The logic for calculating the cost when buying full sets of `m` tickets is correct. It sums up the costs for these sets and adds the additional cost due to the increase in price.

3. **Handling Remaining Tickets:**
   - The logic for handling the remaining tickets after buying full sets is also correct. It correctly calculates the additional cost due to the increased price.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the number of full sets of `m` tickets exactly matches the required `k` tickets.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic implemented in the program correctly follows the problem statement and handles all the necessary calculations. Therefore, the program should work as expected for the given problem.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
