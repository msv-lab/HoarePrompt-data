Output State: **`i` is 0; `t` must be greater than 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int; `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int.**

Explanation: The code initializes `d2` as a defaultdict with the default factory set to `int`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `t`, or `d1`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables while adding the new definition for `d2`.
