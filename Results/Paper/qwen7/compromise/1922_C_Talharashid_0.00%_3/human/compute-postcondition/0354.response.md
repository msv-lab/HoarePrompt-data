Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` must be different from 3, `s` is the sum of 1 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` plus 1, `start` is 3, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[0]` is `s + abs(lst[3] - lst[2])`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is 1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111, `d1[start]` is `s + 1`, and if `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Since `s` was initially defined as `1 + abs(lst[3] - lst[2])`, after incrementing, `s` becomes `1 + abs(lst[3] - lst[2]) + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
