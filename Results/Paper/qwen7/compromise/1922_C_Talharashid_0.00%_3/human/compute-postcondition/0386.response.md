Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is 0, `s` is either 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, `start` is decremented by 1 (if `start - 1` is greater than `-1`), `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`, and `mini` is either `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` or not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**

Explanation: The code `start += inc` increments the value of `start` by the value of `inc`, which is -1. Therefore, `start` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
