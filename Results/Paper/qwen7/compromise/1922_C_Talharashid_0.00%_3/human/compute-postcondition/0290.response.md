Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < m`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `m` must be greater than 0
   - `end` is `end - 1`
   - `s` is 0
   - `start` is `start - 1`

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`.
   - Currently, `i` is 1 and `m` must be greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, it will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making `i` equal to 2.
   - Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 2.
   - `m` remains unchanged but must still be greater than 0.

6. **Update the Other Variables**:
   - `end` is updated to `end - 1`.
   - `start` is updated to `start - 1`.
   - `s` remains 0.
   - These values do not change based on the loop condition but are part of the current state.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`**
