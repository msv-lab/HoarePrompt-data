Output State: **`start` is the input integer - 3, `end` is the input integer - 3, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is 0, `i` is 3, `m` is the input integer `m`, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`, and `s1` is the corresponding absolute difference from the other branch; end is decreased by 1.**

This means that the value of `end` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
