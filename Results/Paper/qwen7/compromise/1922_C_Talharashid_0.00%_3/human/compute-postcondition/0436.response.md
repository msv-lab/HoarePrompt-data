Output State: **`i` is 5, `m` is greater than 3, `end` is decreased by 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` to `s2`. The values of `i`, `m`, `end`, `s`, `d1`, and `d2` remain unchanged from their initial states. `s` remains 0, and `end` is decreased by 1. The exact value of `s2` depends on the values of `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`, but it is calculated as the absolute difference between these two values.
