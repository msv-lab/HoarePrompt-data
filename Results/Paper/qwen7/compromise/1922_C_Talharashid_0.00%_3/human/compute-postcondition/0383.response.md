Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is 0, `s` is `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, `start` is decremented by 1 if `start - 1` is greater than `-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`. Additionally, `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**

Explanation: The code updates `s` by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` (which is `lst[start - 1]` since `inc` is -1). The value of `s` is now `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
