Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `inc` is -1, `start` is now equal to `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is 0, `mini` holds the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is 0, `i` remains unchanged from its initial value, `m` remains unchanged from its initial state, `d1` is a dictionary where keys are indices from `start` to `end` and values are cumulative sums of distances up to those indices, `d2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `s2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `s1` remains unchanged from its initial state, `n` remains unchanged from its initial value, `lst` remains unchanged from its initial state.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d2[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `inc` is -1, `start` is now equal to `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`, `s` is either 1 or the sum of `s` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `i` remains unchanged from its initial value, `m` remains unchanged from its initial state, `d1` is a dictionary where keys are indices from `start` to `end` and values are cumulative sums of distances up to those indices, `d2[start]` is equal to `s`, `d2` remains unchanged from its initial state except for the entry at index `start`, `s2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `s1` remains unchanged from its initial state, `n` remains unchanged from its initial value, `lst` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `inc` is -1, `start` is -1, `end` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[0] - lst[-1])` and `11111111`, `s` is the sum of `s` and `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`, `i` remains unchanged from its initial value, `m` remains unchanged from its initial state, `d1[start]` is equal to `mini`, `d2[start]` is equal to the sum of `s` and `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`, `d2` remains unchanged from its initial state except for the entry at index `-1`, `s2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `s1` remains unchanged from its initial state, `n` remains unchanged from its initial value, `lst` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `inc` is -1, `start` is 0, `end` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`, `s` is the sum of `s` and either `1` or `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` plus `abs(lst[-1] - lst[-2])`, `i` remains unchanged from its initial value, `m` remains unchanged from its initial state, `d1[start]` is equal to `mini`, `d2[start]` is equal to `s`, `d2` remains unchanged from its initial state except for the entry at index `-1`, which is now `mini`, `s2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `s1` remains unchanged from its initial state, `n` remains unchanged from its initial value, `lst` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
