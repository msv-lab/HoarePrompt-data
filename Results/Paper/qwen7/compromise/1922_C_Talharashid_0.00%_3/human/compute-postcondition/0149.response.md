Output State: **`start` is the input integer - 3, `end` is the input integer - 4, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is 0, `i` is 3, `m` is the input integer `m`, `s2` is the absolute value of `d2[start] - d2[end]`, and `s1` is the absolute value of `d1[end] - d1[start]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` to `s2`. Since `start` is the input integer - 3 and `end` is the input integer - 4, `s2` is now the absolute difference between `d2[input integer - 3]` and `d2[input integer - 4]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
