Output State: **`start` is `start` - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is the final accumulated value of `s` after all iterations, `i` is 0, `m` is the input integer `m`.**

The code `end -= 1` decrements the value of `end` by 1. Since `end` was initially an input integer, now it is one less than that input integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
