Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` to `s2`. The values of `i`, `m`, `end`, `s`, and `d1` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `end` is updated to `end - 1` as per the initial state description.
