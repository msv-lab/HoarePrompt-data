Output State: **`start` is the input integer - 3, `end` is the input integer - 4, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is 0, `i` is 3, `m` is the input integer `m`, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`, and `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `s1` as the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`. Given the initial state, `end` is decreased by 1, making it `input integer - 4`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
