To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `start != end`. The loop continues as long as `start` is not equal to `end`.

Let's break down the relevant states:

- `i`: This variable is not part of the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed for this variable.
- `t`: This variable is not part of the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed for this variable.
- `d1[start]`: This variable is not part of the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed for this variable.
- `d2`: This variable is not part of the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed for this variable.
- `n`: This variable is not part of the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed for this variable.
- `lst`: This variable is not part of the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed for this variable.
- `end`: This variable is not part of the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed for this variable.
- `s`: This variable is not part of the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed for this variable.
- `start`: This variable is part of the loop condition, so we need to adjust it.
- `mini`: This variable is not part of the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed for this variable.

For the loop to continue, `start` must not be equal to `end`. Since the loop condition is `start != end`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `start`.

Given that `start` is less than `end` if `start + 1 < len(lst)` and `start - 1` is greater than -1, we can infer that `start` can increment or decrement within these bounds. However, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `start` must remain within these bounds and still not be equal to `end`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `start` to ensure it is not equal to `end`.

State: **`i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is either 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` added to the original `s`, `start` is less than `end` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, and `start - 1` is greater than -1, and `start` must not be equal to `end`**.
