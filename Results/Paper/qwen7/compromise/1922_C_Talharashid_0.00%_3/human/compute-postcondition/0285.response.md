Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`**

Explanation: The code updates `s1` to the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`. The values of `i`, `m`, `end`, `s`, `start`, and `s2` remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
