Output State: **`start` is the input integer - 3, `end` is the input integer - 4, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is 0, `i` is 3, `m` is the input integer `m`, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`, and `s1` is the absolute value of `d1[end] - d1[start]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `s1` as the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`. Given that `end` was originally `input integer - 3` and is now decreased by 1, `end` becomes `input integer - 4`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
