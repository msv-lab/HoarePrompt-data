The code `lst = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers. This affects the variable `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is `initial_value - m`, `end` is `initial_value - m - 1`, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is 0, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` is the input integer `m`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`, and `s1` is the corresponding absolute difference from the other branch, `n` is an input integer, and `lst` is a list of integers input by the user.**
