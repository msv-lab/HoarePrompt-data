Functionality: **The function accepts a list of parameters including a positive integer t, for each test case, an integer n, and a list a of n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order. Additionally, it accepts an integer m, and for each query, two distinct integers x_i and y_i within the range 1 to n. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function `func` takes a series of test cases defined by `t`, where each test case includes an integer `n`, a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers in strictly increasing order, and an integer `m` representing the number of queries. Each query consists of two distinct integers `x_i` and `y_i` within the range 1 to `n`. The function processes these inputs according to specified rules and returns the appropriate results for each test case and query.
