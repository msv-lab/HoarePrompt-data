Postcondition: **`start` is the input integer - 1, `end` is the input integer - 2, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is 0, `i` is 2, `m` is the input integer `m`, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end]), and `s1` is the corresponding absolute difference from the other branch.**
