Output State: **`start` is the input integer - 1, `end` is the input integer - 2, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is 0, `i` is 3, `m` is the input integer `m`, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end]), and `s1` is the corresponding absolute difference from the other branch; start and end are updated to be the integers obtained from input().**

Explanation: The code `start, end = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `start` and `end`. The initial values of `start` and `end` are updated to these new values, while the other variables remain unchanged.
