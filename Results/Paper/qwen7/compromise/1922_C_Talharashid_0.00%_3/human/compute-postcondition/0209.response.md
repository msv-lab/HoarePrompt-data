Output State: **`start` is increased by `inc`; `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`; if `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is `start + 1`; otherwise, `s` is updated by adding `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` to its current value.**

Explanation: The code `start += inc` increases the value of `start` by the value of `inc`. The other variables (`mini`, `lst`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, the updated state includes `start` being increased by `inc`, while the rest of the conditions and values remain as per the initial postcondition.
