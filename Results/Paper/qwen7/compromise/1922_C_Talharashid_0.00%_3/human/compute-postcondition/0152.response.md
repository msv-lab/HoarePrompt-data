Output State: **`start` is the input integer - 3, `end` is the input integer - 4, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is 0, `i` is 3, `m` is the input integer `m`, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`, and `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` to `s2`. The values of `start`, `end`, `inc`, `mini`, `s`, `i`, `m`, and `s1` remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated value of `s2` is calculated using the current values of `start` and `end`, which are `input integer - 3` and `input integer - 4`, respectively.
