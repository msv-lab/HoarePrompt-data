Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is 0, `s` is now `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `start` must be decremented further until it is not equal to 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d2[start]` is `s`, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the minimum between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` (where `inc` is -1). Since `start` must be decremented further until it is not equal to 0, the value of `s` is now `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
