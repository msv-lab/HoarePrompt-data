Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is reduced to an input integer, and the initial conditions for `n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, and `y_i` remain unchanged
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    d1 = defaultdict(int)
    d2 = defaultdict(int)
    n = int(input())
    lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
    start = 0
    end = len(lst) - 1
    inc = 1
    s = 0
    while start != end:
        mini = 11111111
        if start + 1 < len(lst):
            mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
        if start - 1 > -1:
            mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
        if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
            s += 1
        else:
            s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
        start += inc
        d1[start] = s
    start = len(lst) - 1
    end = 0
    inc = -1
    s = 0
    while start != end:
        mini = 11111111
        if start + 1 < len(lst):
            mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
        if start - 1 > -1:
            mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
        if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
            s += 1
        else:
            s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
        start += inc
        d2[start] = s
    m = int(input())
    for i in range(m):
        start, end = map(int, input().split())
        start -= 1
        end -= 1
        s = 0
        if start < end:
            s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])
            s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])
        else:
            s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start])
            s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])
        print(min(s1, s2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `start` is `initial_value - m`, `end` is `initial_value - m - 1`, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is 0, `i` is `m`, `m` is the input integer `m`, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`, and `s1` is the corresponding absolute difference from the other branch.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `start` will be set to the initial value minus the total number of iterations (`initial_value - m`). The `end` variable will be one less than `start`. Both `inc` and `mini` retain their values from the last iteration, with `inc` staying at -1 and `mini` being the smallest distance found throughout the loop. The variable `s` remains 0 as it is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration. The loop counter `i` reaches `m` after all iterations. The values of `s1` and `s2` are determined based on the conditions inside the loop but are reset to 0 at the start of each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is `end - 3`, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 3`. If `start < end` is true, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. If `start < end` is false, then `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 3, `start` is 0, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[0]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`. Similarly, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to 0 because the loop runs from `i` in the range `m`, and once `i` exceeds `m-1`, the loop terminates. The `start` and `end` values will be adjusted based on the input provided for each iteration, but since the loop decreases `end` by 1 with each iteration, by the last iteration, `end` would be 0 (assuming `m` is at least 4). However, the exact values of `start` and `end` depend on the inputs provided, which are not specified here. The `s` value remains 0 as it is initialized to 0 in each iteration and not modified within the loop body. The `s1` and `s2` values will be determined based on the conditions provided in the loop body, using the `d1` and `d2` dictionaries.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
