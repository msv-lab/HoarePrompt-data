Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d2[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `start` is `start` - 1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111, `start` + 1 is less than the length of `lst`, and if `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`. Additionally, `d2[start]` is assigned the value of `s`; if `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `s` is `start` + 1; otherwise, `s` is increased by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `start` is `start - 1`, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`, `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, and if `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`; `d2[start]` is equal to `s`, and `s` is increased by either 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` depending on whether `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` or not.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `start` is `start` - 1, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111, `d2[start]` is `s`, and if `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is the original value of `s` plus `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
