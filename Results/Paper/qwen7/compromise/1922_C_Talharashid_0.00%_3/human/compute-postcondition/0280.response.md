Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` based on whether `start < end` is true or false.**

Explanation: The code `start -= 1` decrements the value of `start` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states. Therefore, `start` is now `start - 1`.
