Postcondition: `i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is the length of `lst` - 1 and must be greater than 0, `s` is either 1 or the sum of `s` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`, `start` is 2, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[0]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is 1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. Since the else part is not provided, we assume that the condition `start - 1 > -1` is always true, leading to the if part being executed. Therefore, the value of `s` is adjusted based on the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`.
