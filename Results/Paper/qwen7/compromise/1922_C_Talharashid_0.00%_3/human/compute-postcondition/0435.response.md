Output State: **`i` is 5, `m` is greater than 3, `end` is decreased by 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`**.

In this case, the code initializes `s1` with the absolute difference between the values of `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`. However, since the actual values of `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` are not provided, `s1` is expressed as the absolute difference between these two indices. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
