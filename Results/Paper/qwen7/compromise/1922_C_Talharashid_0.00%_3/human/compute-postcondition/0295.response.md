Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`**.

The code calculates the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` and assigns it to `s1`. Since the exact values of `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` are not provided, `s1` is expressed as the absolute difference between these two elements. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
