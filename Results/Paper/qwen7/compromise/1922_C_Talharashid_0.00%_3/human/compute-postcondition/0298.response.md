Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`, `start` is `start - 1`**

Explanation: The code assigns `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` to `s2`. Since `start` and `end` are updated to `start - 1` and `end - 1` respectively in the initial state, `s2` is calculated using these updated values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
