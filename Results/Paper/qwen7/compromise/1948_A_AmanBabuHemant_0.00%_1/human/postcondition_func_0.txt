The function processes up to 50 test cases, each involving an integer `n`. For each test case, if `n` is odd, it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is even and less than 400, it outputs 'YES' followed by a string consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times, truncated to 200 characters if necessary. If `n` is even and 400 or greater, it outputs 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.
