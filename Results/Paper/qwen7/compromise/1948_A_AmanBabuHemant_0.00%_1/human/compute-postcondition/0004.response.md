Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, and `n` is between 1 and 50 inclusive. Depending on the values of `t` and `n`, the function returns either an error message if `t` is out of range, another error message if `n` is out of range, or no specific return value as the parameters are not directly passed to the function.**

However, since the function definition does not include parameters `t` and `n` in its signature, and the problem statement mentions these parameters without including them in the function definition, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. Based on the given function signature, the function does not accept any parameters.

If the intention was to describe the behavior of the function given the constraints on `t` and `n`, the correct format would be:
