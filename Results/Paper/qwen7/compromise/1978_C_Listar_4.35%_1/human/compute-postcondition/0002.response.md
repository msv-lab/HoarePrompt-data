Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is explicitly given as 0.
- `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\). However, the value of `k` itself is not specified in the initial state.
- Both `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, but the specific values of `n` and `k` are already known from the initial state.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
