To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze each function and how they work together to solve the problem. Let's break down the functions and their logic:

### Function Analysis

1. **`func_1(n, k)`**:
   - This function attempts to construct a permutation based on `n` and `k`.
   - It starts by initializing a list `l` with numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then iteratively modifies this list to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - The logic seems flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the construction of permutations to achieve the exact Manhattan value `k`.

2. **`func_2()`**:
   - This function checks if a given `k` is achievable for a permutation of length `n`.
   - It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value for the given `n`.
   - The logic here is partially correct but incomplete. It should also check if `k` is even and within bounds.

3. **`func_3(l)`**:
   - This function prints the permutation `l` if it exists.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of `l` separated by spaces.
   - It then prints a newline.

4. **`func_4()`**:
   - This function orchestrates the solution by calling `func_2` and `func_1`.
   - If `func_2` returns `(0, 0)`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` and `func_3` to generate and print the permutation.

### Correctness Check

1. **`func_1(n, k)`**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It doesn't correctly compute the permutation to achieve the exact Manhattan value `k`. For instance, it doesn't handle the insertion and removal of elements correctly to achieve the desired value.

2. **`func_2()`**:
   - The function correctly identifies when `k` is odd or when `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value for the given `n`.
   - However, it doesn't fully validate whether `k` is achievable for both even and odd `n`.

3. **`func_3(l)`**:
   - This function works correctly as long as `l` is a valid permutation.

4. **`func_4()`**:
   - The function correctly handles the flow of checking and generating the permutation.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the primary issue lies in `func_1(n, k)`, which does not correctly construct the permutation to achieve the exact Manhattan value `k`. Therefore, the overall program cannot be considered correct due to the flaw in `func_1`.

**Correctness: False**
