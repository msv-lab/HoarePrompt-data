### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function checks if `k` is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`.
- It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd, indicating that no valid permutation exists.
- If `n` is odd, `max_k` is calculated as \((n^2 - 1) // 2\).
- If `n` is even, `max_k` is calculated as \(n^2 // 2\).
- It returns `n` and `k` if `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function constructs a permutation based on the value of `k` and the length `n`.
- It iterates from `n-1` down to `0` and adjusts the list `l` accordingly.
- The logic inside the loop ensures that the last element of the list is moved to the front when necessary to achieve the desired `k` value.
- If `k` becomes zero, it returns the list `l`.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation.
- It does not handle the case where no valid permutation exists.

#### Function `func_4`:
- This function integrates the above functions to solve the problem.
- It calls `func_2` to get `n` and `k`.
- If `n` is zero, it prints "NO" and returns.
- Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to get the permutation and then calls `func_3` to print the result.

### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Handling Odd `k` Values**: The problem statement specifies that the Manhattan value is always even. Therefore, if `k` is odd, the program should return "NO".
2. **Constructing Permutations**: The function `func_1` should correctly construct permutations for even `k` values.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases such as small values of `n` and `k`.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Correctly checks if `k` is even.
   - Calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a given `n`.
   - Returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd, which is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is designed to construct a permutation that achieves the desired `k` value.
   - It iterates from `n-1` down to `0` and adjusts the list `l` to ensure the Manhattan value is achieved.
   - The logic seems to be correct for constructing permutations for even `k` values.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - Simply prints "YES" and the constructed permutation.
   - Does not handle the case where no valid permutation exists, but this is handled by `func_4`.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - Integrates the above functions to solve the problem.
   - Handles the case where `n` is zero by printing "NO".
   - Calls `func_1` to construct the permutation and `func_3` to print it.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly handles the problem description. It checks if `k` is odd and returns "NO" in that case. For even `k` values, it constructs a permutation using `func_1` and prints it using `func_3`. The logic in `func_1` is designed to achieve the desired Manhattan value, and the overall structure of the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided annotations.
