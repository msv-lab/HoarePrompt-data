Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `t` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is less than `int(input())`.

3. **Initial States**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`.
   - `b` is a list of 26 zeros.

4. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be less than the value obtained from `int(input())`.
   - The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` do not affect the loop condition directly and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only variables that need adjustment are `t` and the input value from `int(input())`.

Since `t` is already within the specified range, the key is to ensure that the input value from `int(input())` is greater than `t` for the loop to execute.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- The input value from `int(input())` must be greater than `t`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), int(input()) must be greater than `t`**
