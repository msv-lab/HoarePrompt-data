Output State: **`b` is a list, `i` is an element in `b`, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`.**

Explanation: The code `x = b.index(i)` assigns the index of `i` in the list `b` to the variable `x`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `b` and `i`, we can only state that `i` is an element in `b` and `x` is the index of `i` in `b`. The other variables remain in their initial state.
