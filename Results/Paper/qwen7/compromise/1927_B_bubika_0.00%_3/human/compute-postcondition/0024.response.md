Output State: **`b` is a list where each element's count has been incremented by the number of times it appears in `s` (after processing the current input), `r` is an empty string, `s` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, and the next input is ready to be processed.**

Explanation: The line `r = ''` initializes the variable `r` as an empty string. The values of `b` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the next input is still ready to be processed.
