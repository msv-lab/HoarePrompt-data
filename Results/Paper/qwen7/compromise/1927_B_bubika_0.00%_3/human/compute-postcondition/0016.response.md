Output State: **`b[x]` is increased by 1, `r` is increased by `2 * a[x]`, `i` is the next element in `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in list `b`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `r += a[x]` increases the value of `r` by `a[x]`. Since `a[x]` is equal to `a[x]`, the new value of `r` is the original value of `r` plus `a[x]`, which can be expressed as `r` being increased by `2 * a[x]` (assuming `a[x]` was previously `a[x]`). The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
