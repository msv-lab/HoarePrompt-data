Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is a variable that will iterate over the elements of the list `s`.
   - `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `s` to iterate over.
   - Once `i` has iterated through all elements of `s`, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over each element in the list `s`, `s` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `i` will start from the first element of the list `s` and increment with each iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer greater than `t`.
- `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
- `r` is an empty string.

We need to ensure that the list `s` has at least one element for the loop to execute. The values of `t`, `n`, and `r` do not affect the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `s` must have at least one element.

**Final State:**
State: **`s` is a list of integers that must have at least one element**
