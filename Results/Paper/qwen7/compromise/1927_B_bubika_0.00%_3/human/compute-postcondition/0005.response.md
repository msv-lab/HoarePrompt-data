Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than `t`; `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers; `r` is an empty string.**

The code initializes the variable `r` as an empty string. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.
