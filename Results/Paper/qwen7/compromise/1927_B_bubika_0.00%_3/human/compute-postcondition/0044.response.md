Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the elements of the list `s`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over the elements of the list `s`, the initial value of `i` will be the first element of the list `s` when the loop starts.

3. **Determine the State of `s`**: The list `s` is already defined as a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one element.

4. **Determine the State of `r`**: The variable `r` is initially an empty string and is not involved in the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the list `s` contains at least one element for the loop to execute. The initial value of `i` will be the first element of the list `s`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is an input integer that must be less than N, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `r` is an empty string, and `i` is the first element of the list `s`**.
