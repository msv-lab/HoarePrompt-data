Output State: **`s` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of the list `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `s`, `r` is increased by `a[x]`, `b[x]` is increased by 1, `r` is the updated value of `r + a[x]`, `b[x]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b[x] += 1` increases the value of `b[x]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated state includes that `b[x]` has been incremented by 1.
