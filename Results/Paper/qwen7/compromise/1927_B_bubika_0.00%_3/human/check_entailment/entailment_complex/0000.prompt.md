Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n.
def func():
    a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    b = [0] * 26
    for t in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        r = ''
        
        for i in s:
            x = b.index(i)
            r += a[x]
            b[x] += 1
        
        print(r)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `b` will be a list where each element's count reflects the total number of times that corresponding integer (from 0 to 25) appeared across all inputs `s` provided by the loop. The variable `r` will be a string constructed by repeating characters from `a` based on the cumulative counts of the integers in `s`. Each character in `a` will be repeated according to how many times its corresponding integer in `b` was incremented throughout the entire loop execution.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `b` will show the total frequency of each integer from `s` across all iterations, and `r` will be a string where each character from `a` is repeated according to the total count of its corresponding integer in `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer `t` indicating the number of subsequent test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and a list `s` of `n` non-negative integers. It then constructs a string `r` by mapping each integer in `s` to a character in the alphabet `a` (where `a` contains the first 26 lowercase letters of the English alphabet) and repeats each character according to the frequency of its corresponding integer in `s`. The function updates a count array `b` to keep track of the total occurrences of each integer across all test cases. Finally, it prints the constructed string `r` for each test case.
