Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` remains the same as the initial value, `s` remains the same as the initial value, `l` is sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `l.sort()` sorts the list `l` in ascending order. The values of `i`, `c`, `n`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states. After sorting, the list `l` is updated to its sorted version.
