Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` must have been greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once. The variable `c` will hold the cumulative sum of the expression `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration, where `s` is determined by `min(m, k)` and then decremented by `s` in each iteration.
