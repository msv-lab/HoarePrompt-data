Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `s` is 0, `c` is `k * k / 2`, `n` is an input integer, `m` remains the same as the initial value, `l` is sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code assigns `k * k / 2` to `c`. The values of `i`, `s`, `n`, `m`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
