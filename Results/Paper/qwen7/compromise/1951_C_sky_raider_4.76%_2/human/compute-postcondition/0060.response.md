Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is `k - n * s`, `c` is the sum of `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from 0 to `n-1`, `s` is `min(m, k)`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating the loop has finished executing. The variable `k` will be reduced by `n * s` where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` at the start of each iteration. The variable `c` will hold the cumulative sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from 0 to `n-1`, and `s` will be updated to the minimum of `m` and `k` after the last iteration.
