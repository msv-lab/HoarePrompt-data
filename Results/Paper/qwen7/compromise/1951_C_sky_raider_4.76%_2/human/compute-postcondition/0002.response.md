Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `l` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `l`. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
