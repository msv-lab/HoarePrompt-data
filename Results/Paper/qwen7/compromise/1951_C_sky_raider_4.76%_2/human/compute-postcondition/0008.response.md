Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - s`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by `s`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid. The value of `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, but since `s` itself is not directly modified by the given code, its value remains as the minimum of `m` and `k`.
