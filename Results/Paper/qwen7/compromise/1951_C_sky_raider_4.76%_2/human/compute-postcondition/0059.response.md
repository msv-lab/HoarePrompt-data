Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is `k - 2 * s - s`, `c` is `c + 2 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`, `s` is `min(m, k)`**

Explanation: 
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but its exact value is not specified, so it remains as `i + 1`.
- The variable `n` is an input integer, which remains unchanged.
- The variable `m` is an input integer, which remains unchanged.
- The variable `k` is updated to `k - 2 * s - s`, which simplifies to `k - 3 * s`.
- The variable `c` is updated to `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, which simplifies to `c + 2 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`.
- The variable `s` is updated to `min(m, k)`, which means `s` takes the minimum value between `m` and `k`.

All other variables remain in their initial or unchanged states.
