Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `k` is updated to `k - 2 * s`, where `s` is the smaller value between `m` and `k`.
   - `c` is updated to `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be less than `n`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `k` will be updated to `k - 2 * s` (as it is not affected by the loop increment).
   - `c` will be updated based on the new value of `i` and the current values of `l[i]`, `s`, and `k`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `m` remains the same.
- `k` is updated to `k - 2 * s`.
- `c` is updated to `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is `k - 2 * s`, `c` is `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`**
