Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the smaller value between `m` and `k`, `c` is `k * k / 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the smaller between `m` and `k` to `s`. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
