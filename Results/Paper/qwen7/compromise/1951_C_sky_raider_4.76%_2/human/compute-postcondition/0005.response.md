Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input split by spaces, `s` is 0, `c` is `k * k / 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `k * k / 2` to the variable `c`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
