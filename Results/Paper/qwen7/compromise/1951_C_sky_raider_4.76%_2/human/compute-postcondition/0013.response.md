Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `c` is `c + l[1] * s - s * s / 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `c` by adding the value of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value. Here, `i` is 1, so `l[i]` is `l[1]`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
