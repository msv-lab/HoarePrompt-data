Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers [n, m, x1 + a, y1=1, x2 - a, y2 - a], `b` is the difference between `x2 - a` and `x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, `c` is `y2 - 1`.**

The code assigns `y2 - 1` to the variable `c`. Since `y2` is one of the elements in the list `r` and its exact value is not specified, `c` is simply expressed as `y2 - 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
