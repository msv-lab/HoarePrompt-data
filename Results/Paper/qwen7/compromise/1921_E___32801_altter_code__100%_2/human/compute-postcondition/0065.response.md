Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers [n, m, x1, y1, x2, y2], where n, m, x1, y1, x2, and y2 are the integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and (x2 - x1) % 2 == 0, and y1 is not equal to y2, and y2 is less than y1; `a` is `m - y1`**.

This means that the variable `a` has been assigned the value `m - y1`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
