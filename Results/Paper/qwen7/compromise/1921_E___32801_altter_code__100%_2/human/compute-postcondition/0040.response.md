Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers [n, m, x1 + a, y, x2 - a, 1], `b` is the value of (x2 - a) - x1, `y1` is decreased by `a`, where the difference ((x2 - a) - x1) is even, and y is 0; `t` is equal to the absolute value of 1 - y1, and the condition (x2 > x1 and x1 ≥ 1 and x2 ≤ n) holds.**

Explanation: The code `y1 -= a` decreases the value of `y1` by `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions and relationships between the variables that were true before the operation still hold.
