Output State: **The program returns a list [n, m, x1 + 1, y, x2, y2] where n and m are integers, x1 + 1 and x2 are integers with x2 being greater than x1 and the difference (x2 - x1) being odd, and y is equal to y1 which is also equal to y2.**

This output state describes the list that the program returns, based on the given initial conditions.
