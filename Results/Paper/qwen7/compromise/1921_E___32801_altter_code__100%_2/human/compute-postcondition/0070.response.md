Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers [n, m, x1 + a, y1, x2 - a, y2], `b` is the difference between `x2 - a` and `x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.**

Explanation: The value of `x2` is decreased by `a`, so `x2` becomes `x2 - a`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `b` is updated to be the difference between `x2 - a` and `x1`, and `t` remains the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
