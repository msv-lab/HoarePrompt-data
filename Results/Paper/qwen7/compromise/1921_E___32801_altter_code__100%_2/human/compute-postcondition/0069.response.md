Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers [n, m, x1 + a, y1, x2, y2], `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.**

Explanation: The code `x1 += a` increments the value of `x1` by `a`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0` and `y1` is not equal to `y2` remains valid. The value of `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, and `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`.
