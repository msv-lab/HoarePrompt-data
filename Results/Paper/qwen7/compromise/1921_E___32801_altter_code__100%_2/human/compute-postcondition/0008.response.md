Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `r` is a list containing six integers `[n, m, x1, y1, x2, y2]`.
- `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are integers obtained from the input and converted to integers.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- The difference `(x2 - x1)` is odd.
- The current value of `y1` is equal to `y2`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Alice'` to the console. Since no variables from the list `r` or any other variables are involved in this print statement, the output is directly the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
