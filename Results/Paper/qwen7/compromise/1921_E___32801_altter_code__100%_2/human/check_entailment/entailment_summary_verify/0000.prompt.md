You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes input coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) to determine if player Alice or Bob wins based on certain conditions. The function reads six integers from input representing the number of test cases, grid dimensions (n, m), and coordinates of two points. It then checks several conditions involving the coordinates and prints either "Alice", "Bob", or "draw" based on these conditions. If the conditions are met, it may adjust the coordinates and return a modified list of coordinates or the absolute difference between y-coordinates. Otherwise, it returns None.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and logic. Specifically, the program does not handle all possible moves and outcomes correctly. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Conditions and Movement Rules**: The program checks if `x2 <= x1` and prints "draw" if true. However, this condition alone is not sufficient to determine the game state. The program should consider the relative positions and possible moves of both players more comprehensively.

2. **Movement Logic**: The program attempts to adjust the positions of Alice and Bob based on certain conditions but does not fully account for all possible scenarios. For instance, the logic to update `y1` and `x1` and `y2` and `x2` is incomplete and may lead to incorrect outcomes.

3. **Winning Conditions**: The program does not correctly handle the winning conditions where a player places their chip on the other player's chip. The logic to check for these conditions is insufficient and may miss some cases.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not adequately handle edge cases such as when Alice or Bob reaches the boundary of the board or when they are very close to each other but not exactly on the same position.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the game logic for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
