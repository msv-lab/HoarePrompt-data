Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables**:
   - `t` is an input integer.
   - `i` is the loop variable that starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute even once.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `i` is 0, as the loop starts with `i = 0`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` should be 0 (as it is the starting point of the loop).

**Final State**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
