Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(m)` will execute if `m` is at least 1. This means `m` must be greater than 0.
   - The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 with each iteration. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be 0.

3. **List the necessary adjustments**:
   - We need to ensure that `m` is greater than 0.
   - We need to set `i` to 0.

4. **Consider other variables**:
   - The variables `start`, `end`, `inc`, `s`, `mini`, `d2[start]`, and `lst` are not part of the loop head and their values do not directly affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `m` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
