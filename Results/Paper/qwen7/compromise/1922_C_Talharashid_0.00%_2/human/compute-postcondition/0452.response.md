Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `start` is an integer entered by the user minus 5, `end` is an integer entered by the user minus 3, `s` is 0, `s1` and `s2` are calculated based on the values of `start` and `end`, `end` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `end -= 1` decreases the value of `end` by 1. The initial state of `end` was `integer entered by the user minus 2`. After the operation, `end` becomes `integer entered by the user minus 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
