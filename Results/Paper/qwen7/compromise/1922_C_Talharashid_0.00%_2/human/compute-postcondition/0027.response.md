Output State: **`start' is start plus inc, `i` is either 1 or 2, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default factory int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `end` must be 0, `s` is either 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`, and `start - 1 > -1` and `mini` is not updated to the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and `mini` if `i` is 1, otherwise `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**

This means that the variable `start` has been incremented by the value of `inc`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
