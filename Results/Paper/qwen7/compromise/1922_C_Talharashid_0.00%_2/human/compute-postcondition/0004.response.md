Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The initial values of `t`, `i`, `d1`, and `d2` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `d1` and `d2` are still defaultdicts with the default factory set to int, and `n` now holds the integer value of the user's input.
