Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `lst` by mapping each element of the input (split by spaces) to an integer. The original values of `t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, and `n` remain unchanged. The new variable `lst` is created and populated with the integer values from the input.
