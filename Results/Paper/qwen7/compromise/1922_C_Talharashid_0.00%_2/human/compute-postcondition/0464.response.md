Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `m-1`. The variables `start` and `end` will be adjusted based on the number of iterations `m`. Specifically, `start` will be the initial value of `start` minus `2 * m`, and `end` will be the last `end` value entered by the user minus 1. The variable `s` will be 0 because it is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration. The variable `s2` will hold the minimum absolute difference calculated from the values in `d1` and `d2` arrays, depending on whether `start` is less than `end`.

In summary, the final state of the variables after the loop completes all iterations will be:
- `i`: `m-1`
- `start`: Initial `start` value minus `2 * m`
- `end`: Last `end` value minus 1
- `s`: 0
- `s2`: Minimum absolute difference from `d1` and `d2` arrays based on the condition `start < end`
