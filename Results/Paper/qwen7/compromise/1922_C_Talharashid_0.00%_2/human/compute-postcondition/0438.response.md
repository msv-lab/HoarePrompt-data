Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `start` is `start - 2`.
   - `end` is an integer entered by the user minus 1.
   - `s` is 0.
   - `s2` is either the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, or the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` if `start >= end`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `m`, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `m` remains the same (it must still be greater than 0).
   - `i` becomes 1.
   - `start` remains `start - 2`.
   - `end` remains an integer entered by the user minus 1.
   - `s` remains 0.
   - `s2` remains either the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, or the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` if `start >= end`.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `start` is `start - 2`, `end` is an integer entered by the user minus 1, `s` is 0, and `s2` is either the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, or the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` if `start >= end`.**
