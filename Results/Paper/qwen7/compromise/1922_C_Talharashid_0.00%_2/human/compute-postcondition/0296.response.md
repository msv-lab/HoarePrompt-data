Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `start` is `start` - 2, `end` is an integer entered by the user - 3, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` to `s1`. Since `start` and `end` are not directly modified by this line of code, their values remain as they were in the initial state. The other variables (`m`, `i`, `s`, `s2`) are also not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
