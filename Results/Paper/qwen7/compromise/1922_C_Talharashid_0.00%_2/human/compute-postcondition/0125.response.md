Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` to `s2`. The values of `i`, `m`, `start`, `end`, `s`, and `s1` remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
