Output State: **`start` is increased by `inc`, `end` is 0, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, and 11111111, `d2[start]` is assigned the value of `s`.**

Explanation: The code `start += inc` increments the value of `start` by the value of `inc`. The other variables (`end`, `mini`, `d2[start]`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
