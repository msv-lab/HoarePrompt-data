Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start` - 1, `end` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` if `start < end` is true, or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` if `start < end` is false.**

Explanation: The variable `start` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `start` is now one less than its original value, while `m`, `end`, `s`, and `s2` retain their initial conditions.
