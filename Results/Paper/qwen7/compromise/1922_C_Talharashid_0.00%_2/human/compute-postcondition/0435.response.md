Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `start` is `start - 2`, `end` is an integer entered by the user minus 1, `s` is 0, and `s2` is either the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end` is true, or the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` if `start < end` is false.
