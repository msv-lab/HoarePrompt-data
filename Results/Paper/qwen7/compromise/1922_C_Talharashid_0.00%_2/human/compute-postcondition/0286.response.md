Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `start` is the integer entered by the user - 2, `end` is the integer entered by the user - 2, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, `s2` is either the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` if `start >= end`, or the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` and assigns it to `s1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `s2` remains dependent on the condition `start >= end`, but since `s1` has been updated, it is now explicitly mentioned in the output state.
