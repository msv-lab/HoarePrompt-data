Output State: **`end` is 0, `start` is decreased to a value less than `len(lst)` but not equal to 0, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and 11111111, `s` is the cumulative sum based on the conditions inside the loop, `d2[start]` is assigned the final value of `s`, and `d1[start]` remains equal to `s`. An integer input is taken and stored in `m`.**

The input integer `m` is assigned to the variable `n`, but no other changes are made to the variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `end`, `start`, `mini`, `s`, `d2[start]`, and `d1[start]` remain unchanged except that `start` is now decreased to a value less than `len(lst)` but not equal to 0, and `m` is the new value of `n`.
