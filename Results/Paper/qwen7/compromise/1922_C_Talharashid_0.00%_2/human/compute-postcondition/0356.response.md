Postcondition: `start` is 8, `end` must be different from 8, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[7] - lst[8])` and `11111111`, `s` is the original value of `s` plus `abs(lst[4] - lst[4 + inc])`, `d1[start]` is `s`.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of the condition in the if statement, `start` remains 8, `end` must be different from 8, `mini` is adjusted based on the new comparison with `lst[7]` and `11111111`, `s` is incremented by the absolute difference between `lst[4]` and `lst[4 + inc]`, and `d1[start]` is updated to the current value of `s`.
