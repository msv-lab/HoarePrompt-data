Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `start != end`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `start` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1.
   - `end` is 0.
   - `inc` is -1.
   - `s` is calculated based on the list `lst` and the current values of `start` and `end`.
   - `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111.
   - `d2[start]` is assigned the value of `s`.
   - `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`.

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - For the loop to continue, `start` must not be equal to `end`.
   - Currently, `start` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, and `end` is 0.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `start` must be greater than `end`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `end` is 0, `start` must be greater than 0 and has been decremented from its previous value.
   - To ensure `start` is still greater than `end` (which is 0), `start` must be decremented further.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `start`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`start` must be greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is calculated based on the list `lst` and the current values of `start` and `end`, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111, `d2[start]` is assigned the value of `s`, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`, and `start` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop continues.**
