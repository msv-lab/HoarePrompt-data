Output State: **`start` is increased by `inc`; `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`; if `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is `start + 1`; otherwise, `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.**

Explanation: The code `start += inc` increases the value of `start` by the value of `inc`. The other variables (`mini`, `s`, and `lst`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The postconditions specified for `mini`, `s`, and the condition involving `lst` are still valid and unchanged by this operation.
