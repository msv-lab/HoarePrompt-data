Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is an integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The value of `start` is decremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `m` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0 still holds true. The value of `end` remains as the integer entered by the user.
