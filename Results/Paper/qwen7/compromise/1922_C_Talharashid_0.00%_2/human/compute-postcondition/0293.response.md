Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `start` is `start` - 1, `end` is an integer entered by the user - 2, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` if `start < end`, or the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` if `start >= end`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, or the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` if `start >= end`.**

Explanation: The value of `start` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions and relationships among the variables are preserved except for the updated value of `start`.
