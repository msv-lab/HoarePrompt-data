Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `m` must be greater than 0
   - `start` is `start` - 1
   - `end` is `end` - 1
   - `s` is 0
   - `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` if `start < end` is true, or `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` if `start < end` is false.
   - If `start < end` is true, then `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`, and if `start < end` is false, then `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` and `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `m`, and `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `m` must still be greater than 1.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `m`.

**State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 1, `start` is `start` - 1, `end` is `end` - 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` if `start < end` is true, or `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` if `start < end` is false. If `start < end` is true, then `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`, and if `start < end` is false, then `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` and `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`**.
