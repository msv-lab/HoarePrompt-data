Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `start` is an integer entered by the user minus 3, `end` is now an integer entered by the user minus 2, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, `s2` is either the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, or the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` if `start >= end`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` to `s1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for `s2` remains the same, depending on whether `start` is less than `end`.
