Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string; `j` is 'A'; `l` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which is not relevant since it is not given). Since `j` and `a` are not affected by the code, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, `l` is now 1.
