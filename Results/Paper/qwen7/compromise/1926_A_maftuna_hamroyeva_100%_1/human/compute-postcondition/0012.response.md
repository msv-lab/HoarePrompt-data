Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `a`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `a` is a non-empty string, and `j` is either 'A' or not 'A'. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 1. If `j` is not 'A', then `h` is 1.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must still be a non-empty string.
   - `j` must be the next character in the string `a`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `a` is a non-empty string, it will remain a non-empty string unless all characters are exhausted.
   - `j` will be the next character in the string `a`.

5. **Update the postcondition**:
   - `a` remains a non-empty string.
   - `j` becomes the next character in `a`.
   - If the new `j` is 'A', then `l` will be 1. If the new `j` is not 'A', then `h` will be 1.

Given these points, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the next character in the string `a`, if `j` is 'A', then `l` is 1, if `j` is not 'A', then `h` is 1**.
