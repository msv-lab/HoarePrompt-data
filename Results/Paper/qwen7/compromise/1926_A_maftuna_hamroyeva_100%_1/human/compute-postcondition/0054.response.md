Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an empty string.
- `j` is undefined because `a` is empty.
- `l` is greater than `h`, where `h` is the total number of 'A' characters in the original string `a` (which is 0 since `a` is empty).
- `h` is equal to the total number of characters in `a` minus `l`, so `h` is 0.
- `i` is `i + n`, where `n` is the length of the original string `a` (which is 0).

Given these conditions, the `print('A')` statement will simply print the string 'A'.

Output: **A**
