Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(t)`.
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop will continue if `i < t`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the condition was satisfied, meaning `i` was less than `t`.

3. **Update the state of the variables:**
   - Since the loop continues, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.

4. **Check the postcondition:**
   - The postcondition does not change based on the values of `a`, `j`, `l`, or `h` within the loop. It only depends on the value of `t` and whether the loop continues.

5. **Adjust the state:**
   - The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which will be incremented by 1.
   - The other variables (`a`, `j`, `l`, `h`, and `t`) remain unchanged according to the given postcondition.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the last character in the string `a`, the variable `l` represents the total count of 'A' characters in `a`, the variable `h` represents the total count of non-'A' characters in `a`, and `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` was the last value before the loop started). The value of `t` remains the same.**
