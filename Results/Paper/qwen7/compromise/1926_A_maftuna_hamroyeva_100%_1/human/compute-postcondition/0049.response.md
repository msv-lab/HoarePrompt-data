Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty string with its length reduced by 1, `j` is the last character of `a`, `l` is 3 if `j` is 'A', and either 2 or 1 otherwise, `h` is 2 if `j` is not 'A' and either 3 or 1 if `j` is 'A', and `i` is `i + 1`.

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block. If `j` is 'A', `l` becomes 3 and `h` becomes 1; otherwise, `l` remains 2 and `h` changes to 2 if `j` is not 'A', or to 1 if `j` is 'A'. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1 in both cases.
