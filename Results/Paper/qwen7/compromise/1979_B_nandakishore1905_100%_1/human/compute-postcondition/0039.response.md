Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them into integers, assigning them to `n` and `m` respectively. The initial state's increment of `i` by 1 and the loop condition checking if `i` is less than the integer input remain unchanged in terms of their description. However, now we know the specific values of `n` and `m` are the integers input by the user.
