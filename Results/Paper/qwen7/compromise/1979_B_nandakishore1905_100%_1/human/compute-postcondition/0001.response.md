Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is equal to `t`; `m` is the second integer input split from the same input line.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers using `map(int, input().split())`. Since `int(input())` was equal to `t`, the first integer in the split input is assigned to `n`, making `n` equal to `t`. The second integer is assigned to `m`. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) remains valid.
