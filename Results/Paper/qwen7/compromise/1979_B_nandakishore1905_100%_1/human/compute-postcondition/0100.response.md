Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases (t) where each test case consists of two distinct non-negative integers (x and y). For each test case, it returns either "x < y", "x > y", or "x == y" based on the comparison of x and y.**

Given the constraints, the function seems to process a series of test cases defined by the variable `t`. For each test case, it compares two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y` and returns a string indicating the result of the comparison: "x < y" if `x` is less than `y`, "x > y" if `x` is greater than `y`, and "x == y" if `x` is equal to `y`.
