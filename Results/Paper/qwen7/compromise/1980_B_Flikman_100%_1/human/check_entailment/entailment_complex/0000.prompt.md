Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each test case consists of three integers n, f, and k such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, followed by a list of n integers a_i where 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        
        sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
        
        removed_count = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
                removed_count += 1
        
        favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)
        
        if removed_count == favorite_count:
            print('YES')
        elif removed_count == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')
        
    #State: Output State: All variables outside the loop, including `t`, `_`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, `favorite_value`, `sorted_a`, and `favorite_count`, remain unchanged. The variable `removed_count` retains its final value after all iterations of the loop have completed, which could be any non-negative integer depending on the input data. If `removed_count` equals `favorite_count` for all iterations, the condition `if removed_count == favorite_count:` will be true, and "YES" will be printed for each iteration. If `removed_count` never equals `favorite_count`, the condition `elif removed_count == 0:` will be true, and "NO" will be printed for each iteration. Otherwise, "MAYBE" will be printed for each iteration where `removed_count` does not equal `favorite_count` and `removed_count` is not zero.
    #
    #In summary, the output state after all iterations will reflect the final values of `removed_count` and `favorite_count` based on the input data, with all other variables retaining their initial or intermediate values from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( f \), and \( k \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_i \). For each test case, it checks if the count of the \( f \)-th element in the sorted list of \( a_i \) (in descending order) matches the count of that element in the original list. If the counts match for all iterations, it prints "YES". If the count of the \( f \)-th element is never found in the list, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "MAYBE". The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
