Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes each test case by first determining the value of the favorite cube, then sorts the cubes in non-increasing order of their values, counts how many of the first `k` cubes match the favorite cube's value, and compares this count with the total number of times the favorite cube's value appears in the sorted list. Based on these comparisons, it prints "YES", "NO", or "MAYBE" as required. The logic handles all edge cases and examples provided, ensuring the program is correct.
