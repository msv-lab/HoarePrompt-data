Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < k`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `k` is greater than 0.
   - If the value at index `i` in `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `k`, and `removed_count` remain unchanged.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0 and the loop condition is `i < k`, the loop will execute again because `0 < k` (which is true since `k` is greater than 0).
   - After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `removed_count` remains unchanged unless the condition `sorted_a[i] == favorite_value` is met, but we cannot assume this based on the given information.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `k` remains unchanged and still needs to be greater than 0.
   - `removed_count` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, and `removed_count` remains unchanged**.
