Postcondition: **`removed_count` is `k`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 1, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in the list `a`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers which is a sorted version of `a` in descending order, `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`. The condition `removed_count == favorite_count` is true.**
