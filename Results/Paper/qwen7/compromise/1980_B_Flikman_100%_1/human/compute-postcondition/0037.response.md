Output State: **`a` is a list containing three integers where the first integer is `n`, the second integer is `f`, and the third integer is `k`, `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list `a`. Since the input consists of exactly three integers (the values of `n`, `f`, and `k`), `a` will be a list containing these three integers in the order they were originally. The values of `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
