Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 1, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `n, f, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and splits them into `n`, `f`, and `k`. The initial state of `t` and `_` remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, and `_` is still 1. The values of `n`, `f`, and `k` are the integers obtained from the input.
