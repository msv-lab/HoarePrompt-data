Postcondition: **`removed_count` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 1, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in the list `a`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers which is a sorted version of `a` in descending order, `k` must be a positive integer and at least 1, and the current value of `i` is such that the element at index `i` in `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`**.

This means that if the element at index `i` in `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`, `removed_count` will be incremented by 1, and all other variables will retain their original values as per the precondition. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly reflects the condition under which the if part executes.
