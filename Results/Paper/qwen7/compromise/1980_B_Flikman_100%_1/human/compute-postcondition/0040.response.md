Output State: **`a` is a list containing three integers where the first integer is `n`, the second integer is `f`, and the third integer is `k`; `favorite_value` is equal to `a[f - 1]`; `sorted_a` is a list of the integers in `a` sorted in descending order; `removed_count` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `removed_count = 0` initializes the variable `removed_count` to 0. This does not affect the values of `a`, `favorite_value`, or `sorted_a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
