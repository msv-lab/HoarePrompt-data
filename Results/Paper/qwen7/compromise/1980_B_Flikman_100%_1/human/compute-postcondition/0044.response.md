Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `removed_count` is 1, and the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`.**

Explanation: The line `removed_count += 1` increments the value of `removed_count` by 1. Since `removed_count` was initially 0 (implied from the initial state), it now becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
