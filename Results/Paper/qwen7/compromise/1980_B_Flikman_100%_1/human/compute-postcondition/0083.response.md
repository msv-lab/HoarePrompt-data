Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `k`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `k` must be greater than 2.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - `k` must remain greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

4. **Consider the postcondition**:
   - The postcondition states that if `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is 1. Otherwise, `removed_count` remains unchanged.
   - Since `i` is incremented to 3, we need to check if `sorted_a[3]` is equal to `favorite_value` to determine the new value of `removed_count`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is incremented to 3.
- `k` must still be greater than 2.
- `removed_count` remains unchanged unless `sorted_a[3]` equals `favorite_value`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 3, `k` must be greater than 2, and if `sorted_a[3]` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is 1. Otherwise, `removed_count` remains unchanged.**
