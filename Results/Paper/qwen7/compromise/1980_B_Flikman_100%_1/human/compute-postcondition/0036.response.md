Output State: **`n` is updated to the value of the first input integer, `f` is updated to the value of the second input integer, `k` is updated to the value of the third input integer. The other variables remain unchanged.**

This means that the values of `n`, `f`, and `k` are now set to the integers obtained from the input split, while the initial states of `t`, `a`, `favorite_value`, `sorted_a`, `favorite_count`, and `removed_count` remain the same.
