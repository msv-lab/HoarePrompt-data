Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given code are `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `k-1`. This means `i` will increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `k`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `k` is greater than 0
   - `removed_count` is increased by 1 if `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value`. Otherwise, `i`, `k`, and `removed_count` remain unchanged.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, in the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The value of `removed_count` will depend on the condition inside the loop. However, since we are only asked to adjust the states at the start of the next iteration, we assume that the condition inside the loop has not yet been evaluated.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `k` remains greater than 0.
   - `removed_count` remains unchanged (since we don't know the result of the condition check).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0, and `removed_count` is unchanged.**
