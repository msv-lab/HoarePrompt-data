Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is equal to the original value of `k` (which is greater than 1), `removed_count` is 1 if `sorted_a[2]` equals `favorite_value` otherwise `removed_count` remains unchanged, `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`**.

Explanation: The code `favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)` calculates the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the list `sorted_a` and assigns this count to the variable `favorite_count`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `removed_count` remain unchanged from their initial states unless `sorted_a[2]` equals `favorite_value`, in which case `removed_count` would be set to 1.
