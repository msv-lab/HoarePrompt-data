Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is an input integer, `removed_count` is 1 if `sorted_a[2]` equals `favorite_value` otherwise `removed_count` remains unchanged, `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from input and assigns them to `n`, `f`, and `k`. The values of `i`, `removed_count`, `favorite_count`, `t`, `sorted_a`, and `favorite_value` remain unchanged from their initial states. The values of `n`, `f`, and `k` are now known but their specific values are not provided in the initial state, hence they are described as "an input integer".
