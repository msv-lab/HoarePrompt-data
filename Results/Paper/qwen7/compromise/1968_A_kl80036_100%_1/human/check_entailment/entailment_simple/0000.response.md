Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
- The proposed solution simply sets \( y = x - 1 \).
- Let's analyze the gcd term \(\gcd(x, y)\):
  - If \( y = x - 1 \), then \(\gcd(x, x-1) = 1\) because \(x\) and \(x-1\) are consecutive integers and hence coprime.
- Therefore, \(\gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + (x - 1) = x\).
- This value \(x\) is indeed the maximum possible value since \(\gcd(x, y)\) can be at most 1 (for \(y = x - 1\)), and adding \(y\) gives \(x\).

Given this analysis, the solution provided is correct because it always outputs \(y = x - 1\), which ensures that \(\gcd(x, y) + y = x\), the maximum possible value.

Correctness: **True**
