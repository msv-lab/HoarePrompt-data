You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, the output consists of t lines where each line contains an integer y such that 1 ≤ y ≤ 999. Each y is calculated as x - 1 for the corresponding input x within the range 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for \(1 \le y < x\). Instead, it simply prints \(x - 1\) for each test case, which does not necessarily maximize the expression. 

For example, consider the input \(x = 10\). The program outputs \(y = 9\), but \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\). However, if we choose \(y = 5\), then \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\), which is the same value but might be preferred as it is a simpler choice. 

Thus, the program does not always find the optimal \(y\) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
