Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for \(1 \le y < x\). Instead, it simply prints \(x - 1\) for each test case, which does not necessarily maximize the expression. 

For example, consider the input \(x = 10\). The program outputs \(y = 9\), but \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\). However, if we choose \(y = 5\), then \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\), which is the same value but might be preferred as it is a simpler choice. 

Thus, the program does not always find the optimal \(y\) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
