Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly maximize the value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for all given test cases. The logic in the code simply sets \(y = x - 1\), but this does not guarantee that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) will be maximized.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find a \(y\) such that \(\gcd(x, y)\) is as large as possible while still ensuring that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. One effective way to do this is to check values of \(y\) starting from 1 up to \(x-1\) and find the one that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        max_value = 0
        best_y = 0
        for y in range(1, x):
            current_value = gcd(x, y) + y
            if current_value > max_value:
                max_value = current_value
                best_y = y
        print(best_y)

func()
```

This program iterates through all possible values of \(y\) from 1 to \(x-1\) and finds the one that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
