Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game as described. The logic used to determine the winner based on `(a + b) % 2 == 0` is incorrect. According to the game rules, the player who makes the last move wins, and the key observation is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum `a + b` determines the winner when both players play optimally.

Hereâ€™s the correct approach:

1. If `a + b` is even, Bob will always win because he can mirror Alice's moves until Alice runs out of moves.
2. If `a + b` is odd, Alice will always win because she can force Bob into a losing position.

The provided solution incorrectly splits the input string and converts it to integers, which is unnecessary and complicates the code. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This version directly uses `map` to split and convert the input, simplifying the code and ensuring correctness.
