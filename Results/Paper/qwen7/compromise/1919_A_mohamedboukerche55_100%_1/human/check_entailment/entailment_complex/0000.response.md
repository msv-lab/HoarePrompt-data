Reasoning:
The provided solution checks whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints the corresponding winner based on that condition. However, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. The actual winning strategy for this game is based on the parity of the number of coins each player has, not the sum of the coins.

Here's the correct reasoning:
- If either `a` or `b` is 1, the player with 1 coin will always lose because they cannot remove a coin without making their wallet empty, and then the other player can force a win by swapping and removing the last coin.
- If both `a` and `b` are greater than 1, the player whose turn it is can always force a win by ensuring the other player is left with 1 coin eventually.

Given this, the correct logic should be:
- If `a` or `b` is 1, the player with 1 coin will lose, and the other player will win.
- Otherwise, the player whose turn it is will always win by forcing the opponent into a losing position.

The provided solution incorrectly checks the sum of `a` and `b`. Let's analyze the provided solution:
- The code correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `a` and `b`.
- It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints 'Bob' or 'Alice' accordingly.

This logic is incorrect because:
- The sum being even or odd doesn't determine the winner; the number of coins each player has does.
- For example, if `a = 1` and `b = 2`, the sum is 3 (odd), but Alice will lose because she will be forced to make her wallet empty on her next turn.

Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
