Functionality: **The function reads a number of test cases (`t`) from the user, followed by pairs of non-negative integers (`a` and `b`) for each test case. It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints 'Bob' if the sum is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.**
