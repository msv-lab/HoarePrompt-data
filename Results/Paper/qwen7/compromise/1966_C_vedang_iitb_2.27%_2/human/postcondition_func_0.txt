The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `a`, representing the initial number of stones in each pile. It returns a new list `a_new` where each element (starting from the second) is reduced by the corresponding element in a temporary copy of the sorted and unique version of `a` up to the previous index. The original list `a` and the temporary list `a_temp` remain unchanged.
