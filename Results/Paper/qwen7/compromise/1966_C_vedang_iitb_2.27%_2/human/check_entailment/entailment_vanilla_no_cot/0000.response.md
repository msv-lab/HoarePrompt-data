Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is not used in the main logic and seems unrelated to the game. It processes an array `a` by sorting it, removing duplicates, and then performing some arithmetic operations. However, this function does not contribute to determining the winner of the game.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to solve the problem using recursion but does not correctly simulate the game. Specifically:
   - The base cases for `n == 1` and `n == 2` do not accurately represent the game state.
   - The recursive call `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)` does not account for the fact that the game involves reducing all piles simultaneously by the same amount `k`, which is determined by the smallest non-empty pile.
   - The logic for determining the winner based on `winNext` and `a[0]` is flawed and does not reflect the game rules.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to use the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). The player who faces a position with a Nim-sum of zero will lose if both players play optimally. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def nim_sum(piles):
    xor_sum = 0
    for pile in piles:
        xor_sum ^= pile
    return xor_sum

def determine_winner(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        piles = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if nim_sum(piles) == 0:
            print("Bob")
        else:
            print("Alice")

# Example usage
determine_winner(7)
```

This solution correctly calculates the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not.
