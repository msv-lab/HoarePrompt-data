Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game where players take turns removing a fixed number of stones from each non-empty pile until all piles are empty. The key insight is that the game can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes), but the provided solution uses a different approach involving recursion and memoization.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - This function processes the input array `a` by sorting it, removing duplicates, and then modifying the elements to reflect the difference between consecutive elements after sorting.
   - The purpose of this transformation is unclear in the context of the game's rules and winning strategy. However, it seems to be a preprocessing step before passing the data to `func_2`.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - This function uses recursion to determine the winner based on the number of piles (`n`) and the current state of the piles (`a`).
   - For 1 pile, the player who starts always wins.
   - For 2 piles, the player who starts wins if the first pile has an even number of stones.
   - For more than 2 piles, it checks if the opponent can force a win in the next move. If the opponent cannot force a win or if the first pile is not 1 and the opponent can force a win, the current player can force a win.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The problem requires determining the winner based on the optimal play from both players.
   - The provided solution correctly handles the base cases and recursive logic for determining the winner.
   - The preprocessing step in `func_1` does not seem to affect the correctness of the solution because the final decision is made by `func_2`, which correctly implements the game's logic.

Based on the analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the game's logic and determine the winner based on the optimal play.

Correctness: **True**
