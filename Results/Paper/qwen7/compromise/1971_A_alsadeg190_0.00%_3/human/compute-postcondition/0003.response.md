Output State: The values of `t` and `x` remain unchanged, and the output consists of pairs of integers printed based on the condition in the loop. For each iteration `i` in the range of `x`, if the first integer `x` is greater than the second integer `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`; otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.
