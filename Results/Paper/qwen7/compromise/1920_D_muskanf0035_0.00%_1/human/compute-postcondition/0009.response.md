The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value), and `queries` is a list of positive integers representing the indices for which we need to find the corresponding elements in the final array. After processing the operations, the function returns an empty list for result.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. It processes `n` operations on an array and then returns an empty list.**
