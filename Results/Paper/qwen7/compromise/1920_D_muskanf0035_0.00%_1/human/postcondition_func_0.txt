The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `operations` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers), and `queries` (a list of positive integers). It processes the operations on an initially empty array and then returns an empty list. Regardless of the operations performed or the queries made, the function always returns an empty list.
