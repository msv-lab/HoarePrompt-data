### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function processes the operations and queries.
- **Steps**:
  1. Initializes an empty list `array`.
  2. Iterates through the operations:
     - If the operation type is 1, it appends the value to the `array`.
     - If the operation type is 2, it extends the `array` with `x` copies of itself.
  3. For each query, it appends the `(k-1)`-th element of the `array` to the result list using modulo operation to handle the cyclic nature of the array.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function handles multiple test cases.
- **Steps**:
  1. Reads the number of test cases `t`.
  2. For each test case:
     - Reads the values of `n` and `q`.
     - Reads the operations and stores them in a list.
     - Reads the queries and stores them in a list.
     - Calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
     - Prints the result.

### Analysis:

1. **Operation Processing**:
   - The function correctly handles both types of operations:
     - Appending a single value (`op_type == 1`).
     - Extending the array with `x` copies of itself (`op_type == 2`).

2. **Query Handling**:
   - The function uses the modulo operation to handle the cyclic nature of the array. This is correct because the array can grow very large, and we need to find the correct element within the current size of the array.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the cyclic nature of the array, which is crucial given the large sizes involved.
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results for each query.

However, there is a critical issue with the implementation in `func_1`. Specifically, the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` is problematic. This line attempts to extend the array with `x` copies of itself, but it does not correctly handle the slicing and copying of the array. Instead, it creates a new list with repeated references to the same elements, leading to incorrect behavior when the array grows very large.

### Detailed Explanation:

- When `op_type == 2`, the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` is intended to append `x` copies of the current array to itself. However, this line creates a new list containing references to the existing elements of `array`, rather than creating new copies. As a result, when the array grows, the references become invalid, leading to incorrect behavior.

For example, consider the following sequence of operations:
1. Append 1: `[1]`
2. Append 2: `[1, 2]`
3. Extend with 1 copy: `[1, 2, 1, 2]` (correct)
4. Extend with 2 copies: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]` (incorrect, should be `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`)

### Correct Implementation:

To fix this, we need to create a deep copy of the array before extending it. We can use the `copy` module for this purpose:

```python
import copy

def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend(copy.deepcopy(array))
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result
```

With this corrected implementation, the program will correctly handle the operations and produce the expected results.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the improper handling of array extension. The corrected implementation would be necessary to ensure the program works as intended.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
