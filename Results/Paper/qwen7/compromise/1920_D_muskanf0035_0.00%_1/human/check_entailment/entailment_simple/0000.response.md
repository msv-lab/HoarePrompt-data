Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process the operations and queries as described in the problem statement.
   - The function initializes an empty `array` and `result` list.
   - It iterates through the `operations` list. If the operation type is 1, it appends the value to `array`. If the operation type is 2, it extends `array` by repeating its current content `x` times.
   - After processing all operations, it iterates through the `queries` list and appends the `(k-1)`-th element of `array` to `result`.
   - The function correctly handles the operations and queries as per the problem statement, and the logic is sound.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, then reads the operations and queries.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the results.
   - The function correctly processes each test case as described in the problem statement.

3. **Overall Program Flow**:
   - The main program calls `func_2`, which correctly processes each test case by calling `func_1` and printing the results.
   - The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
