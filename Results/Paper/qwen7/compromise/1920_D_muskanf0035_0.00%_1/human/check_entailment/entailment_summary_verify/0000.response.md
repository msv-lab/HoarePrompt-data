### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Operations:**
   - Type 1: Append an integer \( x \) to the end of the array.
   - Type 2: Append \( x \) copies of the current array to the end of the array.

2. **Queries:**
   - For each query, we need to find the \( k \)-th element of the final array.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  ```python
  def func_1(n, operations, queries):
      array = []
      result = []
      for (op_type, value) in operations:
          if op_type == 1:
              array.append(value)
          else:
              array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
      for k in queries:
          result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
      return result
  ```
  - This function correctly handles the first type of operation (appending an integer).
  - However, for the second type of operation, instead of appending \( x \) copies of the current array, it simply repeats each element of the current array \( x \) times. This is incorrect as per the problem statement.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  ```python
  def func_2():
      t = int(input())
      for _ in range(t):
          (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
          operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
          queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
          result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
          print(*result)
  ```
  - This function reads input and calls `func_1` to get the results, which are then printed.

#### Correctness of the Provided Program:
- The function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the appending of \( x \) copies of the array. As mentioned in the original assessment, it simply repeats each element of the current array \( x \) times, which is incorrect.
- Therefore, the provided program will produce incorrect results for the given problem.

#### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly simulate the operations as required by the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
