### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function processes the operations and queries.
- **Steps**:
  1. Initializes an empty list `array`.
  2. Iterates through the operations:
     - If the operation type is 1, it appends the value to the `array`.
     - If the operation type is 2, it extends the `array` with `x` copies of itself.
  3. For each query, it appends the `(k-1)`-th element of the `array` to the result list using modulo operation to handle the cyclic nature of the array.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function handles multiple test cases.
- **Steps**:
  1. Reads the number of test cases `t`.
  2. For each test case:
     - Reads the values of `n` and `q`.
     - Reads the operations and stores them in a list.
     - Reads the queries and stores them in a list.
     - Calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
     - Prints the result.

### Analysis:

1. **Operation Processing**:
   - The function correctly handles both types of operations:
     - Appending a single value (`op_type == 1`).
     - Extending the array with `x` copies of itself (`op_type == 2`).

2. **Query Handling**:
   - The function uses the modulo operation to handle the cyclic nature of the array. However, there is a critical flaw in this approach.
   - When the array is extended, the new elements are appended to the existing array. The modulo operation will not correctly reflect the position of elements after such extensions, especially when the array grows exponentially.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the cyclic nature of the array for small arrays, but it fails to handle the exponential growth of the array correctly.
   - The modulo operation will only work correctly if the array does not grow too large, but in the given problem, the array can grow to extremely large sizes, making the modulo operation unreliable.

### Example Counterexample:

Consider the following sequence of operations:
- Append 1 (operation 1, value 1)
- Extend with 2 copies (operation 2, value 2)

After these operations, the array becomes `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.

Now, consider a query for the 5th element:
- Using the modulo operation, the 5th element would be the same as the 1st element, which is 1.
- However, the actual 5th element should be 1, but the array structure changes significantly after the extension, and the modulo operation does not capture this correctly.

### Conclusion:

The program incorrectly handles the cyclic nature of the array when the array grows exponentially. The modulo operation is not sufficient to accurately determine the position of elements in the final array.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
