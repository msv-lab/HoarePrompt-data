Reasoning:
- **Function 1 Analysis**: The function `func_1` is supposed to process a series of operations on an initially empty array and then answer queries about the elements in the final array. However, the implementation of `func_1` has several issues:
  - The array is never updated correctly based on the operations. Specifically, when `op_type` is 2, the function should append `x` copies of the current array, but instead, it incorrectly extends the array with its own values.
  - The function always returns an empty list regardless of the operations and queries, which means it does not actually implement the logic required to solve the problem.
- **Function 2 Analysis**: The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and calls `func_1` to process the operations and queries. However, since `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic, the results returned by `func_2` will also be incorrect.
- **Overall Program Analysis**: Given that `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to build the array based on the operations, the entire program will produce incorrect results for the queries.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the core function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to build the array based on the given operations. As a result, the queries cannot be answered correctly.
