Output State: **`r` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `k` is an integer, `rem` is 0, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `m` is the input value, `n` is the integer input from the second line, `k` is the integer input from the second line, `a` is a list of sorted integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The line `rem = 0` initializes the variable `rem` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `r`, `k`, `ii`, `m`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
