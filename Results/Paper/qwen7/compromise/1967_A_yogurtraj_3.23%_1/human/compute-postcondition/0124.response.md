Output State: **`i` is 2; `k` is adjusted based on the value of `i` and the elements of array `a`; `r` is `a[2] + k // (2 + 1)`, `rem` is `k % 3`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `rem` as `k % (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 2, `rem` is calculated as `k % 3`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `k` is still adjusted based on the value of `i` and the elements of array `a`, and `r` is still `a[2] + k // (2 + 1)`.
