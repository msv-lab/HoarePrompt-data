Output State: **`i` is `n - 1 - y`, `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, and `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The code `y = n - 1 - i` updates the value of `y` to be `n - 1 - i`. The other variables (`i`, `ii`, `n`, `a`, `r`, and `rem`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state of `i` is `n - 1 - y`, while the rest of the variables retain their original conditions and values.
