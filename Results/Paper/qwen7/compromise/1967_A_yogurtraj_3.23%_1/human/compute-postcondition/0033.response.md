Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is `n - 1 - y`, `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, and `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned, we assume it is breaking out of the most internal one. All other variables retain their initial or calculated states.
