Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is true, then `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]))`, `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`.
