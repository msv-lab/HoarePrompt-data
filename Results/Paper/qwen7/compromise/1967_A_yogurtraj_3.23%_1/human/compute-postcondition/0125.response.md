Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is adjusted based on the value of `i` and the elements of array `a`; `r` is `a[2] + k // (2 + 1)`, `rem` is `k % 3`, `y` is `n - 1 - 2`**.

This means that the value of `i` remains 2, `k` remains adjusted based on the value of `i` and the elements of array `a`, `r` remains `a[2] + k // (2 + 1)`, `rem` remains `k % 3`, and `y` is now set to `n - 1 - 2`.
