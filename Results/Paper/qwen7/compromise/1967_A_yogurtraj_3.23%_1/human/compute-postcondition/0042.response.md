To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the expression in the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`y`**: 
   - `y` is defined as `n - 1 - i` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, or `0` otherwise.
   - Here, `i` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 1, and `a` is a list of sorted integers.
   - `k` is a value that is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 2] - a[i + 1])`.

2. **`ii`**: 
   - `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.

3. **`n`**: 
   - `n` is an integer greater than 1.

4. **`a`**: 
   - `a` is a list of sorted integers.

5. **`r`**: 
   - `r` is defined as `a[i + 2]`.

6. **`k`**: 
   - `k` is initially some value, but it is being decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 2] - a[i + 1])`.

### Expression in the Print Statement:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
```

- **`(r - 1) * n + 1`**: This part calculates `(a[i + 2] - 1) * n + 1`.
- **`rem`**: This variable is not defined in the initial state, so we need to assume its value. Since no value is provided for `rem`, we'll consider it as an undefined variable.
- **`y`**: As described above, `y` could be `n - 1 - i` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is true, or `0` otherwise.

### Determining the Value of `y`:
- To determine the value of `y`, we need to check the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`.
- If this condition is true, then `y = n - 1 - i`.
- If the condition is false, then `y = 0`.

### Final Output:
Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for `rem` and the exact conditions, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **(a[i + 2] - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y (where y is either n - 1 - i if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, or 0 otherwise, and rem is an undefined variable)**
