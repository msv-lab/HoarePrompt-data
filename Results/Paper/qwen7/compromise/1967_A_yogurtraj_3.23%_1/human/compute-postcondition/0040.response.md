To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the expression in the `print` statement step by step.

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `y` is defined as `n - 1 - i` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `y` is `0`.
   - `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list of sorted integers.
   - `r` is defined as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - `k` is a non-zero integer.

2. **Expression in Print Statement:**
   - The expression being printed is `(r - 1) * n + 1`.

3. **Determine `r`:**
   - Since `r` is defined as `a[n - 1] + k // n`, we need to know the value of `a[n - 1]` and `k // n`.
   - `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the list `a`.
   - `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.

4. **Expression Simplification:**
   - The expression `(r - 1) * n + 1` simplifies to:
     \[
     (a[n - 1] + \text{floor}(k / n) - 1) * n + 1
     \]
   - This can be further simplified to:
     \[
     a[n - 1] * n + \text{floor}(k / n) * n - n + 1
     \]

5. **Final Output:**
   - The expression evaluates to `a[n - 1] * n + \text{floor}(k / n) * n - n + 1`.

Given the initial state, the exact values of `a[n - 1]` and `k // n` are not specified, but we can express the final result in terms of these values.

Output: **a[n - 1] * n + floor(k / n) * n - n + 1**
