Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, so the loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `y` is either `n - 1 - ii` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, or `0` otherwise.
   - `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `k` is updated to the original value of `k` minus `(ii + 1) * (a[ii + 1] - a[ii])` if the condition is false.
   - `a` is a list of sorted integers.
   - `r` is the second element of list `a`.
   - `rem` is `0`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increases by `1` each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `n - 2` (because the loop runs up to `n - 1`).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by `1` and should still be less than `n - 1`.

Given this information, let's update the states:

- `i` will be incremented by `1` from `n - 2` to `n - 1`.
- `n` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`y` is either `n - 1 - ii` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, or `0` otherwise, `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is updated to the original value of `k` minus `(ii + 1) * (a[ii + 1] - a[ii])` if the condition is false, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is the second element of list `a`, and `rem` is `0`. `i` is `n - 1`.**
