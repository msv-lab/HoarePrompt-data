Output State: **`k` is 0, `r` is `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `0 % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block without changing the values of the variables `k`, `r`, `rem`, and `y`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged, and we simply indicate that we have broken out of the loop or conditional block.
