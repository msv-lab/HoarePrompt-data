Output State: **`i` is 2, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[2] + k // (i + 1)` to the variable `r`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression simplifies to `a[2] + k // 3`. The values of `i` and `r` are updated, while the precondition that `n` must be at least 2 remains unchanged.
