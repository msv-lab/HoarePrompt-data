Output State: **`ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of sorted integers.**

The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `ii`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The list `a` is updated to contain its elements in sorted order.
