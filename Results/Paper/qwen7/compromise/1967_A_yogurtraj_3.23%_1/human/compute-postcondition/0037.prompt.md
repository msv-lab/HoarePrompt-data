Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `y` is 0, `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is equal to the first element of list `a`, `rem` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
        r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
        rem = k % (i + 1)
        y = n - 1 - i
        k = 0
        break
    else:
        k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
        r = a[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `y` is either `n - 1 - ii` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, or `0` otherwise. `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is updated to the original value of `k` minus `(ii + 1) * (a[ii + 1] - a[ii])` if the condition is false, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is the second element of list `a`, and `rem` is `0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is updated to the original value of `k` minus `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `y` is `n - 1 - i`. Otherwise, `i` is `n - 1`, `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is now `a[i + 1]`, and `rem` is `0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is an integer, `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is either `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` with `rem` being `k % (i + 1)` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, or `a[i + 2]` if the condition is not met, and `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 2] - a[i + 1])` if the else part is executed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
