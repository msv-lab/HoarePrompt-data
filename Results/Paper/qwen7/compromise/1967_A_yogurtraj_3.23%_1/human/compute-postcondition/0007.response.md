Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(0, n - 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly given an initial value in the loop head, but it will start from 0 as per the `range(0, n - 1)` function.
   - `n` is given as an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once (since `i` starts from 0).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: 
   - Since `i` starts from 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

5. **Consider other variables**: The other variables (`y`, `ii`, `k`, `a`, `r`, and `rem`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`y` is 0, `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is equal to the first element of list `a`, `rem` is 0**
