Output State: **`i` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; the condition ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k) is true.**

This output state reflects that the variable `r` has been updated to the value of `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, while the other variables and the condition remain unchanged from the initial state.
