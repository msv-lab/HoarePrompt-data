Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `rem` is `0 % (i + 1)`, `n` is the same, `y` is `n - 1 - i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or the most internal if statement. Since no specific values were provided for `i`, `n`, and `y`, they remain as described in the initial state. The `rem` variable is calculated as `0 % (i + 1)`, which remains unchanged because `k` is 0.
