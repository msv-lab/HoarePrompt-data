Output State: All iterations of the loop have completed. At this point, `k` is an integer that could either be 0 or a positive value depending on the distribution of values in the list `a` and the value of `n`. If `k` is not equal to 0, `r` will be set to `a[n-1] + k // n`. If `k` is equal to 0, `r` will be the last value it was assigned within the loop, which is `a[n-1] + k // n` when `k` was still positive but has since been fully distributed across the iterations. The variable `y` will hold the value of `n - 1 - i` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` was met during any iteration, otherwise it will be 0. The variable `rem` will be 0 as it is only assigned a value when `k` is reduced below the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list `a`. The variable `ii` will be 100, indicating that all 100 test cases have been processed.
