Output State: **`y` is `n - 1 - ii`, `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is equal to `a[ii] + k // (ii + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (ii + 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not affect the values of the variables `y`, `ii`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, or `rem`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged, and the only effect is that the program exits the loop or conditional block it was in.
