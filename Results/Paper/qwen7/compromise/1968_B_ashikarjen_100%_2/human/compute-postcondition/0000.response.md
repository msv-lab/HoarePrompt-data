Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, n is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input, m is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the input using `input().split()`, which splits the input into two parts based on spaces, and then converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, so it is still an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. The values of `n` and `m` are updated based on the input, but their exact values depend on the user's input.
