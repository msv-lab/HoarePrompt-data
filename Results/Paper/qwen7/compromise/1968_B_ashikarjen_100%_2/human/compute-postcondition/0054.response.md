Functionality: **The function reads two binary strings `a` and `b` along with their lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then counts the number of positions where the characters of `a` match the characters of `b`. If a match is found, the index in `b` is incremented. After processing all characters in `a`, the function prints the count of matches and returns None.**
