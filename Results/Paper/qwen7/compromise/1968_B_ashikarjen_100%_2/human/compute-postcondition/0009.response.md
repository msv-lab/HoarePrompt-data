Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 1, and `b[1]` must not be equal to `a[i]`**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
