Output State: **`j` is `previous_j + 2` where `previous_j` is less than `m - 1` and `b[previous_j + 2]` is not equal to `a[i]`**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial condition that `j` is `previous_j + 1` where `previous_j` is less than `m - 1` and `b[previous_j + 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, after executing the code, `j` becomes `previous_j + 2`. The conditions that `previous_j` is less than `m - 1` and `b[previous_j + 2]` is not equal to `a[i]` remain valid as no changes were made to `previous_j` or `b` and `a`.
