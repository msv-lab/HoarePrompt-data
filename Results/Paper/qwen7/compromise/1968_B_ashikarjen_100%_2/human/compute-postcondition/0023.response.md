Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `j`, `m`, `b[j]`, and `a[i]`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is increased by 1.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `b` is a non-empty string.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `i` is `m + 1`.

3. **Determine Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]` must be true.
   - Since `j` is increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is now `previous_j + 1`.
   - To satisfy `j < m`, `previous_j + 1` must still be less than `m`. This means `previous_j` must be less than `m - 1`.
   - To satisfy `b[j] != a[i]`, `b[previous_j + 1]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

Given these conditions, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to ensure the loop continues.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is `previous_j + 1` where `previous_j` is less than `m - 1` and `b[previous_j + 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`**
