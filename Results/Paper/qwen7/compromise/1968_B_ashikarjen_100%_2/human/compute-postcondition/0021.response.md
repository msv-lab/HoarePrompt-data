Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.
2. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `j`, `m`, `b[j]`, and `a[i]`.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is a positive integer
- `b` is a non-empty string
- `j` is equal to `m`
- `k` is 0
- `i` is `m + 1`

We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `j < m and b[j] != a[i]` must be true.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition `j < m`**:
   - Currently, `j` is equal to `m`. Therefore, `j < m` is false.
   - To make `j < m` true, we need to change `j` to be less than `m`.

2. **Condition `b[j] != a[i]`**:
   - Since `j` is equal to `m`, `b[j]` is equivalent to `b[m]`.
   - `a[i]` is `a[m + 1]`.
   - We need to ensure that `b[m]` is not equal to `a[m + 1]` for the loop to execute.

### Adjusting the States:

- **Adjust `j` to be less than `m`**: We can set `j` to any value less than `m`.
- **Ensure `b[j] != a[i]`**: We need to make sure that `b[m]` is not equal to `a[m + 1]`.

Since we don't have specific values for `b` and `a`, we can assume that `b[m]` and `a[m + 1]` are different. However, if they were the same, we would need to adjust them to be different.

### Final Answer:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` must be less than `m`, `k` is 0, `i` is `m + 1`**

This ensures that the loop condition `j < m and b[j] != a[i]` can be satisfied for the first iteration.
