You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
    return



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two binary strings `a` and `b` along with their lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then counts the number of positions where the characters of `a` match the characters of `b`. If a match is found, the index in `b` is incremented. After processing all characters in `a`, the function prints the count of matches and returns None.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1()` which is intended to handle the logic for determining the maximum prefix length.
   - The main function reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one.

2. **Function `func_1()` Logic:**
   - It reads the lengths `n` and `m` of the binary strings `a` and `b`.
   - It then reads the strings `a` and `b`.
   - It initializes `k` to 0, which will store the maximum prefix length.
   - It uses a variable `j` to traverse through string `b`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`, where `i` represents the current character in string `a`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current character `a[i]` matches any character in the remaining part of string `b` starting from index `j`.
   - If a match is found, it increments both `k` and `j` to move to the next character in both strings.
   - If no match is found, it breaks out of the loop since further characters in `a` cannot form a subsequence of `b`.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, it prints the value of `k`, which is the maximum prefix length.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     5 4
     10011
     1110
     ```
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: The prefix "10" of "10011" is a subsequence of "1110". The program correctly outputs `2`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     3 3
     100
     110
     ```
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: The prefix "10" of "100" is a subsequence of "110". The program correctly outputs `2`.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     1 3
     1
     111
     ```
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: The prefix "1" of "1" is a subsequence of "111". The program correctly outputs `1`.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     4 4
     1011
     1111
     ```

   - Explanation: The prefix "1" of "1011" is a subsequence of "1111". The program correctly outputs `1`.

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     3 5
     100
     11010
     ```
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Explanation: The prefix "100" of "100" is a subsequence of "11010". The program correctly outputs `3`.

6. **Example 6:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     3 1
     100
     0
     ```
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: There is no subsequence of "100" in "0". The program correctly outputs `0`.
