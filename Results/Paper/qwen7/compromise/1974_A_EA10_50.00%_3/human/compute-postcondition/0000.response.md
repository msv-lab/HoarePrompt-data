Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. The other variables (`x` and `y`) are not mentioned in the initial state and are not affected by the given code snippet.
