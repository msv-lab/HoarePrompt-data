Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens.
- Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means each screen can hold up to 15 icons (5 * 3).

### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - `a` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, we read `x` and `y`.

2. **Initial Calculation:**
   - `z = (y + 1) // 2`: This calculates the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the screens. Since each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, `(y + 1) // 2` gives the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can fit without exceeding the screen limit.
   - `m = 15 * z - y * 4`: This calculates the remaining space after placing all possible 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells, so `y * 4` is subtracted from the total capacity of `z` screens.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - The condition `if m < a:` checks if there is enough space left to fit the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - If not, we add the necessary number of additional screens to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons using the formula `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`.

### Correctness Check:
- The logic seems to handle the placement of 2x2 icons correctly.
- However, the final calculation for the remaining 1x1 icons might be incorrect. The formula `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` does not account for the fact that each additional screen can hold up to 15 icons, and it should be adjusted to ensure the correct number of screens is calculated.

### Example Analysis:
Let's manually check a few examples to see if the program works as expected.

#### Example 1:
- Input: `1 1`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Calculation:
  - `z = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 1 * 4 = 11`
  - Remaining 1x1 icons: `1 - 11 = -10` (This is incorrect, should be 1 - 11 + 15 = 5)
  - Additional screens: `(1 + 5 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1`
- Output: `1` (Correct)

#### Example 2:
- Input: `7 2`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Calculation:
  - `z = (2 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 2 * 4 = 7`
  - Remaining 1x1 icons: `7 - 7 = 0`
  - Additional screens: `(7 + 0 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1`
- Output: `1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The given program has a logical error in the calculation of the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. The correct approach should ensure that the remaining 1x1 icons are distributed across the minimum number of additional screens.

Therefore, the given program is **Incorrect**.

**Correctness: False**
