Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Specifically, the logic for constructing an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences is flawed. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Subsequences**: The program attempts to calculate the number of increasing subsequences using powers of 2, which is not a correct approach for all values of `X`. It tries to break down `X-1` into a sum of distinct powers of 2, but this does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

2. **Array Construction Logic**: The construction of the array `ansv` does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`. The logic for appending elements to `ansv` does not align with the requirement to generate exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

To properly solve this problem, one would need to use combinatorial methods or dynamic programming to construct the array. A more appropriate approach would involve generating a sequence where the number of ways to choose increasing subsequences matches the target `X`.

Here is a conceptual outline of a correct solution:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use a DP table to keep track of how many ways to form a certain number of increasing subsequences.
2. **Constructing the Array**: Based on the DP table, construct the array that meets the requirement.

Given the complexity, a fully correct implementation would be quite involved and cannot be accurately reproduced here without significant development. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect for the given problem.
