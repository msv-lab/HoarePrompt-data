### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - The number of increasing subsequences is given by \(X\).
   - The array must have at most 200 elements.
   - If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The number of increasing subsequences of an array can be determined by its structure.
   - A key observation is that the number of increasing subsequences of an array can be represented using powers of 2. Specifically, if an array has \(k\) distinct elements, the number of increasing subsequences is the sum of binomial coefficients \(\sum_{i=0}^{k} \binom{k}{i}\), which simplifies to \(2^k\).

3. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The code attempts to decompose \(X-1\) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1.
   - It constructs the array based on these powers of 2.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly handle all cases, especially when \(X\) cannot be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1.

4. **Issues in the Given Code:**
   - The code assumes that \(X-1\) can always be decomposed into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1, which is not always true.
   - For example, if \(X = 13\), the correct decomposition would be \(13 - 1 = 12 = 2^3 + 2^2\), leading to an array of length 5 with values `[3, 2, 0, 0, 0]`.
   - However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this case and instead appends unnecessary values.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to correctly decompose \(X-1\) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1.
   - Construct the array based on this decomposition.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code provides insights into the state of the program at various points, but it incorrectly concludes that the code always handles the decomposition correctly.
   - The annotated code suggests that the state `subseq_lens` is `[10, 10]` for \(X = 489\), which is incorrect. The correct decomposition for \(X = 489\) should be \(489 - 1 = 488 = 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0\).

7. **Correct Solution:**
   - The corrected code provided in the original assessment correctly decomposes \(X-1\) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1.
   - It then constructs the array based on this decomposition, ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences matches \(X\).

### Conclusion:
The given code has issues in handling the decomposition of \(X-1\) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1. The annotated code incorrectly concludes that the given code is correct. The corrected code provided in the original assessment is the correct approach.

**Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
