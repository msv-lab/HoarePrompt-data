Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, but it does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not consider the case where `X` is a prime number greater than 2. For such values of `X`, it is impossible to construct an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences because `X` cannot be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1 (which is how the program constructs the array).

For example, if `X = 3`, the program will attempt to construct an array but will fail to do so correctly. The correct approach would be to recognize that for `X = 3`, we can use an array like `[0, 1, 0]`, which has exactly 3 increasing subsequences. However, the provided program does not handle this case and will output `-1` instead.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
