### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - The number of increasing subsequences is given by \(X\).
   - The array must have at most 200 elements.
   - If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The number of increasing subsequences of an array can be determined by its structure.
   - A key observation is that the number of increasing subsequences of an array can be represented using powers of 2. Specifically, if an array has \(k\) distinct elements, the number of increasing subsequences is the sum of binomial coefficients \(\sum_{i=0}^{k} \binom{k}{i}\), which simplifies to \(2^k\).

3. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The code attempts to decompose \(X-1\) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1.
   - It constructs the array based on these powers of 2.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly handle all cases, especially when \(X\) cannot be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1.

4. **Issues in the Given Code:**
   - The code assumes that \(X-1\) can always be decomposed into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1, which is not always true.
   - For example, if \(X = 13\), the correct decomposition would be \(13 - 1 = 12 = 2^3 + 2^2\), leading to an array of length 5 with values `[3, 2, 0, 0, 0]`.
   - However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this case and instead appends unnecessary values.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to correctly decompose \(X-1\) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1.
   - Construct the array based on this decomposition.

6. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `X` is an integer within the range 2 to 10^18.
   - It calculates a sequence of integers based on certain conditions and prints the length of this sequence followed by the sequence itself.
   - The function does not return any value but prints the final sequence length and the sequence.

7. **Corrected Code:**
   - The corrected code provided in the original assessment addresses the issue of decomposing \(X-1\) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1.
   - It uses bitwise operations to correctly handle the decomposition.
   - The code constructs the array based on the decomposition and ensures that the array length is within the limit of 200.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identified the issues in the given code and provided a corrected version. The corrected code handles the decomposition of \(X-1\) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1 and constructs the array accordingly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
