Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `x`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as the input is taken for `x`. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `x` is set to the integer value input by the user.
