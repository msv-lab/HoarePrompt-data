Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State: `i` is 2, `ansv` contains the elements `[10, 10, 10, 10, 10]`
2. The `print` statement is `print(ansv[i], end=' ')`
3. Here, `ansv` is a list with elements `[10, 10, 10, 10, 10]`.
4. The index `i` is 2.
5. In Python, list indices start from 0, so `ansv[2]` refers to the third element in the list (since indexing starts at 0).
6. The third element in the list `ansv` is `10`.
7. The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

Therefore, the output will be `10 ` (the number 10 followed by a space).

Output: **10 **
