Postcondition: **`i` is 10, `mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 489, and `subseq_lens` is a list containing [10]**.

This means that after executing the if-else block, the variable `i` will be set to 10, `mx` will be updated to 10, `t` will remain within the range of 1 to 1000, `x` will be 489, and `subseq_lens` will be a list containing the single element [10].
