Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is set to 1.
2. `ansv` is a list containing the elements `[10, 10, 10, 10, 10]`.
3. The `print` statement accesses the element at index `i` in the list `ansv` and prints it with `end=' '` to ensure there's no newline after the printed value.

Given that `i` is 1, the element at index 1 of the list `ansv` is 10.

Output: **10**
