Output State: `i` is 0, `mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 489, and `subseq_lens` is a list containing [10, 10].

Explanation: After the first three iterations, the loop continues to run until `x` becomes 0 or `i` becomes 0. From the given information, after the third iteration, `i` is either 0 or 10. If `i` is 0, the loop breaks because the condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` fails. Since `x` is 489, which is less than 511, it implies that `i` cannot be 10 in the next iteration. Therefore, `i` must be 0 in the final iteration, and the loop breaks. The value of `mx` remains 10 as it was updated to 10 in the second iteration and no subsequent `i` value is greater than 10. The value of `x` remains 489 as it was reduced to this value after the third iteration and no further reduction occurs. The list `subseq_lens` contains the values appended during each iteration, so it will be [10, 10] after the third iteration and no further updates occur.
