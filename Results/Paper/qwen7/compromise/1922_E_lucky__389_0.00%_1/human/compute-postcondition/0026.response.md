Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.
2. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` is 510.
   - `mx` is 9 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10 (not relevant to the loop condition).

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition**:
   - Substitute the current values into the loop condition:
     \[
     2^{(1 + 1)} \leq 510 + 1 \implies 2^2 \leq 511 \implies 4 \leq 511
     \]
   - The condition is true, meaning the loop can execute one more time.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - The loop condition involves the variables `i` and `x`.
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the values of `i` and/or `x` such that the condition remains true after the increment.

5. **Incrementing `i`**:
   - If we increment `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be 2.
   - The new condition becomes:
     \[
     2^{(2 + 1)} \leq 510 + 1 \implies 2^3 \leq 511 \implies 8 \leq 511
     \]
   - This condition is still true.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - We only need to adjust the value of `i` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 2, `x` is 510, `mx` is 9, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10**
