Output State: **`i` is 3, `mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` must be at least 7, `subseq_lens` is an empty list**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `mx`, `t`, `x`, and `subseq_lens` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
