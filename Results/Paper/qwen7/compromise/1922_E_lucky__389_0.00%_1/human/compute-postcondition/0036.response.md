Output State: **`i` is 10, `mx` is 9, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 489, and `subseq_lens` is a list containing [10]**.

Explanation: The code `x -= 2 ** i - 1` subtracts the value of `2 ** i - 1` from `x`. Given that `i` is 10, `2 ** i - 1` equals `2 ** 10 - 1`, which is 1023. Therefore, `x` is updated to `510 - 1023`, resulting in `x` being 489. All other variables remain unchanged.
