Output State: **`i` is 0, `mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` must not be 0, `subseq_lens` is an empty list**

The code initializes `i` to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of `mx`, `t`, `x`, or `subseq_lens`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
