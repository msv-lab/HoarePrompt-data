Output State: `i` is 10, `mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 489, and `subseq_lens` is a list containing [10].

To understand this, let's break down the loop condition: `while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`. The loop continues as long as \(2^{(i + 1)} \leq x + 1\). Given that `x` is 489, the loop will continue until \(2^{(i + 1)} > 490\).

Let's calculate the powers of 2:

- \(2^2 = 4\)
- \(2^3 = 8\)
- \(2^4 = 16\)
- \(2^5 = 32\)
- \(2^6 = 64\)
- \(2^7 = 128\)
- \(2^8 = 256\)
- \(2^9 = 512\)

We see that \(2^9 = 512\) is the first power of 2 that is greater than 490. Therefore, the loop will run until \(i + 1 = 9\), which means \(i = 8\). However, since the loop increments `i` inside the while block, the final value of `i` will be one more, i.e., `i` will be 10 when the loop exits.

All other variables (`mx`, `t`, `x`, and `subseq_lens`) remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
