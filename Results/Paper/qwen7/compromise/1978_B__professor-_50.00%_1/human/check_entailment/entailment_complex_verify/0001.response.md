### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case.

2. **Condition Analysis**:
   - If `b <= a`, the program prints `n * a`. This means that selling all buns at the usual price `a` is the best option since the modified price `b` is not beneficial.
   - If `b - a >= n`, the program calculates the profit using the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - (n-1)`.
   - Otherwise, the program uses the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` to calculate the profit. This formula is derived from the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic sequence with the first term `(b - (k-1))` and the last term `b`.

3. **Formula Verification**:
   - For `b - a >= n`, the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)` is correct because it represents the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b` down to `b - (n-1)`.
   - For `b - a < n`, the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` is also correct because it accounts for the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence plus the usual price for the remaining buns.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `b <= a` and when `b - a >= n` correctly.
   - The program also handles the general case where `b - a < n` correctly.

However, there is a potential issue with the formula used when `b - a < n`. Specifically, the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` might not always yield the correct profit. Let's consider a specific example to verify this.

Consider the test case:
```
5 5 9
```
- Here, `n = 5`, `a = 5`, and `b = 9`.
- Since `b - a = 4 < n`, we should use the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.
- Plugging in the values, we get:
  \[
  \text{Profit} = \int((9 - 5) / 2 * (9 - 5 + 1) + 5 * 5) = \int(4 / 2 * 5 + 25) = \int(10 + 25) = 35
  \]
- This matches the expected output, so the formula seems correct in this case.

Now, let's consider another test case:
```
5 5 11
```
- Here, `n = 5`, `a = 5`, and `b = 11`.
- Since `b - a = 6 > n`, we should use the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`.
- Plugging in the values, we get:
  \[
  \text{Profit} = \int((2 * 11 - 5 + 1) * 5 / 2) = \int((22 - 5 + 1) * 5 / 2) = \int(18 * 5 / 2) = \int(45)
  \]
- This matches the expected output, so the formula seems correct in this case as well.

Finally, let's consider the general case:
```
10 10 5
```
- Here, `n = 10`, `a = 10`, and `b = 5`.
- Since `b <= a`, we should use the formula `n * a`.
- Plugging in the values, we get:
  \[
  \text{Profit} = 10 * 10 = 100
  \]
- This matches the expected output, so the formula seems correct in this case as well.

Given the analysis, the program appears to handle all scenarios correctly according to the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and test cases.
