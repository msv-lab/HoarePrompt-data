Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) represents the count of numbers in the sequence that are 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively, and the sum of p_i (i.e., p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4) is equal to the initial length of the sequence.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
        cnt += 1
    for x in a:
        cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers, and `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `a` is an empty list or has no elements left to iterate over; `cnt` is increased by the floor division of each element in `a` by 2 for each iteration the loop runs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers with no specific length requirement, the first three elements of `a` must all be odd; `cnt` is increased by the floor division of each element `x` by 2 for every iteration, and `cnt` is now equal to the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements in `a` that were processed during the loop's execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
