Output State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `cnt` is increased by the floor division of each element in `a` by 2 for each iteration the loop runs.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into a list of integers. This changes the value of `a` to a list of integers. The initial state of `cnt` being increased by the floor division of each element in `a` by 2 for each iteration the loop runs remains unchanged because the code does not execute the loop or perform any operations on `cnt`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `a` and retains the description of how `cnt` will be updated once the loop runs.
