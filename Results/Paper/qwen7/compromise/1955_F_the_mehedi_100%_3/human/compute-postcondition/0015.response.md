Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `cnt` is `cnt + math.floor(x / 2)`**.

Explanation: The code `cnt += math.floor(x / 2)` increments the value of `cnt` by the floor division of `x` by 2. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `x`, the updated value of `cnt` is expressed as `cnt` plus the floor division of `x` by 2. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.
