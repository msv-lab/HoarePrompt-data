You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) represents the count of numbers in the sequence that are 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively, and the sum of p_i (i.e., p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4) is equal to the initial length of the sequence.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `a` is an empty list, and `cnt` is the total sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in `a` that were processed during the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where for each case, it reads counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. It then calculates the sum of the floor division of each number by 2 and prints this sum for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the calculated sum for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.
   
2. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `a` is a list containing these four integers.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times Bob can win.

3. **Winning Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If they are, it increments `cnt` by 1. This is incorrect because the problem states that Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers is non-zero. The condition `a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1` does not directly relate to the XOR condition.

4. **Counting Removals:**
   - The program then iterates over each element in `a` and adds `math.floor(x / 2)` to `cnt`. This part is also incorrect because it does not reflect the strategy of removing numbers to maximize Bob's wins based on the XOR condition.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints `cnt`, which is not correctly calculated according to the problem requirements.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to understand how to maximize Bob's wins by strategically removing numbers. Here’s a corrected version of the logic:

1. **Initial XOR Calculation:**
   - Calculate the initial XOR of all numbers in the sequence.
   - Use the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s to compute the initial XOR.

2. **Strategic Removal:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence has a zero XOR.
   - The number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of ways to make the XOR zero by removing numbers.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ones, twos, threes, fours = a
        # Initial XOR calculation
        xor = ones ^ (twos << 1) ^ (threes << 2) ^ (fours << 3)
        
        # Count the number of ways to make the XOR zero
        # This is equivalent to the sum of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s
        cnt = ones + twos + threes
        
        print(cnt)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. The corrected approach involves calculating the initial XOR and then determining the number of ways to make the XOR zero by removing numbers.

**Correctness: False**
