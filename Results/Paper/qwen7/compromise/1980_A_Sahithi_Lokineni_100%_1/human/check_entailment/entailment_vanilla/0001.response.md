### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that he can conduct `m` rounds, with each round requiring at least one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').

2. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the number of problems in the bank (`n`) and the number of upcoming rounds (`m`). It also reads the string of difficulty levels (`s`).

3. **Counting Problems**: The program uses a dictionary (`d`) to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the input string. This part is correctly implemented using `defaultdict`.

4. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed**: 
   - The program initializes the counts for each difficulty level to zero.
   - It then iterates over the input string and increments the count for each difficulty level.
   - After counting, it calculates how many additional problems are needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds. If the count for a difficulty level is less than `m`, it adds `m - count` to the answer.

5. **Output**: The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the number of problems in the bank is less than required for `m` rounds.
   - It correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level.

7. **Function `func_1()`**: This function is unused in the main logic and does not affect the correctness of the program.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
