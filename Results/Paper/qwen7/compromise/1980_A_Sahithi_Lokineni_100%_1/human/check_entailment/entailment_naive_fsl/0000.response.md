Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed. Specifically, the program initializes `d` using `defaultdict(default_value)` but does not define `default_value`. This leads to a `NameError` since `default_value` is undefined. Additionally, the logic for calculating the number of additional problems needed is flawed. The program checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than or equal to `m` and adds `m - d[val]` to `ans`, which is incorrect because it does not account for the total number of rounds `m`.

To fix this, the program should ensure that each difficulty level has at least `m` problems. Here's a corrected version:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    d = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in d.keys():
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version initializes `d` with `defaultdict(int)` and correctly calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds.
