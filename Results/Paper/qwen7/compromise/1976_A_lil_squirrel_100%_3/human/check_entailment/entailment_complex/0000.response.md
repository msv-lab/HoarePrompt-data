Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to check if a password meets the specified criteria. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Separation of Characters**: The function `func_1` correctly separates the characters in the password into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits.

2. **Sorting Check**: The function checks if both `letters` and `digits` are sorted in non-decreasing order using the `sorted()` function. This ensures that the letters and digits are in the correct order.

3. **Digit After Letter Check**: The function iterates through the password and checks if there is any instance where a letter is immediately followed by a digit. If such an instance is found, the function returns 'NO'.

4. **Final Return**: If the function completes the iteration without finding any violations, it returns 'YES', indicating that the password is strong according to the given rules.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the function correctly implements the necessary checks to determine if a password is strong. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
