Output State: **cur_arr is a list of integers representing a segment of the array a, bit is an integer representing the current bit position being considered, and x is an integer representing the favorite number; new_arr is an empty list.**

The code initializes `new_arr` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, or `x`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
