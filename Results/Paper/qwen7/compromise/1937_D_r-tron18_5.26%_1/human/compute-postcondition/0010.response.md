Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s1` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and an integer `n`. It calculates and returns a list `ans` where each element is determined based on the balance of '<' and '>' in `s1` relative to `n`. The final state of the program includes an output list `ans` containing the calculated values, while internal lists `preOne`, `pre`, and `suffZero` are emptied, and `totalOne` is set to 0.**
