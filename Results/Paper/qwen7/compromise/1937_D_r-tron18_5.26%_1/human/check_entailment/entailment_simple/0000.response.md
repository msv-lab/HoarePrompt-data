### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Purpose**:
   - `func_1`: This function calculates the difference between the last element of a list `arr` and the element at a specific index determined by `times`. However, there is an issue with the logic here, as `n` is not defined in the function and should be replaced with `l` (the length of `arr`).
   - `func_2`: This function processes the input string `s1` to determine the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. It uses prefix sums and suffix sums to efficiently compute these times.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program iterates over test cases, reads the grid size `n` and the grid configuration `s1`, and calls `func_2` to get the results.
   - The results are then printed out.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - **Incorrect Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is incorrectly using `n` instead of `l` (the length of `arr`). This could lead to incorrect calculations.
   - **Logic in `func_2`**: The logic in `func_2` seems correct based on the problem description and the expected behavior of the pinball. It correctly uses prefix and suffix sums to determine the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.

4. **Assumption Validity**:
   - Given that the problem description and the expected output match the logic implemented in `func_2`, and assuming `func_1` is correctly implemented (with `n` replaced by `l`), the program should work as intended.

### Conclusion:
- The primary issue lies with `func_1`, but assuming `func_1` is corrected, the overall logic of `func_2` and the main program is correct.

### Correctness:
- **True** (assuming `func_1` is corrected).

Therefore, the final answer is:
```
Correctness: **True**
