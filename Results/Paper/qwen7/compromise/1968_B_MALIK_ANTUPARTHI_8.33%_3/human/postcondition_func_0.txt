The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts two integers \( n \) and \( m \) (such that \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \)), and two binary strings \( a \) and \( b \) (where \( a \) has length \( n \) and \( b \) has length \( m \)). For each test case, it finds the smallest index \( k \) in string \( b \) where the substring of \( a \) up to the current index matches a substring of \( b \). If no match is found, it prints the length of \( b \). The function returns nothing but prints the result for each test case.
