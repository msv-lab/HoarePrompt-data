Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to find the next occurrence of the current character of `d` in `e` starting from index `k`, but this approach does not guarantee that the found index will maintain the order of characters in `d`. 

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
2
5 4
10011
1110
3 3
100
110
```

Expected Output:
```
2
2
```

However, the program's output for the first test case is `2`, which is correct. But for the second test case, the program outputs `2` instead of `1`. This is because the program incorrectly updates the index `k` without ensuring that the characters in `d` are processed in the correct order as a subsequence of `e`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the characters in `d` are matched in the exact order they appear in `d` within `e`. A more appropriate approach would be to iterate through `d` and check if each character can be found in `e` in the correct order, updating the index accordingly.
