Output State: **All iterations of the loop have been executed. The value of `b` remains unchanged, `i` has been incremented by the number of times the loop was executed (which is `b`), and `k` is set to `b`.**

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations as specified by the variable `b`. Since `i` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 each time the loop completes, `i` will now be equal to `b`. The variable `k` will be set to `b` after the last iteration, following the logic within the loop. All other variables (`a`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `j`) will retain their values from the last iteration or will not have been modified by the loop.
