Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is the string input from the user.**

The code `d = input()` assigns the string input from the user to the variable `d`. All other variables remain unchanged with their initial states.
