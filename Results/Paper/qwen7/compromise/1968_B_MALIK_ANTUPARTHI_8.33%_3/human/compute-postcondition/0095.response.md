Output State: **`b` must be at least 1, `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer, `i` is `b + 2`, `k` is `j + 1`, `d` is the new value of the input string, `e` is the new input string, `j` is 2, and the character at position `j` in `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`. Additionally, either `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. All the initial conditions and relationships between the variables remain unchanged.
