Output State: **`b` must be at least 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `k` is `j + 2`**.

Explanation: The code `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. Given the initial state where `j` is the next integer in the range `[0, b-1]`, the new value of `k` is `j + 1`. Since `j` was originally `j + 1`, the updated value of `k` becomes `j + 2`. The conditions and values of `b` and the initial increment of `j` remain unchanged.
