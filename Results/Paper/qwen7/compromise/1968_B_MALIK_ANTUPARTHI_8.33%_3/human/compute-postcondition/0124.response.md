To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The variables `b`, `c`, `i`, `k`, `d`, `e`, and `j` retain their final values after the loop has completed all its iterations. This means that the values of these variables are determined by the loop and will be used in the print statement.

2. **Print Statement**: The print statement is `print(k)`. This means that only the value of `k` will be printed.

Since the exact values of `b`, `c`, `i`, `k`, `d`, `e`, and `j` are not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `k`. However, we know that `k` retains its final value after the loop has completed.

Therefore, the output will be the final value of `k` after the loop has finished executing.

Output: **k (where k is the final value of k after the loop has completed)**
