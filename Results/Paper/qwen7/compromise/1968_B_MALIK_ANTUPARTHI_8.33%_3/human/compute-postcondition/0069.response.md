Postcondition: `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer from the input, `i` is `b + 1`, `k` is either `j + 1` or `j` (depending on whether `k == c` or `j == b - 1`), `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, and `j` is `j + 1`. In both cases (whether `d[j]` is in `e[k:]` or not), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
