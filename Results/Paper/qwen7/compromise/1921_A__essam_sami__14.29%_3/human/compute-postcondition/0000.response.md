Output State: **t is the number of test cases entered by the user.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. This value is stored in the variable `t`. All other preconditions remain unchanged, meaning the initial state for each test case (the coordinates of the squares) is yet to be provided.
