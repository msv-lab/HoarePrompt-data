Output State: The output state will consist of a series of numbers printed by the `print` statements inside the loop. For each iteration of the loop, the program calculates two distances `n` and `x`, and prints the smaller one. Therefore, the output will contain `t` numbers, where `t` is the number of test cases, and each number is the minimum distance calculated for each set of inputs provided by the user.
