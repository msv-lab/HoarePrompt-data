Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either \(n\) or \(x\), depending on which value is greater for the corresponding iteration. Specifically, for each test case \(t\), the program calculates two distances \(n\) and \(x\) based on the input values and prints the larger of the two distances.
