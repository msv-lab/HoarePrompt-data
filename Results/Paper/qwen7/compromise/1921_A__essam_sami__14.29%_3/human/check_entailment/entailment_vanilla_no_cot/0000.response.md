Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly identify the corners of the square and calculate its area. The logic used to determine which points form the sides of the square is flawed. Specifically, the program calculates the squared distance between pairs of points and compares them, but this approach does not guarantee that the points forming the sides of the square will be identified correctly.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to identify the pairs of points that form the sides of the square. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Find the distances between all pairs of points
        distances = []
        for i in range(4):
            for j in range(i+1, 4):
                dist = ((points[i][0] - points[j][0]) ** 2 + (points[i][1] - points[j][1]) ** 2)
                distances.append(dist)
        
        # Identify the smallest and second smallest distances
        min_dist = min(distances)
        distances.remove(min_dist)
        second_min_dist = min(distances)
        
        # The area of the square is (second smallest distance) ** 0.5 ** 2
        area = second_min_dist ** 0.5
        print(area ** 2)

func()
```

This program correctly identifies the sides of the square by finding the smallest and second smallest distances among all pairs of points, which correspond to the side length and diagonal of the square, respectively.
