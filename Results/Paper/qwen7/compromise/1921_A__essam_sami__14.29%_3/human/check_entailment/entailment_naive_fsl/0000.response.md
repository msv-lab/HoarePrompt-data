Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The logic used to determine which pair of points to consider as the diagonal of the square is flawed. Specifically, the program only considers one pair of points and does not account for all possible pairs of points that could form the diagonal of the square.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

```
1
0 0
1 1
-1 -1
-2 -2
```

In this case, the correct area of the square should be 2^2 = 4. However, the program will incorrectly compute the distance between (0, 0) and (-1, -1), which is \(\sqrt{2}\), and thus the area will be 2, which is incorrect.

The program needs to check all possible pairs of points to ensure that it identifies the correct diagonal of the square. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        distances = []
        for i in range(4):
            for j in range(i + 1, 4):
                dx = abs(points[i][0] - points[j][0])
                dy = abs(points[i][1] - points[j][1])
                distances.append(dx * dx + dy * dy)
        
        max_distance = max(distances)
        area = int(math.sqrt(max_distance))
        print(area * area)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that all possible pairs of points are checked to find the maximum distance, which corresponds to the diagonal of the square.
