Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners.
- The program calculates the squared Euclidean distances between pairs of points, but it does not correctly identify which points form the diagonally opposite corners of the square.
- The logic in the program compares the distances `n` and `x` without ensuring that these points are indeed diagonally opposite corners of the square.
- The program assumes that the smallest distance is always the correct diagonal length, which is not necessarily true. For example, if the square is oriented at an angle, the calculated distances might not correspond to the diagonals.
- The program should check all possible pairs of points to ensure they form the diagonally opposite corners of the square before calculating the distance.

Given this reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the diagonally opposite corners of the square.

Correctness: **False**
