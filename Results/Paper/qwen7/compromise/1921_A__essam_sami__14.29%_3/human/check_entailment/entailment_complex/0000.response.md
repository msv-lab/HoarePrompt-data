Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the squared Euclidean distance between the diagonally opposite corners of the square and printing the smaller distance. However, this approach is incorrect because the squared Euclidean distance between any two points (corners) does not necessarily represent the side length of the square. Instead, the correct approach would be to calculate the distances between all pairs of points and identify the unique distances, which should be equal for adjacent sides of the square. The smallest unique distance will be the side length of the square, and the area can be calculated as the square of this distance.

The given program does not correctly implement this logic. It only calculates the distances between one pair of diagonally opposite corners and prints the smaller of the two distances, which may not be the side length of the square.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
