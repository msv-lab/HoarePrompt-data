State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is undefined**.

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is defined as an integer input from the user, and it is given that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.
- The loop variable `_` is a special variable used in Python's `for` loop when you don't need to use the index or the value being iterated over. It is automatically initialized to each integer in the range `range(t)` during each iteration of the loop.
- Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, `t` must be within the specified range for the loop to execute.
- The variable `_` is not yet defined because the loop has not started executing, but it will be set to each integer in the range `range(t)` during each iteration.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\).
