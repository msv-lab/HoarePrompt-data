Output State: **`i` is 4, `mak` is 3, a string input has been read and its value is less than the character `<`, and `n` must be greater than 4**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or conditions. It simply flushes the output buffer. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
