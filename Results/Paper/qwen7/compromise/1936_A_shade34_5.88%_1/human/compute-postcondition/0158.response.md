Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `mak + 1`
   - `n` is `n-2`
   - `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `n-1`
   - `str` is `'>'`

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Determine Values:**
   - `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `n-1`. This means if `n` is `k`, then `pans` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., k-1]`.
   - `i` is `mak + 1`. So, `i` is one more than `mak`.
   - `pans[mak]` is the element at index `mak` in the list `pans`. Since `pans` contains integers from `0` to `n-1`, `pans[mak]` is `mak`.
   - `pans[i]` is the element at index `i` in the list `pans`. Since `i` is `mak + 1`, `pans[i]` is `mak + 1`.

4. **Substitute Values into Print Statement:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `pans[mak]`, `pans[mak]`, `pans[i]`, and `pans[i]`.
   - Therefore, it will print: `'?', mak, mak, mak+1, mak+1`

5. **Final Output:**
   - Output: **'? mak mak mak+1 mak+1' (where mak is the value of mak and n is n-2)**

This is the precise description of what will be printed based on the given initial state and the print statement.
