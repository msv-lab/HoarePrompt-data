Output State: **`i` is 3, `mak` is 0**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `mak`, or `n`. It only flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which is an operation related to I/O and does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the values of `i` and `mak` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
