Output State: **`i` is less than `n` and at least 1, `n` is an input integer, no new variables are introduced or modified, `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not modify any variables or introduce new ones. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. The conditions and values of the existing variables remain unchanged.
