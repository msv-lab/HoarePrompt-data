Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1, 2, or 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - If `s` is '<', `pans` is a list containing `[i]` and `mak` is equal to `i`.
   - Otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged and `s` is the new input string from the user.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be either 1, 2, or 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2, 3, or 4 (depending on its value at the end of the previous iteration).
   - `n` must remain greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

5. **Consider the effect of the loop body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know that `s` is checked and `pans` and `mak` might be updated based on the value of `s`.

6. **Final state adjustments**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be 2, 3, or 4.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3.
   - `s` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `pans` and `mak` will depend on the value of `s` at the end of the previous iteration:
     - If `s` was '<' at the end of the previous iteration, `pans` will contain `[i-1]` and `mak` will be `i-1`.
     - Otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged, and `s` is the new input string from the user.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is 2, 3, or 4; `n` must be greater than 3; `s` is the same as at the end of the previous iteration; if `s` is '<', `pans` contains `[i-1]` and `mak` is equal to `i-1`; otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged and `s` is the new input string from the user.**
