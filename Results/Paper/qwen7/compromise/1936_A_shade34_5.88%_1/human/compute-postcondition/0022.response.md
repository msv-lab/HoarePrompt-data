Output State: **mak is 3, i is 3, n must be greater than 3, and the input string is not '<' for any iteration from 2 to n-1.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `mak` will be 3, `i` will be 3, and `n` must be greater than 3. Additionally, for each iteration from 2 to `n-1`, the input received was not the string '<', which means `mak` did not get updated beyond its value of 3.
