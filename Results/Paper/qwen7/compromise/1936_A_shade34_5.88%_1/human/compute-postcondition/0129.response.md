Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`; `mak` is `i`; `n` must be greater than `n-1`; `mak2` is `n-1`; `pans` is a list containing the element `k + 1`; the new string `s` is equal to the input received from the user.**

Explanation: The line `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is `k + 1`) to the variable `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
