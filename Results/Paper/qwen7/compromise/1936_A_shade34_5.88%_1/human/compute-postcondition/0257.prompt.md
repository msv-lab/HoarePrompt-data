Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the provided function signature. However, the problem requires interacting with a hidden permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \), which is a permutation of \(\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}\). You can ask up to \(3n\) queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation. After determining the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\), you must print "! i j".
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '<':
            mak = i
    mak2 = mak
    pans = []
    for i in range(n):
        print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        s = str(input())
        if s == '<':
            mak = i
            pans = [i]
        elif s == '=':
            pans.append(i)
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, len(pans)):
        print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '>':
            mak = i
    print('!', mak2, mak)
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 3, `mak` is 3

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop will continue until `i` equals the length of `pans`. At that point, the final state will be: `i` is equal to the length of `pans`, `n` is 0 (since it decreases by 1 each iteration and starts as `len(pans) - 1`), `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `len(pans) - 1`, and `mak` is equal to `i - 1`. `sys.stdout.flush()` is called.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(pans)`, `mak` will be equal to `len(pans) - 1`, and the input has been read `n` times. `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
