Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `n`, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is an empty list, a string input has been read and its value is less than the character '<', and `n` must be greater than `n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing the element `i`, and the new string `s` is either equal to '<' or '='.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `k + 1`; `n` must be greater than `n-1`; `mak` and `mak2` are both `n-1`; `pans` is a list containing the elements `k + 1` and `i`; the new string `s` is equal to the input received from the user. If the string `s` equals `<`, then `i` becomes `k + 1`; `mak` becomes `i`; and `pans` includes `i` (which is `k + 1`). If the string `s` equals `=`, then `i` remains `k + 1`; `n` remains greater than `n-1`; `mak` and `mak2` remain `n-1`; `pans` includes `k + 1` and `i`; and `s` remains the input received from the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `k + 2`, `n` must be greater than `k`, `s` is a string input by the user, and `pans` is a list containing the value `i`. If `s` equals `'<'`, `pans` is updated to a list containing `[i]`; if `s` equals `'='`, `pans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
