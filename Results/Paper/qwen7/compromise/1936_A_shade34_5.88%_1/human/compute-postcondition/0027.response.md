Output State: **`i` is 0, 1, or 2 (depending on the value of `n`), `n` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. Since no variables are modified or their values changed by this line of code, the initial state remains unchanged.
