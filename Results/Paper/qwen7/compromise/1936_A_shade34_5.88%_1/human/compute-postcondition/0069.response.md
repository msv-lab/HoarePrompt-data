Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2
- `mak` is 1

We need to determine the values of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the contents of the `pans` list. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`.

Given this information, the output will include placeholders for these unknown values.

Output: **'? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]]'**
