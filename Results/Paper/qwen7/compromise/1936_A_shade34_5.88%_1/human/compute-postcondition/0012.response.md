Output State: **`mak` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, and the input is a string equal to '<'. The sys.stdout.flush() function has been called.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call does not change the values of the variables `mak`, `i`, `n`, or the input string. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the console immediately. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
