Output State: **`i` is 3, `mak` is 3**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all pending output is written to the console. This operation does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i` and `mak` remain unchanged at 3. The output state remains the same as the initial state provided, with `i` being 3 and `mak` being 3.
