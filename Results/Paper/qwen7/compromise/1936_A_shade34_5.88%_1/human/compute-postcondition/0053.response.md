Output State: **`i` is 2, 3, or 4; `n` must be greater than 3; `s` is a string input by the user; `mak` is equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `mak`. Since `i` can be 2, 3, or 4, `mak` will also be 2, 3, or 4 respectively. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
