Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head defines the variables that are relevant to the loop condition. In this case, the loop head includes `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak` is 2
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - The input is a string equal to '<'

4. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Currently, `i` is 2. To satisfy the condition `i < n`, `n` must be greater than 2 (which it already is).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from 2 to 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 2.

6. **Final state**:
   - `mak` remains 2.
   - `i` becomes 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`mak` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2**
