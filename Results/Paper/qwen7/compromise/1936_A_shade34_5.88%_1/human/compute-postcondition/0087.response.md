Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 3.
   - `mak` is initially set to 0 (though this variable is not used in the loop head).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` is set to 3, it does not affect the loop's execution condition directly. However, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `mak` is irrelevant to the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n`, ensuring that it is greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `mak` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
