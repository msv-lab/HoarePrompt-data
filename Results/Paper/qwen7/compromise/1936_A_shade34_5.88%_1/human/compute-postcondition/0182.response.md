Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We know that at the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is less than `n` and at least 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will iterate over values of `i` starting from 1 up to `n-1`.

3. **Key Points to Consider**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop will stop when `i` reaches `n`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is less than `n` and at least 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so it becomes `i + 1`).
   - After incrementing `i`, the new value of `i` should still be less than `n`.

5. **Final State**:
   - Since `i` was less than `n` and at least 1, after incrementing `i` by 1, `i` will now be `i + 1`.
   - This new value of `i` must still be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed**.

Given that `i` was less than `n` and at least 1, after incrementing `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will still be less than `n`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed**.
