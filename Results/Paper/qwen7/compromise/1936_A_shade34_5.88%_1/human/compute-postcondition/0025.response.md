Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 because `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 3, it will indeed generate at least one iteration (from 0 to 2).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `i` is already set to 3, but within the loop, `i` will start from 0 up to `n-1`. Therefore, `i` will be 0, 1, or 2 depending on the value of `n`.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 3 to ensure the loop runs at least once.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `mak` and `mak2` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.
   - `pans` is an empty list and does not affect the loop's execution condition.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, 1, or 2 (depending on the value of `n`), `n` must be greater than 3**
