Postcondition: **`pans` is a list. If `s` is the string "<", then `pans` is `[i]`, `i` is less than `n`, `mak` is equal to `i`, `mak2` is equal to `n-1`, and `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed `n-1` times. If `s` is the string "=", then `pans` is a list containing the element `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `mak` is equal to `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to `n-1`, and `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed `n-1` times.**
