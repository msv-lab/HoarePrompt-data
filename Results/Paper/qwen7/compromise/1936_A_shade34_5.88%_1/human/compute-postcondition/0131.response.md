Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`; `n` must be greater than `n-1`; `mak` is `n-1`; `mak2` is `n-1`; `pans` is a list containing the elements `k + 1` and `i`; the new string `s` is equal to the input received from the user.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Since `i` is `k + 1`, the list `pans` now contains two elements: `k + 1` and `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
