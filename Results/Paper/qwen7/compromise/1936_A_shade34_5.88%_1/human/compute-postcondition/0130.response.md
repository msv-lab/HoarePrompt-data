Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`; `mak` is `i`; `n` must be greater than `n-1`; `mak2` is `n-1`; `pans` is a list containing the elements `i` (which is `k + 1`); the new string `s` is equal to the input received from the user.**

Explanation: The code `pans = [i]` updates the list `pans` to contain the single element `i`, which is `k + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
