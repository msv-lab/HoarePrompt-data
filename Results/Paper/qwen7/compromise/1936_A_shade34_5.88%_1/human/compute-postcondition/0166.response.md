Output State: **`i` is `mak + 2`, `n` is `n - 2` and must be greater than or equal to `mak + 3`, `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `n - 1`, and `mak` is now equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` simply assigns the current value of `i` to `mak`. Since the initial state of `i` is `mak + 2`, `mak` is now also `mak + 2`. The values of `n`, `pans`, and the condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `mak + 3` remain unchanged.
