Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `pans` is a list, but its contents are not specified.
   - `i` is less than `n` and equal to `i + 1`. This implies that `i` must be `n - 1` because if `i` were any other value, `i + 1` would not be equal to `i`.
   - `mak` is equal to `i` or `n-1`. Since `i` is `n - 1`, `mak` must also be `n - 1`.
   - `mak2` is equal to `n - 1`.
   - `s` is an input string, but its specific value is not relevant to the print statement.
   - `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed `n + 1` times, but this does not affect the print statement directly.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)`.
   - Substituting the known values from the initial state:
     - `mak` is `n - 1`.
     - `mak2` is `n - 1`.
     - `i` is `n - 1`.

So, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` (a question mark).
- `mak`, which is `n - 1`.
- `mak2`, which is `n - 1`.
- `i`, which is `n - 1`.
- `mak2`, which is `n - 1` again.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? n-1 n-1 n-1 n-1'**
