Postcondition: `i` is less than `n` and at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed. If the input string is less than the character '<', then `i` remains unchanged and `n` remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, no additional changes occur if the input string is not less than the character '<'.
