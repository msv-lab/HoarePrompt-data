Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `n`. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed data is displayed immediately. Since no assignment or modification to `i` or `n` is performed, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
