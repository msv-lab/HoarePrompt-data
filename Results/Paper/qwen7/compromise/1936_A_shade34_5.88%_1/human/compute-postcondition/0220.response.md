Postcondition: **`pans` is a list, `i` is less than `n`, `mak` is equal to `i` or `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to `n-1`, `s` is the input string, and `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed `n` times. If `s` equals `<`, then `pans` becomes `[i]`. If `s` equals `=`, then no change occurs in the variables.**
