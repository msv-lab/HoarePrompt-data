Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `len(pans)`
   - `mak` is equal to `i`
   - The input equals '>'
   - The input has been read (implied by the postcondition)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be one more than its value at the start of the current iteration.
   - Therefore, if `i` was less than `len(pans)` at the start of the current iteration, it will now be equal to `len(pans)` or one less than `len(pans)` depending on the exact value of `i` at the start of the current iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(pans)` at the start of the next iteration. This means `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was `k` at the start of the current iteration, it will be `k+1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `mak` will be updated to the new value of `i`.
   - The input remains '>', and the fact that the input has been read still holds.

Given that `i` was less than `len(pans)` at the start of the current iteration, let's denote the value of `i` at the start of the current iteration as `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k+1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is less than `len(pans)`, `mak` is equal to `i+1`, and the input equals '>'**
