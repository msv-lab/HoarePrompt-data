Output State: **`i` is `mak`, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing `i`, `s` is a string equal to '<'**.

Explanation: The code snippet `pans = [i]` updates the list `pans` to contain the single element `i`. Since `i` was previously assigned the value of `mak`, `pans` now contains `mak`. The other variables (`mak`, `mak2`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
