Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `pans`, `mak` is equal to `len(pans) - 1`, `n` is 0 (as it decreases by 1 each iteration and starts as `len(pans) - 1`), `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `len(pans) - 1`, and `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed.

After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `pans`, which is `n` (since `pans` contains all integers from `0` to `n-1`). `mak` will be equal to `len(pans) - 1`, which is `n - 1`. The variable `n` will be 0 because it starts as `len(pans) - 1` and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. `pans` will contain all integers from `0` to `n-1`, which is `0` to `n-1` or simply `0` to `len(pans) - 1`. Finally, `sys.stdout.flush()` is called to ensure the output is sent to the standard output.
