Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, len(pans)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`. 

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is 2.
   - `mak` is 2 (if the input string is '>', otherwise no change).

4. **Next Iteration Calculation**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(pans)`. Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `mak` remains unchanged unless the input string is '>', but since no new information about the input string is given, `mak` stays at 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `mak` is 2**
