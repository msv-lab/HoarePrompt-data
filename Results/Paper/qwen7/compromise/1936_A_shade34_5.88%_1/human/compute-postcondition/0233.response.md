Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `len(pans)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n`.
   - `len(pans)` is the length of the list `pans`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop `for i in range(1, len(pans)):` will execute as long as `i` is in the range from `1` to `len(pans) - 1`.

4. **Analyze the initial state**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be within the range `1` to `len(pans) - 1`.
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n`, `i` must be less than `len(pans)` for the loop to start.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is within the required range for the loop to start. Given that `i` is initially `n`, `n` must be less than `len(pans)`.
   - The other variables (`pans`, `mak`, `mak2`, and the number of times `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed) do not directly affect the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` should be less than `len(pans)`.

State: **`i` is less than `len(pans)`, `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `n-1`, `mak` is equal to `0`, `mak2` is equal to `n-1`, and `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed `n` times.**

However, since we specifically need to focus on the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, the relevant adjustment is:

State: **`i` is less than `len(pans)`**
