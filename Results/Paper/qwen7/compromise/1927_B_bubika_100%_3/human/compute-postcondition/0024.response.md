Output State: **`t` is 1, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `s`. The values of `t` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
