Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s:`. The objects involved here are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `s` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers.
   - `i` will take each value from the list `s` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, the list `s` must contain at least one element. If `s` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop depends on the list `s`, we need to ensure that `s` contains at least one element before the loop starts.

Given the initial state:
- `b` is a list of 26 zeros.
- `t` is 2.
- `r` is an empty string.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers.

We only need to focus on adjusting the state of `s` because it is the only object in the loop head that affects the loop's execution.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
**`s` must contain at least one element.**

Final Answer:
State: **`s` must contain at least one element**
