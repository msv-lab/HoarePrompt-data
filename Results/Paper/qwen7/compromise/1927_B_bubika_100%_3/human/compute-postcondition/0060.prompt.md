Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n; a is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    b = [0] * 26
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `r` will be a concatenated string formed by adding elements from `a` based on the indices found in `b` for each character in `s`. The list `b` will have each count of characters in `s` incremented by the number of times that character appeared in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `r` is the concatenation of `a[x]` for each character `i` in the string `s`, `t` is still 1, `b` is a list where each count of characters in `s` is incremented by 1, and `r` is an empty string if `s` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations, `r` will be the sum of `a[x]` for each `i` in `s`, `b[x]` for each `i` in `s` will be incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `s`, and `s` will be an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
