Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `b` is a list of 26 zeros; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` and `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `b` is still a list of 26 zeros.
