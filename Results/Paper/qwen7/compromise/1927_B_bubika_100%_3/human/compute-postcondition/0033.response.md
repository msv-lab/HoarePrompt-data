Output State: **`r` is the new value of `a[x]` added to its previous value, `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the string `b`, and `b[x]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b[x] += 1` increments the value of `b[x]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
