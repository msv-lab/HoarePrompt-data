The function accepts three parameters: a positive integer \( n \), and two strings \( s1 \) and \( s2 \) of length \( n \) consisting of '0' and '1'. It calculates and returns the maximum value between the count of positions where \( s1[i] \) is '0' and \( s2[i] \) is '1', and the count of positions where \( s1[i] \) is '1' and \( s2[i] \) is '0', for all \( i \) in the range of \( n \).
