Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `s`, `ac` is 1 if `i` is 'A', and 0 otherwise, `bc` is 2 if `i` is not 'A', and 1 if `i` is 'A'**.

Explanation: The value of `bc` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 'A', then `bc` was initially 1 and now it is 2. If `i` is not 'A', then `bc` was initially 0 and now it is 1. The other variables (`s`, `i`, `ac`) remain unchanged.
