Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `s` is a non-empty string.
  - `ac` is 1 if `i` is 'A', and 0 otherwise.
  - `bc` is 1 if `i` is not 'A', and 0 otherwise.

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for i in s:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`.
   - The loop head does not explicitly define any additional variables other than `i`.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s`.
   - After the previous iteration, `s` is still a non-empty string.

3. **Modifying States:**
   - Since `i` is being iterated over from `s`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next character in `s`.
   - The values of `ac` and `bc` will depend on the current character `i`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Character `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last character processed in `s`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be the next character in `s`.

2. **Counters `ac` and `bc`:**
   - `ac` is 1 if `i` is 'A' and 0 otherwise.
   - `bc` is 1 if `i` is not 'A' and 0 otherwise.
   - These counters will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

### New State:
- `s` remains a non-empty string (since it still has characters left).
- `i` will be the next character in `s`.
- `ac` will be 1 if `i` is 'A', and 0 otherwise.
- `bc` will be 1 if `i` is not 'A', and 0 otherwise.

### Final Answer:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `s`, `ac` is 1 if `i` is 'A', and 0 otherwise, and `bc` is 1 if `i` is not 'A', and 0 otherwise.**

This can be written more formally as:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `s`, `ac` is 1 if `i` is 'A', and 0 otherwise, and `bc` is 1 if `i` is not 'A', and 0 otherwise.**
