Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ac` is 2, and `bc` remains 1 if the previous `i` was not 'A', otherwise `bc` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ac += 1` increments the value of `ac` by 1. Since `ac` was initially 1 (if the previous `i` was 'A'), it becomes 2. The value of `bc` remains unchanged unless the condition for setting it to 1 (if the previous `i` was not 'A') changes, which is not specified in the given code snippet.
