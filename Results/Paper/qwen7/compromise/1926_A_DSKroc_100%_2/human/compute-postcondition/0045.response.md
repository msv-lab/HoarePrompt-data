Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is the next character in `s`.
   - `ac` is 2 if `i` is 'A', and 1 otherwise.
   - `bc` is 2 if `i` is not 'A', and 1 if `i` is 'A'.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, `i` will move to the next character in `s` for the next iteration.
   - `s` itself does not change within the loop; it remains the same string.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `s` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `i` moves to the next character in `s`.

5. **Determine the new value of `ac` and `bc`**:
   - `ac` will be 2 if the next character `i` is 'A', and 1 otherwise.
   - `bc` will be 2 if the next character `i` is not 'A', and 1 if the next character `i` is 'A'.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `s` is a non-empty string (unchanged).
- `i` is the next character in `s` (moved to the next character).
- `ac` is 2 if the next character `i` is 'A', and 1 otherwise.
- `bc` is 2 if the next character `i` is not 'A', and 1 if the next character `i` is 'A'.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `s`, `ac` is 2 if `i` is 'A', and 1 otherwise, and `bc` is 2 if `i` is not 'A', and 1 if `i` is 'A'**.
