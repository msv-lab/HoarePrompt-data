State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, q is 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `q` starts at 0, as specified by `range(t)`.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`. Given that `t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, this ensures the loop can run.
- No other variables or states need adjustment since they are not part of the loop head.
