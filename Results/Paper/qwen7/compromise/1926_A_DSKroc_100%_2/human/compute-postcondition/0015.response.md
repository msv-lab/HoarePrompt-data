Output State: **`ac` and `bc` are either both 1 or both 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `q` is 0, `s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the second character of the string `s`, `bc` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `bc += 1` increments the value of `bc` by 1. Since `bc` was initially either 1 or 0, after the increment, `bc` will now be 2 if it was initially 1, or 1 if it was initially 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
