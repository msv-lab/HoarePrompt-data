Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string, `ac` is the total count of 'A' characters in `s`, and `bc` is the total count of characters in `s` that are not 'A'. The postcondition states that either `ac > bc` is true, in which case no changes are made, or `ac <= bc`, in which case no changes are made as well. Therefore, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
