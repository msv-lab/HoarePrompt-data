Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine which character ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in a given string of length 5 for each test case. The program iterates through each character of the string, counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', and then prints the more frequent character. Given the constraints and the example provided, the program works as expected and handles all specified cases correctly.
