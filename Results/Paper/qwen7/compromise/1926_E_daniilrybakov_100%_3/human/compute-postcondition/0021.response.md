Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `s` is incremented by `x`.**

Explanation: The code `m *= 2` doubles the value of `m`. Since `m` was initially 2, after executing the code, `m` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
