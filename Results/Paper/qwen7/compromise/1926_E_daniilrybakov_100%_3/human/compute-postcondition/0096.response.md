Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `t` is 5.
   - `m` is 60.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `s` is 13.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop condition is `n != 0`.
   - `n` is initially 0, but if we consider the loop's behavior, we need to understand how `n` changes.
   - Since `n` is 0, let's assume the loop is not running due to the initial state. However, the problem states that `m` is updated every two iterations, and `s` accumulates a value of 8 by the third iteration, making `s` equal to 13 by the fourth iteration.

3. **Variable Values Before Print Statement:**
   - `k` is an input integer, but its value is not specified. Let's denote it as `k`.
   - `s` is 13.
   - `m` is 60.

4. **Expression Evaluation:**
   - The expression to evaluate is `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.
   - Substitute the known values: `s` is 13 and `m` is 60.
   - The expression becomes: `(2 * (k - 13) - 1) * 60`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The expression simplifies to: `(2 * k - 26 - 1) * 60 = (2 * k - 27) * 60`.

Given the values and the expression, the output will be:

Output: **(2 * k - 27) * 60**
