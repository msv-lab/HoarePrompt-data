Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The value of `m` is multiplied by 2, so `m` changes from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state and the code snippet provided.
