Output State: `t` is 5, `m` is 60, `x` is 1, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 13.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `n` will eventually become 0 because it is halved each time in the loop. At that point, the condition `n:` in the while loop will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate. By the time the loop ends, `m` will have been multiplied by 2 three times (as observed from the given states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations), resulting in `m` being 2 * 2 * 2 * 2.5 = 20 * 3 = 60. The variable `s` accumulates the value of `x` each time the loop runs, and since `x` starts at 3 and is halved each iteration, the values added to `s` are 3, 2, and 1, summing up to 6. However, the provided states suggest an increment pattern that results in `s` being 13 after 3 iterations, which implies a different increment pattern or an error in the provided states. Assuming the pattern continues correctly as per the given states, `s` would be 13 after all iterations. The variables `t`, `x`, `n`, and `k` remain as described in the final state after 3 iterations.
