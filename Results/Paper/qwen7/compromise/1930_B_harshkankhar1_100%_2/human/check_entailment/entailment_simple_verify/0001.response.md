### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Permutation Generation**:
   - Inside `func_1`, a list `a` is created containing integers from 1 to `n`. This is correct.
   - The list `a` is then modified so that every other element starting from the first element is reversed. This means the odd-indexed elements are in descending order, and the even-indexed elements are in ascending order.
   - The resulting permutation is printed.

3. **Validation**:
   - Let's consider the structure of the permutation generated by the program:
     - For odd indices: `a[0], a[2], a[4], ...` are in descending order.
     - For even indices: `a[1], a[3], a[5], ...` are in ascending order.
   - We need to check if there exist two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) (with \(i \neq j\)) such that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\).
   - Consider the following cases:
     - If \(i\) is odd and \(j\) is even:
       - Since the odd-indexed elements are in descending order and the even-indexed elements are in ascending order, it is impossible for \(p_i\) to divide \(p_j\) because \(p_i > p_j\).
       - Similarly, \(p_{i+1}\) (which is even) cannot divide \(p_{j+1}\) (which is odd) due to the different orders.
     - If both \(i\) and \(j\) are either odd or even:
       - If both are odd, they are in descending order, and no division relationship can hold because they are strictly decreasing.
       - If both are even, they are in ascending order, and no division relationship can hold because they are strictly increasing.
   - Therefore, the generated permutation satisfies the condition that no such pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) exists.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the generated permutation, which is correct.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly generates a permutation that meets the problem's requirements. The original assessment is accurate.
