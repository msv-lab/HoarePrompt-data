Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program generates a permutation of length \( n \) by creating a list of integers from 1 to \( n \) and reversing every other element. This approach ensures that no two elements \( p_i \) and \( p_{i+1} \) exist such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_{i+1} \) and vice versa, as the sequence alternates between increasing and decreasing values around the midpoint. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this method guarantees that the generated permutation meets the required conditions for all valid inputs within the specified range. Therefore, the program is correct.
