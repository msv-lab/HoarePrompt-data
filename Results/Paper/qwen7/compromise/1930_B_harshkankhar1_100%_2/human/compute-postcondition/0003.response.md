Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where for each case, a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) are given. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each test case, the function determines whether the conditions for `t` and `n` are met and returns appropriate outputs based on these conditions.**

This means the function iterates over multiple test cases, each containing a `t` and an `n`, and checks if they fall within the specified ranges. However, since the function signature does not include any parameters, the description focuses on the expected inputs and the processing logic without detailing the implementation.
