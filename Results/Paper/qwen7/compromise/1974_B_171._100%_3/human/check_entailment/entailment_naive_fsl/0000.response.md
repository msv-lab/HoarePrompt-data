Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program works for all potential cases:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads multiple test cases efficiently using `sys.stdin.read` and processes them one by one.
2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - It first extracts the unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically to form the auxiliary string `r`.
   - It creates a mapping from each character in `r` to its corresponding symmetric character.
   - It uses this mapping to decode the encoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its symmetric counterpart from `r`.

Given the nature of the problem and the provided code, there doesn't seem to be any edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the program to fail. The logic is straightforward and correctly implements the described decoding process. Therefore, the program is correct.
