Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program and the execution summary:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates through the input, processing each test case one by one.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it extracts the length `n` of the encoded string `b`.
   - It then processes the encoded string `b` to decode it.
3. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program first finds all unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sorts them alphabetically.
   - It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted list of unique characters is mapped to its corresponding character from the end of the list.
   - Finally, it decodes the encoded string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

Given the execution summary, the program correctly maps each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character based on the reverse order of the sorted unique characters. This matches the problem's requirement for decoding.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
