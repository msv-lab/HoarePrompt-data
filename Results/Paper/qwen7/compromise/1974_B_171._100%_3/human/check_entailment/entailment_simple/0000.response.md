Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
2. The `func_1` function is responsible for decoding the encoded string.
3. The function first creates a list of unique characters from the encoded string, sorted alphabetically.
4. It then creates a mapping (`char_map`) where each character in the sorted unique list is mapped to its corresponding character in reverse order.
5. Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the encoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.

Given the problem description and the steps taken by the function, the logic appears to be sound and should produce the correct decoded string for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
