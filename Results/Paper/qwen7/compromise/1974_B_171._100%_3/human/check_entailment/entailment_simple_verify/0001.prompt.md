You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s using the specified algorithm.

    #State: Output State: `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded`, sorted alphabetically, and `char_map` is a dictionary where each key-value pair is reversed compared to its original position in `unique_chars`. Specifically, the first character in `unique_chars` maps to the last character, the second character maps to the second last character, and so on.

    #The program returns a string `decoded` which is obtained by mapping each character in `encoded` using the `char_map` dictionary, where the keys and values of `char_map` are reversed compared to their original positions in the sorted list `unique_chars`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded strings according to the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into parts.
   - It then iterates through the test cases one by one.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the encoded string `b`.
   - It then reads the encoded string `b`.

3. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to decode the string.
   - It first extracts the unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - It creates a mapping where each character in the sorted unique characters is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character.
   - Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the entire encoded string.

### Verification of Decoding Logic

1. **Extracting Unique Characters**:
   - The unique characters are extracted correctly using `set(encoded)` and sorted alphabetically.

2. **Creating the Mapping**:
   - The mapping is created such that each character is paired with its symmetric counterpart. This is done correctly by iterating over the sorted unique characters and mapping each character to its symmetric counterpart.

3. **Decoding the String**:
   - The decoded string is generated by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding symmetric character using the mapping.

### Testing the Example Cases

Let's manually verify the decoding process for one of the example cases:

#### Example Case:
- **Encoded String**: `serofedsoc`
- **Unique Characters**: `cdefors`
- **Mapping**:
  - `c` -> `s`
  - `d` -> `r`
  - `e` -> `e`
  - `f` -> `d`
  - `o` -> `o`
  - `r` -> `c`

Using the mapping, we can decode the string:
- `s` -> `c`
- `e` -> `e`
- `r` -> `c`
- `o` -> `o`
- `f` -> `d`
- `e` -> `e`
- `d` -> `r`
- `s` -> `c`
- `o` -> `o`
- `c` -> `s`

This results in the original string `codeforces`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.
