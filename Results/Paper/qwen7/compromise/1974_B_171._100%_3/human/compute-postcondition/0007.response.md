Output State: **The program returns a string `decoded` which is obtained by mapping each character in `encoded` using the `char_map` dictionary, where the keys and values of `char_map` are reversed compared to their original positions in the sorted list `unique_chars`.**

This means that the program returns the decoded string, which is created by replacing each character in the `encoded` string with its corresponding character from the `char_map` dictionary. The `char_map` dictionary has been constructed such that for each key-value pair in the original mapping, the keys and values are swapped. The `unique_chars` list contains unique characters from the `encoded` string, sorted alphabetically.
