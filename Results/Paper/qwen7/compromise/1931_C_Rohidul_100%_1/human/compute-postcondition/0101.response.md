Output State: **`le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` and continue to be equal to subsequent elements until `le-1`, `l` is equal to `r-1`, `st` is `n`, `r` is equal to `l+1`, `end` is `le-1`, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by calculating `max(0, le - (st + end))`. Given the initial conditions, `st` is `n` and `end` is `le-1`. Therefore, `ans` is calculated as `max(0, le - (n + le - 1))`, which simplifies to `max(0, 2*le - n - 1)`. Since `le` is the length of the list `a` and `n` is greater than 1, the value of `ans` will be `2*le - n - 1` if it is positive, otherwise 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
