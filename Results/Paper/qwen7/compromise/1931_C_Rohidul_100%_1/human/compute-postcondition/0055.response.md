To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current values of the relevant variables.

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
```

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true:
1. `r > l`
2. `a[r] == a[r - 1]`

### Current States
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is equal to `r` + 1.
- `r` is now `n - 2`.
- `end` is 3.
- `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
- `le` is the length of list `a`.
- `st` is the last incremented value of `st` inside the loop.
- `end` is increased by 1.

### Adjusting the States
1. **Condition `r > l`:**
   - Given `l = r + 1`, the condition `r > l` simplifies to `r > r + 1`, which is always false. Therefore, this condition cannot be satisfied, and the loop will not execute again based on the current values of `l` and `r`.

2. **Condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]`:**
   - This condition depends on the values of `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]`. Since we don't have specific values for these elements, we cannot directly adjust this condition. However, we know that the loop body is omitted, meaning the loop continues as long as `a[r] == a[r - 1]` holds true.

Since the first condition `r > l` is always false, the loop will not execute again regardless of the values of `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]`.

### Conclusion
Given that the loop condition `r > l` is always false, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is equal to `r` + 1, `r` is now `n - 2`, `end` is 3, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is the last incremented value of `st` inside the loop, and `end` is increased by 1.**
