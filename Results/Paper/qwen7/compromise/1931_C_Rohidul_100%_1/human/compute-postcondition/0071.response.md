Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is `r + 1` where `r` is `n - k - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers, `le` is the length of the new list `a`, `st` is the last incremented value of `st` from the previous iteration, and `ans` is either updated to `max(0, le - ((n - k - 1) + (2k + 1)))` or remains unchanged based on the first and last elements of the new list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the next input integer provided by the user to the variable `n`. The other variables (`l`, `a`, `le`, `st`, and `ans`) remain unaffected by this operation. The relationships and conditions involving these variables stay the same as per the initial state.
