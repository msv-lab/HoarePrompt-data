Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is 1, `r` is n - 1, `end` is 2, `ans` is max(0, le - (st + end)), `a` is a list of integers obtained from input such that `a[0] == a[1]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is 2, `end` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `st += 1` increments the value of `st` by 1. Initially, `st` was set to 1. After executing the code, `st` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
