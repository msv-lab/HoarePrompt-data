Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `le` is the length of list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`**.

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `l` and `r`. `l` is set to 0, and `r` is set to `n - 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `le` remain unchanged from their initial state.
