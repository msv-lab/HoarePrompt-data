Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `r` is one less than `l`, meaning `r = l - 1`, `end` is equal to `l + 1`, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `n`. The initial conditions for `r`, `end`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, `r` is still one less than `l`, `end` is still equal to `l + 1`, and `ans` is still `max(0, le - (st + end))`. The only new information is that `n` now holds the value of the input integer.
