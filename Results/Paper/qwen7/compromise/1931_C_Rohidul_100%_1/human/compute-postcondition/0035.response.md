Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop variable `_` is being incremented each time the loop runs.

2. **Determine the postconditions at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `r` is one less than `l`, so `r = l - 1`.
   - `end` is equal to `l + 1`.
   - `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop will run based on the input value provided by `int(input())`.
   - Each iteration of the loop will increment the loop variable `_`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop variable `_` is not explicitly used within the loop, it does not affect the values of `r`, `end`, or `ans` directly.
   - However, the loop will continue as long as the input value is positive.

Given that the loop is controlled by the input value, and no other variables are modified within the loop body (as indicated by the omission), the only thing that changes is the number of iterations left to be performed.

Since the loop is controlled by the input value, and we don't know the exact input value, we can only state that the loop will continue as long as the input value is greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- The input value must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

However, since the specific values of `r`, `end`, and `ans` do not change within the loop, they remain the same.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`r` is one less than `l`, meaning `r = l - 1`; `end` is equal to `l + 1`; `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`; the input value must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.**
