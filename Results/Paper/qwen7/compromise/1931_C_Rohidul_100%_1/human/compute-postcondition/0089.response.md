Output State: **`le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` and continue to be equal to subsequent elements until `l` reaches `r-1`, `l` is equal to `r-1`, `st` is `n`, `r` is now `r-1`, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `end` is increased by 1.**

This means that the `end` variable, which was previously at its initial state, has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous conditions and values as described in the initial state.
