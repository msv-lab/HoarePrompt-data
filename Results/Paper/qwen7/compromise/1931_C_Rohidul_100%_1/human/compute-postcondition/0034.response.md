Based on the initial state provided:

- `r` is one less than `l`, so `r = l - 1`.
- `end` is equal to `l + 1`.
- `ans` is calculated as `max(0, le - (st + end))`.

However, there are no explicit values given for `le` and `st`. Since these values are not provided, we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, the expression `le - (st + end)` will remain in its symbolic form.

Given this, the value of `ans` will be determined by the maximum of 0 and the result of `le - (st + end)`. If `le - (st + end)` is positive, `ans` will be that value; otherwise, it will be 0.

Output: **max(0, le - (st + end))**
