Output State: **`r` is greater than `l`, and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 2]`**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given the initial condition that `r` is greater than `l` and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, after decrementing `r`, the new condition for `a[r]` would be equal to `a[r - 2]` because `r` is now one less than its original value.
