Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4, `n` is reduced to the highest power of 2 less than or equal to the original value of `n`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during each iteration of the loop, `m` is 2 raised to the number of iterations the loop executed, `x` is (n + 1) // 2, and `s` is increased by `x` after each iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains within the given range, `n` becomes the largest power of 2 less than or equal to the original `n`, `k` remains unchanged, `s` is the cumulative sum of `x` from each iteration, `m` is 2 to the power of the number of iterations, and `x` is the value calculated in the last iteration of the loop.
