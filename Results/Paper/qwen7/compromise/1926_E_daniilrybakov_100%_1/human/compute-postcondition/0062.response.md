Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` is `n // 2`, `k` is the input integer, `s` is increased by `x`, `m` is 8, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `s` is increased by `x`.**

Explanation: The code `m *= 2` doubles the value of `m`. Since `m` was initially 4, after executing this line, `m` becomes 8. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
