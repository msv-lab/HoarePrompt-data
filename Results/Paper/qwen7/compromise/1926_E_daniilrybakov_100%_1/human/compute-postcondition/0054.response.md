Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` is `n // 2`, `k` is the input integer, `s` is increased by `x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `s` is increased by `x`.**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `m` is 2.
- The code `m *= 2` multiplies the current value of `m` by 2, resulting in `m` being updated to 4.
- No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `x`, and the fact that `s` is increased by `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
