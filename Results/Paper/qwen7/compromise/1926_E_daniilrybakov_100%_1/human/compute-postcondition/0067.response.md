Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is \(2^t\), `x` is 1, `s` is \(s + 1**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `t`, `m`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
