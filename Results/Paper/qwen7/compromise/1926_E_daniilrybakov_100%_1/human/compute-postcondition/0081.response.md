Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 2, `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\), and `s` is \((n + 1) // 2\)**.

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the result back to `n`. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `m`, `x`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `n` is `n // 2`, which means it is now half of its original value. All other conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.
