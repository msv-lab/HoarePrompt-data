Output State: **`n` is now `n // 2`, `x` is (`n + 1`) // 2, `s` is `s + x`.**

Explanation: The code `s += x` increments `s` by the value of `x`. Given the initial conditions, `n` is `n // 2` and `x` is (`n + 1`) // 2. Since `s += x` does not affect the values of `n` and `x`, their values remain unchanged. The only change is that `s` is incremented by `x`.
