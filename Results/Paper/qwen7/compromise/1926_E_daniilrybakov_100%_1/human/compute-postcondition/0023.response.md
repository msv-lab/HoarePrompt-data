Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s` + `x`, `m` is 4, `x` is (n + 1) // 2, and `s` is increased by `x`.**

Explanation: The code `x = (n + 1) // 2` calculates the value of `x` as `(n + 1) // 2` and assigns it to `x`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and the other variables retain their original conditions and values.
