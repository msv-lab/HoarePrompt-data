Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `x` is 1, `s` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `m = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `m`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
