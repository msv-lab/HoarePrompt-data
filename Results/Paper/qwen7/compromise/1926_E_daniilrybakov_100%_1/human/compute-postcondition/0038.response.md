Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` is halved from its current value and is now an integer obtained by dividing the original `n` by 2, `k` is the input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to `x`. Since `n` is halved from its current value and is now an integer obtained by dividing the original `n` by 2, `x` is calculated using this new value of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
