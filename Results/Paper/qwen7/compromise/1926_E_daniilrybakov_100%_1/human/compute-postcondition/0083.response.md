Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 2, `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\), and `s` is \((n + 1) // 2\). If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `s < k and k <= s + x` is not met, the program continues without any changes to the variables.
