Output State: **`n` is now `n // 2`, `x` is (`n + 1`) // 2, `s` is `s + x`, `m` is `m * 2`**.

The code `m *= 2` multiplies the current value of `m` by 2. Since no specific initial value for `m` was given, we keep it in its general form. The values of `n`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
