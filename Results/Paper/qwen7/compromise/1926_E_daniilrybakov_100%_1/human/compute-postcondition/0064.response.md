Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` becomes 1 (since it is continuously halved and will reach 1 when fully divided), `k` is the input integer, `s` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during each iteration, `m` is \(2^3 = 8\) (as `m` is multiplied by 2 for each iteration, and the loop executes 3 times), and `x` is \((n + 1) // 2 = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1\).

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `n` will be 1, `m` will be 8, and `s` will be the cumulative sum of `x` values from each iteration.
