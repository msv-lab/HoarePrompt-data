Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is the input integer, `s` is increased by `x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `x` and retains the initial conditions for the other variables.
