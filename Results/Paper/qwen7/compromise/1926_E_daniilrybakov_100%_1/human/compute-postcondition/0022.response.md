The loop condition is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be non-zero. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is updated to `n // 2`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is updated to `n // 2`, `n` must have been at least 2 at the start of the current iteration to become 1 after the division. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

No other states need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s` + `x`, `m` is 4, `x` is (n + 1) // 2, and `s` is increased by `x`**
