You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Program:
from math import gcd
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
    vprod = [den // r for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if den <= 0:
        print(-1)
        return
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads two lines of input: the first line contains an integer \(N\) representing the size of the list, and the second line contains \(N\) space-separated integers. It then calculates a value `den` by successively applying a function `func_1` to the initial value of the first list element and each subsequent element. Afterward, it computes a list `vprod` where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in the original list, truncating the division result. The function then subtracts the sum of `vprod` from `den`. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and terminates without returning any value. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` joined by spaces.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \( i \), the multiplier \( k_i \) determines the amount received back if that outcome wins.
   - The goal is to find a distribution of bets \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for all } i
     \]

2. **Given Code:**
   - The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{\gcd(a, b)} \).
   - `func_2` reads the input, processes it, and attempts to find a valid distribution of bets.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` reads the number of outcomes \( N \) and the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_N \).
   - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier \( k_1 \).
   - It iterates through the multipliers and updates `den` to be the LCM of `den` and each \( k_i \).
   - It then calculates the values \( vprod \) as \( \frac{\text{den}}{k_i} \) for each \( k_i \).
   - Finally, it checks if the remaining value `den` minus the sum of \( vprod \) is non-negative. If it is, it prints the values; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The approach in `func_2` is flawed because it does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The calculation of `den` as the LCM of all multipliers might not lead to a valid distribution of bets that satisfies the condition.
   - The check `if den <= 0:` is incorrect because it should check if the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - \( N = 3 \)
  - Multipliers: \( 3, 2, 7 \)
  - The code calculates the LCM of 3, 2, and 7, which is 42.
  - The values \( vprod \) are calculated as \( \frac{42}{3}, \frac{42}{2}, \frac{42}{7} \), which are 14, 21, and 6.
  - The remaining value `den` is \( 42 - (14 + 21 + 6) = 1 \), which is positive.
  - The output is `27 41 12`, but this is not a valid distribution because the total bet \( 27 + 41 + 12 = 80 \) is not strictly less than \( 3 \cdot 27 = 81 \), \( 2 \cdot 41 = 82 \), or \( 7 \cdot 12 = 84 \).

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
