Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The function `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\gcd(a, b)} \). However, the solution uses this function incorrectly. It should find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all multipliers, but instead, it finds the LCM of all multipliers and then divides by each individual multiplier to get `vprod`. This approach does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic in `func_2` is flawed. After calculating `den`, which is essentially the GCD of all multipliers, it subtracts the sum of `vprod` from `den`. This subtraction does not guarantee that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome. Instead, it should aim to find a distribution where the total bet is less than the minimum reward.

3. **No Guarantee of Strict Inequality**: The solution does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome. It only checks if the total bet is less than or equal to the minimum reward, which is not sufficient.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this correctly, we need to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the minimum reward. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from math import gcd

def func_2():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    
    # Find the GCD of all multipliers
    min_reward = min(vals)
    total_bet = 1
    for x in vals:
        total_bet *= x // gcd(total_bet, x)
    
    if total_bet >= min_reward:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(' '.join([str(total_bet // x) for x in vals]))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. It finds the GCD of all multipliers.
2. It iteratively multiplies the total bet by each multiplier, ensuring that the total bet is a common multiple of all multipliers.
3. It checks if the total bet is strictly less than the minimum reward. If so, it prints the distribution; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

This ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome.
