### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function takes two integers `a` and `b` (both between 1 and 20 inclusive) and returns their product divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd).
   - The purpose of this function is to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, which is useful for ensuring that the distribution of coins meets the requirement of being strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function processes the input for a single test case.
   - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `k_i` for each outcome.
   - It calculates a denominator `den` by successively applying `func_1` to the initial value and each subsequent multiplier.
   - It then computes a list `vprod` where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding multiplier, truncated to an integer.
   - It subtracts the sum of `vprod` from `den`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and terminates.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` joined by spaces, which represent the amounts to bet on each outcome.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Function 1**:
  - The function correctly computes the LCM of two numbers using their gcd.
  - This is a well-known mathematical property and implementation.

- **Correctness of Function 2**:
  - The logic of calculating `den` by taking the LCM of all multipliers ensures that the total bet is a common multiple of all multipliers.
  - The computation of `vprod` ensures that the bet on each outcome is a fraction of `den` that, when summed, is less than `den`.
  - The subtraction of the sum of `vprod` from `den` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.
  - The handling of the case where `den` is less than or equal to 0 is correct, as it indicates that no valid distribution exists.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem description and the provided functions, the program correctly implements the required logic to determine the distribution of coins for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:
