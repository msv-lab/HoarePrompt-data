Output State: **N is an input integer, and vals is a list of N integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, and vals is updated to a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual integer values, and assigns these values to the list `vals`. Each integer in `vals` is between 2 and 20, inclusive, as per the precondition. The value of `N` remains unchanged, but `vals` is now updated to reflect the list of integers entered by the user.
