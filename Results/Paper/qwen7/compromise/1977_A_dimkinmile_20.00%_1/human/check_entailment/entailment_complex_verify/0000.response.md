### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code:

1. **Problem Description**: The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. Therefore, the difference between the initial number of cubes (which is 0) and the final number of cubes (`m`) must be equal to the net number of moves made (i.e., the number of additions minus the number of removals).

2. **Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` and checks if `n` (the total number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes).
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotation correctly describes the state of the program before and after the function call.
   - The function `func_1()` processes each test case and prints "Yes" if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, and "No" otherwise.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program incorrectly handles cases where `n` is less than `m`. This is incorrect because the problem does not specify that `n` must be greater than or equal to `m`. Instead, the problem specifies that Nikita can add or remove exactly one cube per move, which means the difference between the final number of cubes and the initial number of cubes (0) must be within the range of `n`.

5. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it is always possible to achieve `m` cubes by adding `m` cubes and then removing `n - m` cubes.
   - If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the total number of moves he makes.
   - The current implementation correctly handles both cases:
     - If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints "Yes".
     - If `n` is less than `m`, it prints "No".

Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect because the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
