Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three parameters: t, n, and k, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2. The function returns a value based on the relationship between n and k.**

This means the function is designed to process a series of test cases (indicated by t), where each test case involves two integers n and k, and determine a specific outcome based on their relationship, without directly accepting these parameters as function arguments.
