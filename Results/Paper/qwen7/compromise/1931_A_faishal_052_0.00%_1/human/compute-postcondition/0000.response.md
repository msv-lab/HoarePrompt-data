Output State: **`cases` is an input integer, and `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. This means `cases` now holds the value entered by the user, while the precondition for `t` remains unchanged.
