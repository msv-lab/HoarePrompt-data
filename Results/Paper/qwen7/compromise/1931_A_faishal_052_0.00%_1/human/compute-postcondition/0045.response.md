State: **`arr` is [1, 13, 26], `k` is 0, `k` must be less than 3** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for k in range(3)`, which means `k` will take values from 0 to 2 (inclusive).
2. For the loop to execute, the initial value of `k` must be less than 3.
3. The state of `arr` is given but does not affect the loop's execution directly.
4. Therefore, we need to ensure that `k` starts at 0 and remains less than 3 for the loop to execute.

Hence, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `k` is 0 and must remain less than 3.
