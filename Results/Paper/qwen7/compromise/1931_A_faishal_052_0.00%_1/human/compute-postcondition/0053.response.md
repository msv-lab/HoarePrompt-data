Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**: The loop has already completed all its iterations. This means the loop variable `i` has gone through all values from 0 to 2, inclusive. Therefore, the loop condition `i < cases` is no longer true when `i` becomes 3.

2. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`.

3. **Current Values**: After the loop completes, `k` is set to 2, and `arr` remains unchanged as `[1, 13, 26]`.

4. **Next Iteration Check**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < cases` must be true. However, since `i` is now 3 and `cases` is 3 (because the loop ran from 0 to 2), the condition `i < cases` is false.

5. **Adjusting States**: Since the loop cannot execute one more time due to the current values of `i` and `cases`, we do not need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time. The states remain as they are after the loop has completed.

Therefore, the states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time because the loop has already completed all its iterations.

**State: **`k` is 2, `arr` is [1, 13, 26]**.
