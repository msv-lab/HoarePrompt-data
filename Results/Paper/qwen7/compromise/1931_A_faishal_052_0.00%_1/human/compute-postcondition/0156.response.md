Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for k in range(3)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `k`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `k` is less than 3.

4. **Calculate the next value of `k`**: Since `k` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `k` would be 2.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than 3. Since `k` is currently 2, the loop will continue.

6. **Adjust the state**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `k`, and it should be set to 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`k` is 2**
