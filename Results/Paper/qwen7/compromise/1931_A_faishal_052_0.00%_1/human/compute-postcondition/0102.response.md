Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `k`.
2. **Determine the range of the loop**: The loop runs from `k = 0` to `k = 2` (inclusive), as specified by `range(3)`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `k` is 2.
   - `arr` is a sorted list with the last element being 0.
   - `lex` is 0.

4. **Check if the loop can execute again**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `k < 3`.
   - Since `k` is currently 2, the next value of `k` would be 3, which is not less than 3.
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute again.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will not execute again, no changes are needed for `k`.
   - The state of `arr` and `lex` remains the same as they are not part of the loop head.

Given this analysis, the states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time because the loop will not execute again.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` is 2, `arr` is a sorted list with the last element being 0, `lex` is 0**
