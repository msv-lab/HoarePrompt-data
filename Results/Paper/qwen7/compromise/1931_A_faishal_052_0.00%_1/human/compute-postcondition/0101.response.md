Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `k` is 2.
   - `arr` is a sorted list with the last element being 0. Since it's a sorted list and the last element is 0, the list must be something like `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0]` (with at least 3 elements).
   - `lex` is 0, but this variable is not used in the print statement.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement to execute is `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')`.

3. **Value Calculation**:
   - `k` is 2, so we need to look at `arr[2]`.
   - Since `arr` is a sorted list ending in 0, and assuming it has at least 3 elements (as it needs to have an index 2), the value of `arr[2]` would be 0 (because it's sorted and ends in 0).

4. **Character Conversion**:
   - We then convert `arr[2] + 96` to a character using `chr()`.
   - `arr[2]` is 0, so `arr[2] + 96` is `0 + 96`, which equals 96.
   - The ASCII character corresponding to 96 is `|`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is the character `|`.

Output: **|**
