Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `lex` is an integer.
- `arr` is a list.
- If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains the value 1.
- If `lex` is between 26 and 51, `arr` remains unchanged and still contains the element 26.
- The case where `lex` is less than 26 does not apply as per the given precondition.

### Loop Head
```
for j in range(2):
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `j` ranges from 0 to 1 (inclusive).
- There are no changes made to `lex` or `arr` within the loop body as it is omitted.
- The loop itself does not modify `lex` or `arr`; it only iterates twice.

### States to Adjust
Since the loop does not change the values of `lex` or `arr`, the states of these variables remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final State
- `lex` is an integer.
- `arr` is a list.
- If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains the value 1.
- If `lex` is between 26 and 51, `arr` remains unchanged and still contains the element 26.
- The case where `lex` is less than 26 does not apply as per the given precondition.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged.

### Answer
State: **`lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains the value 1. If `lex` is between 26 and 51, `arr` remains unchanged and still contains the element 26. If `lex` is less than 26, this case does not apply as per the given precondition.**
