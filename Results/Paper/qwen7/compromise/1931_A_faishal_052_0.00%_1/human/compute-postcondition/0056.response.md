State: **`k` is 2, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer, `j` must be between 0 and 1 inclusive**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `j`, which is initialized in the `range(2)` function call.
2. For the loop to execute, `j` must take on values within the range specified by `range(2)`, which means `j` must be between 0 and 1 inclusive.
3. The initial values of `k` and `arr` do not affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.
4. The value of `lex` is also irrelevant to the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted either.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is that `j` must be between 0 and 1 inclusive.
