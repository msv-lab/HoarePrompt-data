Output State: **`k` is 2, `arr` is a list containing [2, 26], `lex` is adjusted accordingly, `j` is 1**

Explanation: The code appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` was a list (though its contents were not specified), and now it contains the elements 2 and 26. The variables `k`, `lex`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
