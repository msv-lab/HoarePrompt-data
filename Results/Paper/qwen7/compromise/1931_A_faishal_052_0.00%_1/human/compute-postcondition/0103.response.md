Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `k` is 2.
   - `arr` is a sorted list with the last element being 0. Since it's a sorted list and the last element is 0, the list must look something like `[a, b, 0]` where `a` and `b` are numbers and `b < 0` or `b` could be any number but the list is sorted.
   - `lex` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')` will access the element at index `k` in the list `arr` and then convert it to a character using the `chr` function after adding 96 to it.
   - Since `k` is 2, we need to look at `arr[2]`. According to the initial state, the last element of `arr` is 0, so `arr[2]` is 0.
   - Adding 96 to 0 gives us 96.
   - The `chr(96)` function converts the number 96 to the corresponding character, which is `` (grave accent).

Therefore, the output of the print statement is the character ``.

Output: **`**
