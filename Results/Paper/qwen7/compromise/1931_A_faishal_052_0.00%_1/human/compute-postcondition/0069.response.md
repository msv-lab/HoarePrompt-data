Output State: **`k` is 2; `arr` is a list containing 26; `lex` is an input integer greater than 26 and greater than or equal to 52; `j` must be between 0 and 1 inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the list `arr`. The other variables (`k`, `lex`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
