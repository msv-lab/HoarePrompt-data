Reasoning:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to find the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Lexicographical Smallest Word**: The code attempts to break down the input number into three parts, but it does not ensure that the resulting word is the lexicographically smallest one. The logic inside the nested loops is flawed and does not correctly handle the range of possible values for each character.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Character Positions**: The code tries to split the input number into parts based on the ranges 1-26 and 27-52, but this approach is too simplistic and does not account for all possible valid three-letter words.

3. **Output Logic**: The code sorts the array `arr` and then prints characters corresponding to the sorted values. However, the sorting and subsequent logic do not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word.

Given these issues, the provided code does not produce the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **False**
