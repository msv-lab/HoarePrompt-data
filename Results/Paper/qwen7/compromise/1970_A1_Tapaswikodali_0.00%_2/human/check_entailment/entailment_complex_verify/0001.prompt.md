You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join((char for (_, _, char) in details))
    print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
        
    #State: Output State: `balance` is 0; `details` is a list containing tuples where each tuple has three elements: the first element is the balance value at each iteration, the second element is -i (where i is the index of the character in the string `s`), and the third element is the character from the string `s`. The list is constructed based on the characters in `s`, incrementing `balance` for '(' and decrementing it for ')'.
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join(char for _, _, char in details)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is a string constructed by concatenating the third elements of each tuple in the sorted list `details`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a balanced parentheses string `s` from the input, processes it to maintain a balance count and store details at each step, sorts these details, and then constructs and prints a new string based on the sorted details. The final output is a string that represents the original string `s` but with characters rearranged according to their balance count and index position.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input string `s` using `input()`.
2. **Balance Calculation and Details Collection**:
   - It iterates through each character of the input string.
   - For each character, it updates the balance and appends a tuple containing the balance, negative position (to ensure correct sorting), and the character to the `details` list.
3. **Sorting**:
   - The `details` list is sorted based on the balance (in ascending order) and position (in descending order).
   - This ensures that the sequence is shuffled according to the specified rules.
4. **Result Construction**:
   - The program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list.
   - The negative position is used to break ties in the correct order during sorting.
5. **Output**:
   - The final result is printed as required.

Given the problem statement and the implementation, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described.
