Functionality: **The function reads a balanced parentheses string `s` from the input, processes it to maintain a balance count and store details at each step, sorts these details, and then constructs and prints a new string based on the sorted details. The final output is a string that represents the original string `s` but with characters rearranged according to their balance count and index position.**
