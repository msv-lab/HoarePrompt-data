Output State: `balance` is 0; `details` is a list containing tuples where each tuple has three elements: the first element is the balance value at each iteration, the second element is -i (where i is the index of the character in the string `s`), and the third element is the character from the string `s`. The list is constructed based on the characters in `s`, incrementing `balance` for '(' and decrementing it for ')'.
