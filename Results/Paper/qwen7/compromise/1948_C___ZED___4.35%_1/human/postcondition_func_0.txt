The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4) and an integer \( n \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 2⋅10^5, \( n \) is even). For each test case, it reads two strings of length \( n \), each consisting only of '<' and/or '>'. Based on the conditions specified in the code, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the correct output ('YES' or 'NO') is printed for each one.
