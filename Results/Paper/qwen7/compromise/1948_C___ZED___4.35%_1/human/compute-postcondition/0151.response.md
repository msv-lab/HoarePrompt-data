Output State: **`no_path` is False, `i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `k` is 5, `a` is a new string input by the user, and `a[k]` is not '>'**

Explanation: The line `no_path = False` does not change the value of `no_path`, but rather explicitly sets it to `False`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `a[k]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
