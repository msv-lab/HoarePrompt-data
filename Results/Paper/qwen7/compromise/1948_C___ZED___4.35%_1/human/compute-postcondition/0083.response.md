Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `no_path` is set to `True`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `k` is defined as the highest even number less than or equal to the initial value of `n`.
   - `a` and `b` are strings input by the user.

2. **Determine the Value of `k`**:
   - Since `k` is the highest even number less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than 1, `k` will be the largest even number up to `n-1` if `n` is odd, or `n` itself if `n` is even.

3. **Print Statement Execution**:
   - The print statement `print(k)` will output the value of `k`.

Given the conditions, the value of `k` is determined solely by `n`, and since `n` is greater than 1, `k` will be the largest even number less than or equal to `n`.

Output: **k (where k is the highest even number less than or equal to n)**
