The loop head contains the following variables: `k`.

According to the for loop statement `for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):`, the variable `k` starts from 1 and increments by 2 until it reaches `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `no_path` is False
- `i` is `i_current + 1`
- `n` is an integer greater than 4
- `k` is 1
- `a` is a new string input by the user
- `b` is the new input string
- The current value of `a[k]` is not '>'

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 2. Therefore, `k` should be updated to `1 + 2 = 3`.

State: **`no_path` is False, `i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `k` is 3, `a` is a new string input by the user, `b` is the new input string, and the current value of `a[k]` is not '>'**
