Output State: **`no_path` is False, `n` must be greater than 1, the highest even number less than or equal to the initial value of `n` is assigned to `k`, `a` is a string input by the user, the current value of `a[k]` is not '>', `b` is a string input by the user**.

Explanation: The variable `no_path` is explicitly set to `False`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`) retain their initial conditions and values from the initial state.
