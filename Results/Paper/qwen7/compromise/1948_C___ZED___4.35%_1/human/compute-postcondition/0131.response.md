Output State: **`i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` must be greater than 4, `k` is 4, `a` is a new string input by the user, `b` is the new input string, `no_path` is `False`.**

Explanation: The line `no_path = False` sets the variable `no_path` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
