Postcondition: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, and `b` is a string input by the user. If `b[-2]` is not '>', then `n` is adjusted to be the highest even number less than or equal to its initial value, `k` is either the highest even number less than or equal to the initial value of `n` or the last even number less than `n`, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `no_path` is True, `k` is the highest even number less than or equal to the initial value of `n` and the character at the final position of `k` in `a` is not '>'; if `no_path` is False, `k` is the last even number less than `n` and the character at the final position of `k` in `a` is '>'.

This postcondition covers all possible outcomes of the if-else block, ensuring that the relationships between the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k` (and `no_path`) are accurately described based on the conditions specified.
