Postcondition: `i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` must be greater than 4, `k` is 4, `a` is a new string input by the user, `b` is the new input string, and `no_path` remains `False` if `b[k]` is not `'> '`.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, stating that `i` increments by 1, `n` remains greater than 4, `k` stays at 4, `a` and `b` are as input by the user, and `no_path` does not change to `True` if `b[k]` is not `'> '`.
