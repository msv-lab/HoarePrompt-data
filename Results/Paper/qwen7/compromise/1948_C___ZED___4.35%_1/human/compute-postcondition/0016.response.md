Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `k` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `k` in the range from `0` to `n` with a step of `2`. This means `k` will take on values `0, 2, 4, ...` up to the largest even number less than or equal to `n-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - If `b[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` is False.

4. **Determine the next value of `k`**: Since the loop increments `k` by 2 each time, the next value of `k` would be `2`.

5. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `k` (which will be `2` in the next iteration) must still be within the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - Additionally, if `b[2]` is not '>', then `no_path` should remain `False`.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `k` will be `2`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `0`.
   - If `b[2]` is not '>', then `no_path` should remain `False`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`k` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, and if `b[2]` is not '>', then `no_path` is False**.
