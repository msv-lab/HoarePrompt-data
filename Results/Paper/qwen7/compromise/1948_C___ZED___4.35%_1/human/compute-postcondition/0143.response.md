Postcondition: `no_path` is False, `i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `k` is 1, `a` is a new string input by the user, `b` is the new input string, and the current value of `a[k]` is not '>'.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `no_path` becomes False, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains an integer greater than 4, `k` is set to 1, `a` and `b` retain their new string inputs, and specifically, `a[k]` is not the character '>'.
