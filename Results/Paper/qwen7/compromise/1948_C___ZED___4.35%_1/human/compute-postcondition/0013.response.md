Output State: **`k` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the value of `b[k]` is not '>', `no_path` is False.**

Explanation: The variable `no_path` is assigned the boolean value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of `k`, `n`, or the elements of the list `b`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
