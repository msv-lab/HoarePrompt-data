Output State: **no_path is False, i is i_current + 1, n is an integer greater than 4, k is n - 1, a is a new string input by the user, and a[k] is not '>'.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `no_path` remains `False`, `i` is incremented by the number of iterations (which is `(n - 1) / 2` since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1` with a step of `2`), `n` remains an integer greater than 4, `k` is now `n - 1` (since the loop increments `k` by `2` each time and stops when `k` reaches `n - 1`), `a` is still the new string input by the user, and the character at index `k` in `a` is not `'>'`.
