Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the variables that change within the loop. In this case, the loop iterates over `k` using the range `range(0, n, 2)`. This means `k` starts at 0 and increments by 2 until it reaches a value that is no longer less than `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - If `b[2]` is not '>', then `no_path` remains False

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `k < n`.
   - Since `k` is currently 2, the next value of `k` would be 4 (if `n` is greater than or equal to 4).

4. **Update the state**:
   - `k` will be incremented by 2, so `k` becomes 4.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - The condition `b[2]` not being '>' does not affect the value of `k` or `n`, but it ensures that `no_path` remains False as long as `b[2]` is not '>', which is already true.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`k` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0, and if `b[2]` is not '>', then `no_path` remains False**
