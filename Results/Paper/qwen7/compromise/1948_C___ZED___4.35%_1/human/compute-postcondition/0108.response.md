Postcondition: `n` is an integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `no_path` is a boolean, `k` is an integer. If `n` equals 1, then `no_path` is True, `k` is the highest even number less than or equal to the initial value of `n`, and the character at the final position of `k` in `a` is not '>'. Otherwise, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to the highest even number less than or equal to its initial value, `k` is either the highest even number less than or equal to the initial value of `n` or the last even number less than `n`, and if `no_path` is True, `k` is the highest even number less than or equal to the initial value of `n` and the character at the final position of `k` in `a` is not '>', if `no_path` is False, `k` is the last even number less than `n` and the character at the final position of `k` in `a` is '>'.
