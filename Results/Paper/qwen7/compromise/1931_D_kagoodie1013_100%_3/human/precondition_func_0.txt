test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) representing the size of the array and Polycarp's favorite integers, followed by a list of n integers representing the elements of the array. The length of each tuple is n + 3, and it is guaranteed that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
