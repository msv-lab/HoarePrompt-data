Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it initializes the necessary variables and iterates through the array to calculate the number of beautiful pairs.
3. It uses a dictionary (`residue_map`) to keep track of the counts of specific residue pairs `(r_x, r_y)` which are derived from the conditions given in the problem statement.
4. The logic for calculating `r_x` and `r_y` is correct:
   - `r_x = -num % x` ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
   - `r_y = num % y` ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
5. The count of beautiful pairs is incremented based on the existing counts in the `residue_map` for the current residue pair.
6. The final result for each test case is correctly appended to the `results` list.
7. The program structure and logic align with the problem requirements and constraints.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
