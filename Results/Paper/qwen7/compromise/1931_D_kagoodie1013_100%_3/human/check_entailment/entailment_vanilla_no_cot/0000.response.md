Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given problem description. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case, and calculates the number of beautiful pairs using the `func_1` function. The logic within `func_1` is sound, and it efficiently uses a dictionary to keep track of residues, ensuring that the solution works within the constraints provided.
