Output State: **`count` is 0 + residue_map.get((-num % x, num % y), 0); `residue_map` is a dictionary with key `(num % x, num % y)` mapped to `1`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`**

Explanation: The code updates the `residue_map` dictionary by incrementing the count for the current key `(num % x, num % y)` by 1. Since `residue_map` was initially an empty dictionary, the value for the key `(num % x, num % y)` is set to 1. The `count` variable remains unchanged from its initial state, which is `0 + residue_map.get((-num % x, num % y), 0)`. The `current_key` variable also remains unchanged and is still `(num % x, num % y)`.
