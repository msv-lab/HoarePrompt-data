Output State: **`count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` must be defined, `arr` must be a non-empty list, `r_x` is `-num % x`**

Explanation: The code calculates the remainder of `-num` divided by `x` and assigns it to `r_x`. Since the exact values of `num` and `x` are not specified, `r_x` is expressed as `-num % x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
