Output State: **`count` is the sum of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each `num` in `arr`, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y` for each iteration, `arr` is an empty list, `r_x` is `-num % x` for each `num` in `arr`, `r_y` is `num % y` for each `num` in `arr`, `residue_map` contains the count of each unique `(num % x, num % y)` pair in `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`.**

Explanation: The code appends the final value of `count` to the list `results`. Since `count` is already calculated as the sum of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each `num` in `arr`, appending `count` to `results` does not change its value. The list `arr` remains empty, and the values of `current_key`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `residue_map` remain unchanged as well. The only new information is that `results` now contains the final value of `count`.
