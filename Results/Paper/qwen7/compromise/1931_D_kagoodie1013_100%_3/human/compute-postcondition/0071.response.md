Output State: `count` is the sum of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each `num` in `arr`, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y` for each iteration, `arr` is an empty list after all elements have been processed, `r_x` is `-num % x` for each `num` in `arr`, `r_y` is `num % y` for each `num` in `arr`, `residue_map` contains the count of each unique `(num % x, num % y)` pair in `arr`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `count` will be the total number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` found in `residue_map` for each element in `arr`. The `arr` list will be empty since all elements have been processed. The `current_key` will be the result of `num % x, num % y` for each `num` in `arr`. The `r_x` and `r_y` values are derived from each `num` as specified in the loop. The `residue_map` will store the frequency of each unique `(num % x, num % y)` pair encountered in `arr`.
