Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `num` which iterates over the elements of `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `num`**: Since `num` is iterating over the elements of `arr`, the first value of `num` will be the first element of `arr`.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `count` is not directly related to the loop's execution; its initial value (0) does not affect whether the loop runs or not.
   - `n`, `x`, and `y` are not used in the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.
   - `arr` is the collection that `num` iterates over. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element.
   - `residue_map` is not used in the loop, so its state does not need to be adjusted.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `arr` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`arr` must contain at least one element**
