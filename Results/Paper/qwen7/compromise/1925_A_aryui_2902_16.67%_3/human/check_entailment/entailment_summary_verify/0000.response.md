### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to determine its correctness.

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from standard input.
   - It constructs a string `s` consisting of the first \( k \) characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`, repeated \( n \) times.
   - This means the string `s` will be composed of the first \( k \) lowercase letters, repeated \( n \) times.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \), the function will generate the string `"abcabc"`.
   - We need to check if all possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 3 letters (`"ab"`, `"ac"`, `"ba"`, `"bc"`, `"ca"`, `"cb"`) are present in `"abcabc"`.

3. **Checking Subsequences**:
   - `"ab"`: Present as `"ab"` in `"abcabc"`.
   - `"ac"`: Present as `"ac"` in `"abcabc"`.
   - `"ba"`: Present as `"ba"` in `"abcabc"`.
   - `"bc"`: Present as `"bc"` in `"abcabc"`.
   - `"ca"`: Not present in `"abcabc"` in the required order.
   - `"cb"`: Not present in `"abcabc"` in the required order.

Since the string `"abcabc"` does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 3 letters, the function summary indicates that the program is incorrect.

However, let's consider the problem statement again. The goal is to find a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The program's approach of repeating the first `k` characters `n` times does not guarantee that all subsequences will be present.

Given the function summary and the analysis, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters are present in the generated string `s`.
