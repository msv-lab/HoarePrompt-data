Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases internally. Each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function returns a specific value or result based on the given conditions for each test case.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates through multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers within specified ranges. However, based solely on the provided information about the function signature and output, the function itself does not accept any parameters but rather processes the data provided in the test cases. The exact nature of the return value (e.g., whether it's a summary statistic, a boolean, a string, etc.) is not specified in the given information.
