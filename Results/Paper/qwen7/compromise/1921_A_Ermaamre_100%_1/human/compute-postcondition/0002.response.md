Output State: The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and for each iteration of the loop, the output is the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the first column of a 4x2 matrix of integers provided by user input. After all iterations, the final printed value is the result of the last loop's computation.
