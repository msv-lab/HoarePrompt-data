Output State: The value of `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. For each iteration of the loop, a 4x2 matrix `a` is read from input, and `dx` is calculated as the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the first column of `a`. The result `dx * dx` is printed for each iteration. After all iterations, the final value of `t` remains unchanged, but the printed output consists of the computed `dx * dx` values for each iteration.
