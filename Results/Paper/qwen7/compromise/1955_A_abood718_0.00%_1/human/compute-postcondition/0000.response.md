Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - The initial state given is that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a value within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop depends on the input from `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range.
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that will be read by `int(input())`. This value should be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.
