Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, where each line is determined by the values of \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) for each test case. Specifically:

- If \(B \times 2 < C\), the output will be \(A \times B\).
- If \(A\) is even, the output will be \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\).
- If \(A\) is odd, the output will first print \(X = \frac{A}{2}\) (integer division), followed by \(X \times C + B\).

Each test case's output is independent of others, and the total output will be the concatenation of outputs from all test cases.
