Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, n, a, and b, where t is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers within specific ranges. It returns a value based on the given conditions for n, a, and b.**

This means the function indirectly accepts parameters through variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, with `t` being a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `n`, `a`, and `b` being integers within their respective ranges. The function processes these variables and returns a value based on the specified conditions for `n`, `a`, and `b`.
