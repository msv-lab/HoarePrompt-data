Reasoning:

1. The problem requires calculating the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts, considering both the regular price (`a`) and the promotional price (`b`).
2. The given code iterates over `t` test cases, and for each test case, it correctly calculates the minimum cost based on the conditions provided in the problem statement.
3. The logic within the loop is as follows:
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying two yogurts for `b` is cheaper than buying them individually at `a`. In this case, the cost is calculated as `A * a`.
   - If `A` is even, it directly calculates the cost as `(A * b) / 2`.
   - If `A` is odd, it splits the purchase into the maximum number of pairs (which is `A // 2`) and buys the remaining yogurt separately. The cost is calculated as `(A // 2) * b + a`.

Given the logic and the conditions in the code match the problem statement, the provided solution appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
