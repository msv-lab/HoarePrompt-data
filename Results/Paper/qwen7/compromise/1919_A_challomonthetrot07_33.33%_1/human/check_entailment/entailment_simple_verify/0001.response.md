### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - **Correct**

2. **Handling Equal Coins:**
   - If `a == b`, the program prints 'Bob'.
   - **Correct**: If both players have the same number of coins, Bob can always force a win by mirroring Alice's moves until Alice runs out of coins.

3. **Handling Single Coin:**
   - If `a == 1`, the program prints 'Alice'.
   - **Correct**: Alice can remove the last coin from her wallet and force Bob to lose.
   - If `b == 1`, the program prints 'Bob'.
   - **Correct**: Bob can remove the last coin from his wallet and force Alice to lose.

4. **Handling Odd Number of Coins:**
   - If `a % 2 == 1`, the program prints 'Bob'.
   - **Correct**: Alice can never win if she starts with an odd number of coins. She will always be left with an even number of coins after her move, and Bob can mirror her moves to ensure he wins.

5. **Handling Even Number of Coins:**
   - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`, the program prints 'Alice'.
   - **Correct**: Alice can force a win by removing one coin and then mirroring Bob's moves.
   - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 0` and `a <= b`, the program prints 'Bob'.
   - **Incorrect**: This condition is not comprehensive. We need to consider all scenarios where Alice might win. For example, if `a = 4` and `b = 2`, Alice can remove one coin and then Bob will be forced into a losing position.

6. **Default Case:**
   - The default case (`else`) prints 'Alice'.
   - **Incorrect**: This does not cover all scenarios. For example, if `a = 2` and `b = 4`, Alice should lose, but the program incorrectly prints 'Alice'.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0 and a < b:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

The original assessment was inaccurate due to the incorrect handling of the default case and the scenario where `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 0` with `a < b`.

Final: **False**
