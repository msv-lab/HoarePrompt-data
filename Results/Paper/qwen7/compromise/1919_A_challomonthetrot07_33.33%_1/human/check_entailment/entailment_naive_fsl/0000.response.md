Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the optimal strategy for both players when the number of coins in their wallets is odd or even. Let's analyze a few cases:

1. **Case: Both Alice and Bob have an odd number of coins**
   - Example: \(a = 3\), \(b = 3\)
   - According to the program, since \(a \neq b\) and neither \(a\) nor \(b\) is 1, it prints 'Alice'. However, if both players play optimally, they will swap wallets until one of them has 1 coin, leading to a win for Bob.

2. **Case: Both Alice and Bob have an even number of coins**
   - Example: \(a = 4\), \(b = 4\)
   - According to the program, since \(a = b\), it prints 'Bob'. However, if both players play optimally, they will swap wallets until one of them has 1 coin, leading to a win for Alice.

3. **Case: Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins**
   - Example: \(a = 4\), \(b = 3\)
   - According to the program, since \(a > b\), it prints 'Bob'. However, if both players play optimally, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets and reducing her own coins to 1, leading to a win for Alice.

These examples show that the program does not always determine the correct winner based on the optimal strategy. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
