The function reads an integer T from the user, indicating the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads two integers a and b, and prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on specific conditions related to the values of a and b. The final output consists of a series of lines, each containing either 'Alice' or 'Bob', depending on the input values of a and b for each iteration.
