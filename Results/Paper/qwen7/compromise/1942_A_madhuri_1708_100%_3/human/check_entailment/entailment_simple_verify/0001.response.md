### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array \(a\) of length \(n\) such that exactly \(k\) out of its \(n\) cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - For \(k \geq 2\):
     - If \(n = k\), we can create a sorted array of length \(k\) and it will be the only sorted cyclic shift.
     - Otherwise, it's impossible to have exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts for \(k < n\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads input from standard input and processes each test case.
   - It splits the input string into \(n\) and \(k\).
   - If \(k \geq 2\):
     - If \(n = k\), it prints a sorted array of length \(k\).
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1`.
   - If \(k = 1\), it prints an array where each element is its index plus one, ensuring that only the original array is sorted.

3. **Checking Correctness:**
   - For \(k \geq 2\):
     - If \(n = k\), the code correctly generates a sorted array of length \(k\).
     - If \(n \neq k\), the code correctly prints `-1`, which is the right answer because it's impossible to have exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts when \(k < n\).
   - For \(k = 1\):
     - The code generates an array where each element is its index plus one, ensuring that only the original array is sorted, which is correct.

However, there is a critical flaw in the code for the case when \(k = 1\) and \(n > 1\). The code only checks if \(k \geq 2\) and handles this case separately. For \(k = 1\), the code prints an array where each element is its index plus one, but this approach does not guarantee that exactly one cyclic shift will be sorted. In fact, for \(n > 1\), the array generated by `[j + 1 for j in range(n)]` will always be sorted, meaning it will have more than one sorted cyclic shift, which violates the requirement of having exactly one sorted cyclic shift.

### Example Counterexample:
Consider the test case:
```
3
2 1
3 1
4 1
```

- For the first test case (\(n = 2, k = 1\)):
  - The code prints `[1, 2]`, which has two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2]` and `[2, 1]`.
- For the second test case (\(n = 3, k = 1\)):
  - The code prints `[1, 2, 3]`, which has three sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 1]`, and `[3, 1, 2]`.
- For the third test case (\(n = 4, k = 1\)):
  - The code prints `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, which has four sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, `[2, 3, 4, 1]`, `[3, 4, 1, 2]`, and `[4, 1, 2, 3]`.

These examples show that the code incorrectly prints arrays that have more than one sorted cyclic shift when \(k = 1\) and \(n > 1\).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle the case when \(k = 1\) and \(n > 1\), as it does not ensure exactly one sorted cyclic shift.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
