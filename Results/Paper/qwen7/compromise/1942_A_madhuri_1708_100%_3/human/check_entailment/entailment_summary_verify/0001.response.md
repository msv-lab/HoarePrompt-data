### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array \(a\) of length \(n\) such that exactly \(k\) out of its \(n\) cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - For \(k \geq 2\):
     - If \(n = k\), we can create a sorted array of length \(k\) and it will be the only sorted cyclic shift.
     - Otherwise, it's impossible to have exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts for \(k < n\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads input from standard input and processes each test case.
   - It splits the input string into \(n\) and \(k\).
   - If \(k \geq 2\):
     - If \(n = k\), it prints a sorted array of length \(k\).
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1`.
   - If \(k = 1\), it prints an array where each element is its index plus one, ensuring that only the original array is sorted.

3. **Checking Correctness:**
   - For \(k \geq 2\):
     - If \(n = k\), the code correctly generates a sorted array of length \(k\).
     - However, the code does not handle the case where \(k < n\) and \(n > k\). According to the problem statement, it should print `-1` in this case, but the code incorrectly prints a sorted array of length \(k\).
   - For \(k = 1\):
     - The code generates an array where each element is its index plus one, ensuring that only the original array is sorted, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it fails to handle the case where \(k < n\) and \(n > k\). In such cases, it should print `-1` instead of a sorted array of length \(k\).

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect.
