You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3 and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])
        
    #State: Output State: The output consists of lines where each line corresponds to a test case. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, and `n` is equal to `k`, it prints a line with `k` occurrences of `k`. Otherwise, if `k` is less than 2, it prints a line with numbers from 1 to `n`. If `n` is not equal to `k` and `k` is at least 2, it prints `-1`. The total number of lines does not exceed 1000, corresponding to the sum of `n` over all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it prints either a line with \( k \) occurrences of \( k \) if \( n \) equals \( k \) and \( k \geq 2 \), or a line with numbers from 1 to \( n \) if \( k < 2 \). If \( n \neq k \) and \( k \geq 2 \), it prints `-1`. The total number of lines printed does not exceed 1000.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array \(a\) of length \(n\) such that exactly \(k\) out of its \(n\) cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - For \(k \geq 2\):
     - If \(n = k\), we can create a sorted array of length \(k\) and it will be the only sorted cyclic shift.
     - Otherwise, it's impossible to have exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts for \(k < n\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads input from standard input and processes each test case.
   - It splits the input string into \(n\) and \(k\).
   - If \(k \geq 2\):
     - If \(n = k\), it prints a sorted array of length \(k\).
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1`.
   - If \(k = 1\), it prints an array where each element is its index plus one, ensuring that only the original array is sorted.

3. **Checking Correctness:**
   - For \(k \geq 2\):
     - If \(n = k\), the code correctly generates a sorted array of length \(k\).
     - If \(n \neq k\), the code correctly prints `-1`, which is the right answer because it's impossible to have exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts when \(k < n\).
   - For \(k = 1\):
     - The code generates an array where each element is its index plus one, ensuring that only the original array is sorted, which is correct.

The given program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem statement.
