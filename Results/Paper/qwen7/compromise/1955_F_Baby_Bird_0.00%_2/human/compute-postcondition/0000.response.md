Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used to iterate over the range. It is typically not named in the loop body, but it is part of the loop head.
   - `int(input())`: This is the expression that determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not require adjustment since it is just a counter.
   - The variable `int(input())` is the one that controls the number of iterations. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `int(input())` is a positive integer.

3. **Initial state information**: The initial state given is that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Given this, the loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer within the specified range. Therefore, we need to ensure that `int(input())` is a positive integer.

**State after adjustment**:
- The variable `t` is already given as a positive integer within the specified range, so no change is needed for `t`.
- We need to ensure that `int(input())` returns a value that is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `int(input())` returns a valid positive integer.

**Final State**:
State: **`int(input())` must return a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4**
