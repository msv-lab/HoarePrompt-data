Functionality: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k` (where 2 ≤ k ≤ 100). It processes the list to create a dictionary where each key is a unique number from the list and its value is the maximum count of that number in the list, capped at `k`. If any number appears more than `k` times in the list, its count in the dictionary is set to `k`.
