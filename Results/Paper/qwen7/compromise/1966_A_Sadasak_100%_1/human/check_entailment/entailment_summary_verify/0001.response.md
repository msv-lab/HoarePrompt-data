### Reasoning

The original assessment identified several issues with the provided program, particularly with the logic in `func_1` and the way the remaining cards were calculated. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return a dictionary where each key is a unique number from the list `arr`, and the corresponding value is the maximum count of that number in the list, capped at `k`.
   - However, the function logic incorrectly sets the count of any number to `k` if its frequency exceeds `k`. This does not align with the problem statement, which allows exchanging `k` cards for `k-1` new cards but does not restrict the frequency of card numbers.

2. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The main program logic is flawed because it uses the output of `func_1` in an incorrect manner.
   - If `k` is present in the frequency table, it prints `k - 1`. This logic is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of further reductions in the number of cards.
   - If `k` is not present, it prints `n`. This is also incorrect because it doesn't consider the possibility of reducing the number of cards through multiple operations.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Count the frequency of each card number.
2. Determine how many groups of `k` cards can be formed.
3. Calculate the remaining cards after performing the maximum possible operations.

### Corrected Program

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each card number
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in nums:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the number of full groups of k cards
    full_groups = sum(f // k for f in frequency_table.values())
    
    # Calculate the remaining cards
    remaining_cards = n - full_groups * (k - 1)
    
    print(remaining_cards)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Count Frequencies:**
   - We count the frequency of each card number using a dictionary.

2. **Calculate Full Groups:**
   - We calculate the number of full groups of `k` cards that can be formed by summing up `f // k` for each frequency `f`.

3. **Calculate Remaining Cards:**
   - The remaining cards are calculated as `n - full_groups * (k - 1)`.

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_1` and the incorrect handling of the remaining cards. The corrected program accurately implements the solution based on the problem description.

**Final: False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the flaws in the program. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
