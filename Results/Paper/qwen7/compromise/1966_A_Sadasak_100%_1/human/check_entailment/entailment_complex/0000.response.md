Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves reducing the number of cards by performing operations where we can exchange groups of `k` identical cards for `k-1` new cards. The goal is to minimize the number of cards left.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, so the answer is `n`.
   - Otherwise, we need to consider the frequency of each card type and how many cards of each type can remain after operations.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the frequency table, ensuring that no number appears more than `k` times.
   - This is crucial because it helps determine how many cards of each type can remain without violating the operation rules.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly handles the edge case where `k > n`.
   - For the general case, it calls `func_1` and checks if `k` itself appears as a value in the frequency table. If it does, it prints `k - 1` (since we can reduce the count of `k` to `k - 1`).
   - If `k` does not appear as a value, it prints `n` (indicating no further reduction is possible).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k > n` by printing `n`.
   - The logic for checking if `k` appears in the frequency values and printing `k - 1` is correct.
   - The final print statement of `n` when `k` does not appear in the frequency values is also correct.

Given the analysis, the program logic matches the problem requirements and correctly implements the solution.

Correctness: **True**
