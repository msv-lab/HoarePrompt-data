Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not designed to handle the requirements of the problem. The problem requires finding the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the specified operations, but the current implementation of `func_1` only limits the frequency of each number to `k`, without considering how to minimize the total number of cards.

For instance, consider the following test case:
```
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```

The correct solution should be 2, as we can exchange the three 4s for two cards, leaving us with two cards (one 1 and one 4). However, the provided code will not correctly handle this scenario because it simply limits the frequency of each number to `k` without actually performing the exchanges to minimize the number of cards.

The correct approach would involve identifying groups of cards that can be exchanged and reducing their count accordingly. The current implementation does not achieve this.
