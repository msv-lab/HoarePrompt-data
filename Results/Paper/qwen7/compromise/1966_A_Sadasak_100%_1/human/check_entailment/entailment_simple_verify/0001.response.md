### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several issues with the provided program:

1. **Flawed Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly caps the frequency of any card number at `k` if it exceeds `k`. This does not align with the problem statement, which allows exchanging `k` cards for `k-1` new cards without restricting the frequency of card numbers.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Cards:**
   - The program checks if `k` is present in the frequency table and prints `k - 1` if true, and `n` otherwise. This logic is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of further reductions in the number of cards through multiple operations.

The corrected program provided in the original assessment addresses these issues:

1. **Count Frequencies:**
   - We count the frequency of each card number using a dictionary.

2. **Calculate Full Groups:**
   - We calculate the number of full groups of `k` cards that can be formed by summing up `f // k` for each frequency `f`.

3. **Calculate Remaining Cards:**
   - The remaining cards are calculated as `n - full_groups * (k - 1)`.

This approach ensures that we correctly determine the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the allowed operations.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the corrected program and the detailed explanation, the original program is indeed incorrect. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
