Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Handling Edge Case:**
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This is correct because if you cannot form a group of `k` cards, you cannot perform any operations, and thus, the minimum number of cards remains `n`.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in the list.
   - However, the logic inside `func_1` is flawed. It reduces the count of any card number to `k` if its frequency exceeds `k`. This does not align with the problem statement, which allows exchanging `k` cards for `k-1` new cards but does not restrict the frequency of card numbers.

4. **Determining Minimum Cards:**
   - After calling `func_1`, the program checks if `k` is present in the frequency table.
     - If `k` is present, it prints `k - 1`. This logic is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of further reductions in the number of cards.
     - If `k` is not present, it prints `n`. This is also incorrect because it doesn't consider the possibility of reducing the number of cards through multiple operations.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Count the frequency of each card number.
2. Determine how many groups of `k` cards can be formed.
3. Calculate the remaining cards after performing the maximum possible operations.

### Corrected Program

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each card number
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in nums:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the number of full groups of k cards
    full_groups = sum(f // k for f in frequency_table.values())
    
    # Calculate the remaining cards
    remaining_cards = n - full_groups * (k - 1)
    
    print(remaining_cards)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Count Frequencies:**
   - We count the frequency of each card number using a dictionary.

2. **Calculate Full Groups:**
   - We calculate the number of full groups of `k` cards that can be formed by summing up `f // k` for each frequency `f`.

3. **Calculate Remaining Cards:**
   - The remaining cards are calculated as `n - full_groups * (k - 1)`.

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_1` and the incorrect handling of the remaining cards. The corrected program accurately implements the solution based on the problem description.

**Correctness: **False**
