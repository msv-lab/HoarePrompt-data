Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: If `b <= a`, the program prints `n * a`. This is correct because if the modified price (`b`) is less than or equal to the usual price (`a`), there is no benefit in using the promotion, and Bob should sell all buns at the usual price.
   - **Case 2**: If `b - a >= n`, the program prints \(\frac{(2 * b - n + 1) * n}{2}\). This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - (n-1)`. This is correct because in this scenario, it is more profitable to sell the first `n` buns at the modified prices.
   - **Case 3**: Otherwise, the program prints \(\frac{(b - a) * (b - a + 1)}{2} + a * n\). This formula calculates the sum of the first `b - a` natural numbers (which represents the sum of the modified prices) plus the usual price for the remaining buns. This is also correct as it accounts for the optimal way to use the promotion.

3. **Output**: The program prints the calculated profit for each test case, which matches the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic for calculating the maximum profit based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
