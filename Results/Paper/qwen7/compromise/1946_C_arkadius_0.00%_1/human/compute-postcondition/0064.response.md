Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1; `tree.vertices[u].good_components` remains unchanged; `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`; `u` is the next child of `tree.vertices[v]`.**

This means that the value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been incremented by 1, while `tree.vertices[u].good_components` stays the same. Additionally, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. The relationship between `u` and `v` as the next child remains unchanged.
