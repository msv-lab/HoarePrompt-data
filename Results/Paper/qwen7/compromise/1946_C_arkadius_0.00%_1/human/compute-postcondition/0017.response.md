The loop head consists of the variables `beg`, `end`, and `mid`. The loop condition is `beg < end`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `beg < end` must be true.

Let's analyze the possible outcomes:

1. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns `True`:
   - `beg` remains `mid`
   - `end` remains `n`
   - `mid` becomes `(1 + n + 1) // 2`

   In this case, we need to check if `beg < end` still holds true. Since `beg` is now `mid` and `end` is `n`, we need to ensure that `mid < n`.

2. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns `False`:
   - `beg` becomes `mid`
   - `end` becomes `mid - 1`
   - `mid` remains `(1 + n + 1) // 2`

   In this case, we need to check if `beg < end` still holds true. Since `end` is now `mid - 1`, we need to ensure that `beg < mid - 1`. Given that `beg` is now `mid`, this means `mid < mid - 1`, which is impossible. Therefore, the loop cannot continue under these conditions.

Since the loop can only continue if `beg < end` holds true, and given the two possible outcomes, we need to ensure that `beg < end` is true after the adjustment. This means we need to ensure that `mid < n` when `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns `True`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `mid < n`.

State: **`beg`, `end`, and `mid` are adjusted based on the outcome of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`, and `mid` must be less than `n`.**
