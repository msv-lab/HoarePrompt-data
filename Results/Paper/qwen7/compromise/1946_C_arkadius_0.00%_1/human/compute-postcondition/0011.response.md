Output State: The loop will have executed `n-1` times, meaning `i` will be `n-1`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, representing the number of vertices in the tree. The variable `k` remains unchanged, as it was not modified within the loop. The `tree` object will have `n-1` edges, each defined by pairs of vertices `(u-1, v-1)` that were added through the `add_edge` method based on user inputs during each iteration of the loop. In natural language, this means that the tree will have exactly `n-1` edges connecting all `n` vertices, forming a valid tree structure.
