Postcondition: **The stack contains tuples for each child of vertex v. Each tuple is of the form (u, False), indicating that none of the children have been fully processed or marked as special (i.e., their remaining_size did not meet the condition >= x to be marked as (u, True)). If any child's remaining_size met the condition during the loop, there might be one tuple of the form (u, True) in the stack, but this is not guaranteed for every child. Additionally, the postorder traversal has been initiated.**
