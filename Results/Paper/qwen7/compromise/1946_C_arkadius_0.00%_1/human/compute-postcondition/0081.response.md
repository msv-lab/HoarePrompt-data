Postcondition: **The `stack` contains a series of tuples `(u, False)` where each `u` is a successive child vertex from `tree.vertices[v].children`. This is true regardless of whether `postorder` is `True` or `False`, but since the if condition is `postorder`, the `stack` now specifically indicates that we are in postorder traversal mode.**
