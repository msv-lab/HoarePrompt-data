You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: `tree` is an instance of a class representing a tree where each vertex has attributes `children`, `good_components`, and `remaining_size`. `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, and `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing the edges.
def func_1(tree, s, x):
    stack = [(s, False)]
    while stack:
        v, postorder = stack.pop()
        
        if not postorder:
            stack.append((v, True))
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                stack.append((u, False))
        
        if postorder:
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
                if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                    tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
                else:
                    tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size
        
    #State: All vertices in the tree have their `good_components` attribute set to the sum of `good_components` from all their children plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. The `remaining_size` attribute of each vertex is the total `remaining_size` of all its children.
    return tree.vertices[s].good_components, tree.vertices[s].remaining_size
    #The program returns the tuple containing the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of the vertex with the identifier `s` in the tree. The `good_components` attribute is calculated as the sum of `good_components` from all its children plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. The `remaining_size` attribute is the total `remaining_size` of all its children.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a tree (an instance of a class with attributes `children`, `good_components`, and `remaining_size`), a starting vertex `s`, and a minimum size `x`. It returns a tuple containing the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of the vertex with the identifier `s`. The `good_components` is calculated as the sum of `good_components` from all its children plus the count of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. The `remaining_size` is the total `remaining_size` of all its children.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the tuple containing the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of the vertex with the identifier `s` in the tree. The `good_components` attribute is calculated as the sum of `good_components` from all its children plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. The `remaining_size` attribute is the total `remaining_size` of all its children.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
