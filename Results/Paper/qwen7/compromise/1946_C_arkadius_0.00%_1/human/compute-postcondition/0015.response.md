Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data from standard input. It reads t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) test cases, where each test case includes integers n and k, followed by n-1 lines describing the edges of a tree. For each test case, it removes k edges from the tree using the custom Tree class's methods and returns the result.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each involving a tree defined by its vertices and edges, and performs edge removal operations based on the given number of edges to remove (k).
