Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components` will contain the sum of `good_components` from all children of vertex `v` plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`; `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will be the total `remaining_size` of all children of vertex `v`; `stack` has one more element, which is the tuple `(v, True)` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `stack.append((v, True))` appends a new tuple `(v, True)` to the stack. This increases the size of the stack by one. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
