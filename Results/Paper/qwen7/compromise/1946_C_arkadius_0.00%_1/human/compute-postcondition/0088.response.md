Postcondition: `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by either `1` or `tree.vertices[u].good_components'`, depending on whether `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by `1`. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components'`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.
