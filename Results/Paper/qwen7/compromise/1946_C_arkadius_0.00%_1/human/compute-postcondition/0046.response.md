Output State: The stack contains all tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of vertex `v`, and possibly one tuple `(u, True)` if a child's `remaining_size` met the condition to be marked as such during the loop's execution.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the stack will contain a tuple for each child of vertex `v`. Each tuple will be of the form `(u, False)`, indicating that none of the children have been fully processed or marked as special (i.e., their `remaining_size` did not meet the condition `>= x` to be marked as `(u, True)`). If any child's `remaining_size` met the condition during the loop, there might be one tuple of the form `(u, True)` in the stack, but this is not guaranteed for every child.
