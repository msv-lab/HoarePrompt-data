Postcondition: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components` will contain the sum of `good_components` from all children of vertex `v` plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will be the total `remaining_size` of all children of vertex `v`.**

This means that regardless of whether the condition `postorder` is true or false, after the execution of the if-else block, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will hold the aggregated `good_components` and count of children meeting the size condition, while `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will reflect the combined `remaining_size` of all children of vertex `v`.
