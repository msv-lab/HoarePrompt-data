To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and implementation of the functions provided. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

### Analysis of Functions

1. **func_1**: This function seems to be trying to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each component after a certain threshold `x`. However, its implementation is incomplete and does not seem to correctly handle the post-order traversal and component counting logic.

2. **func_2**: This function is also incomplete and seems to be a recursive function intended to count good components and remaining sizes, but it is not correctly implemented.

3. **func_3**: This function checks if it is possible to have more than `k` good components with a remaining size of at least `x`. It uses `func_1` which is not correctly implemented.

4. **func_4**: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` such that it is possible to remove `k` edges and have each remaining component of size at least `x`. It uses `func_3` which is not correctly implemented.

5. **func_5**: This function reads input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result.

### Issues Identified

- **Incomplete and Incorrect Implementation**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not correctly implemented. They do not properly traverse the tree and calculate the required values.
- **Incorrect Logic**: The logic in `func_3` and `func_4` is flawed because they rely on incorrect implementations of `func_1` and `func_2`.
- **Tree Structure**: The tree structure and operations are not clearly defined, making it difficult to verify the correctness of the functions.

### Conclusion

Given the incomplete and incorrect implementations of the functions, the program cannot be considered correct. Therefore, the answer is:

**False**

The program needs significant corrections and a proper implementation of the tree traversal and component counting logic.
