### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided program based on the problem description, the function summaries, and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap
The task is to find the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).

#### Function Summaries Recap
- **Function 5**: Reads input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to find the maximum \( x \).
- **Function 4**: Uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \) by calling `func_3`.
- **Function 3**: Checks if it's possible to remove \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least \( x \) vertices using `func_1` and `func_2`.
- **Function 1**: Uses post-order traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size for each vertex.
- **Function 2**: Recursively calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Tree Structure and Functions**:
   - The `Tree` class is assumed to have methods like `add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`, and properties like `vertices`. These methods are not provided, but we assume they work correctly.

2. **Function `func_4`**:
   - Binary search implementation is correct. It adjusts the search range based on whether `func_3` returns `True` or `False`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function checks if it's possible to remove \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least \( x \) vertices using `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` uses post-order traversal to accumulate the number of good components and the remaining size for each vertex.
   - `func_2` recursively calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Post-order traversal correctly accumulates the number of good components and the remaining size for each vertex.
   - It updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of the vertices.

5. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Recursive calculation correctly propagates the results up the tree.
   - It updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of the vertices.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the tree is fully connected (i.e., no edges are removed) by checking if `good_components > k` or `good_components == k and remaining_size >= x`.

7. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and constructs the tree.

#### Validation of Original Assessment

The original assessment concluded that the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum \( x \). Given the detailed analysis, the provided program does indeed correctly implement the required functionality.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The provided program is correct according to the problem description and the given function summaries.
