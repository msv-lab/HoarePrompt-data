Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1), filled with zeros; `dp[n-1][0]` is 0; `dp[n-2][0]` is 0; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `cards` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers; `j` is `n-1`; `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][j]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be the same as `dp[i + 1][j]`. Since `i` is `n-3` and `j` is `n-1`, the new value of `dp[i][n-1]` is `dp[i + 1][n-1]`, which is `dp[n-2][n-1]`. However, since `dp` is initialized with zeros and no other values have been set for `dp[n-2][n-1]`, the value remains zero. All other variables remain unchanged.
