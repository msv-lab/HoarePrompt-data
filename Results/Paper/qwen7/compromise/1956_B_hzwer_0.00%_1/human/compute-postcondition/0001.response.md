Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and `cards` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input using `input()`, splits the line into a list of strings, and then maps each string to an integer. This means that the variable `cards` now holds a list of integers, while the variables `t` and `n` retain their initial values.
