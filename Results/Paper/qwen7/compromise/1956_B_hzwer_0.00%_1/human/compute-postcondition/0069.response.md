Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where each element is updated to the maximum value it can take based on the conditions specified in the loop body, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the `cards` list also remains unchanged. Additionally, the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 0.**
