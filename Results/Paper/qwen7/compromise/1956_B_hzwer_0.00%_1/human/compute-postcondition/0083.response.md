Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is `n-2`; `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; the `cards` list remains unchanged.**

This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to the maximum of three possible values based on the indices `i`, `j`, and the conditions specified in the code. The other variables and the `cards` list remain unchanged from their initial states.
