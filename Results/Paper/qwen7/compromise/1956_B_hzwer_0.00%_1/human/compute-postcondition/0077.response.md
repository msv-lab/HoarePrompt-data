Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `j` is `n-1`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where each element is updated to the maximum value it can take based on the conditions specified in the loop body, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the `cards` list also remains unchanged. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, then `dp[1][n-1]` is the maximum value between `dp[2][n-1]` and `dp[3][n-2] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp` remains as it was before the if-else block.**
