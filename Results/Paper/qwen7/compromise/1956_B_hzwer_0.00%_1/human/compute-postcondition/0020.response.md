Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `j` is `n-2`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros except `dp[n-1][0]` is 0 and `dp[n-2][0]` is 0, `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`, `cards` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][j]` for all valid `i` and `j`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i + 1][j]` for the given indices `i` and `j`. Since `i` and `j` are defined as `n-3` and `n-2` respectively, the specific entries `dp[n-3][n-2]` are updated to `dp[n-2][n-2]`. However, without knowing the exact values of `i` and `j` in the context of the entire 2D list, we can only say that `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
