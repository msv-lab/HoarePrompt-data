Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `j` is `n-3`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros except for `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` which are 0, `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`, `cards` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `dp[i][j]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. Given the initial state, `i` and `j` are both `n-3`, and `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros except for the specified positions. After the update, `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`, but the other parts of the precondition remain unchanged.
