Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `j` is `n-2`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros except `dp[n-1][0]` is 0 and `dp[n-2][0]` is 0, `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`, `cards` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**

The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to the maximum of three expressions involving indices shifted by 1 or 2. However, since the exact values of `i` and `j` are `n-3` and `n-2` respectively, and no specific values for `cards` are given, the exact updated value of `dp[i][j]` cannot be determined without knowing the values of `cards`. The other variables remain unchanged.
