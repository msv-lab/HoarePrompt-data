Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `j` is `-1`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `cards` list remains unchanged; `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][j]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i + 1][j]`. Given that initially `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros, and no other changes are made to `dp`, the value of `dp[i][j]` is now the same as `dp[i + 1][j]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
