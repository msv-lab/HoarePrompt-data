Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The input for each test case consists of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 through n appears at most 2 times in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**
