The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it takes an integer \( t \) (number of cases), an even integer \( n \) (length of two input strings), and two strings \( row1 \) and \( row2 \) of length \( n \) consisting of '<' and '>' characters. It then calls another function `func_1` for each test case, passing \( n \), \( row1 \), and \( row2 \) as arguments. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of these calls, one per line, to standard output.
