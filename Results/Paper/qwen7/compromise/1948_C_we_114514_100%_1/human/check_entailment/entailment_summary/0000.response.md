Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if a robot starting at (1,1) can reach (2,n) by moving according to the arrows in a 2xN grid.
2. Function `func_1` is designed to check if the robot can reach (2,n) based on the given rows of arrows. However, the implementation of `func_1` does not fully capture the movement logic required by the problem statement.
3. Specifically, `func_1` checks for invalid pairings of arrows but does not simulate the actual movement of the robot through the grid. It assumes that if any two consecutive arrows in `row1` and `row2` point towards each other, the robot cannot reach (2,n). This is an oversimplification and does not account for the robot's ability to move vertically between rows.
4. Function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
5. Given the problem constraints and the need to simulate the robot's movement accurately, `func_1` needs to properly handle the robot's movement through the grid, which is not done in the current implementation.

Therefore, the current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement and determine if it can reach (2,n).

Correctness: **False**
