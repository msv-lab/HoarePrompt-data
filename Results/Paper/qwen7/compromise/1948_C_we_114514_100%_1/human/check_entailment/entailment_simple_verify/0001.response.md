### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the given program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not handle all possible scenarios and can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the function only checks certain specific conditions and does not ensure that the robot can actually reach the final cell `(2, n)`. Let's re-evaluate the program using the annotated version and the provided examples to confirm the correctness.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates through the first half of the grid (up to `half_n - 1`).
   - It checks if the arrow at position `2*i + 1` in `row1` is `<` (pointing left), and ensures that the next two positions in `row2` do not both point left (`<`). This prevents the robot from getting stuck.
   - It also checks the last column for similar conditions.
   - If any of these conditions fail, it returns `'No'`. Otherwise, it returns `'Yes'`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Prints the results for all test cases.

#### Example Verification

Let's re-examine the provided examples with the annotated version:

1. **First Example**:
   - `n = 4`
   - `row1 = ">><<"`
   - `row2 = ">>><"`
   - The function correctly identifies that the robot can reach `(2, 4)`.

2. **Second Example**:
   - `n = 2`
   - `row1 = "><"`
   - `row2 = "><"`
   - The function correctly identifies that the robot can reach `(2, 2)`.

3. **Third Example**:
   - `n = 4`
   - `row1 = ">>><"`
   - `row2 = ">><<"`
   - The function incorrectly identifies that the robot can reach `(2, 4)`, but the correct path is blocked. The robot gets stuck at `(2, 3)`.

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - `n = 6`
   - `row1 = ">><<><"`
   - `row2 = "><>>><"`
   - The function correctly identifies that the robot can reach `(2, 6)`.

From the above examples, we can see that the function `func_1` fails to correctly identify the cases where the robot gets stuck or cannot reach the final cell `(2, n)`. The function only checks certain specific conditions and does not ensure that the robot can actually progress to the final cell.

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` does not correctly handle all possible scenarios and can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
