Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even, row1 and row2 are strings consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either '<' or '>', and the code reads input and processes each test case.**

The given code is a comment block that describes the process of reading input and processing each test case. It does not modify any variables or perform any operations that would change the values of `t`, `n`, `row1`, or `row2`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions. The only change is that the code now includes the logic to read input and process each test case, which is noted in the output state.
