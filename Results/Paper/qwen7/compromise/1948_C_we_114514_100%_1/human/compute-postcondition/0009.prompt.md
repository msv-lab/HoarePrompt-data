You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, row1 is a string consisting of exactly n characters '<' and/or '>', and row2 is a string consisting of exactly n characters '<' and/or '>'. Additionally, n is even, and there are no arrows pointing outside the grid.
def func_1(n, row1, row2):
    """
    判断机器人是否能够从 (1,1) 到达 (2,n)。
    """
    half_n = n // 2
    for i in range(half_n - 1):
        if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'):
            return 'No'
        
    #State: The function returns 'No' if any condition inside the loop is met; otherwise, it does not return anything.
    if (row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<') :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State: The function does not return 'No', and either row1[n - 1] is not '<' or row2[n - 2] is not '<'
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters n, row1, and row2. It returns 'Yes' if it's possible to pair each character in row1 with a corresponding character in row2 without any two paired characters pointing at each other; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'No'

Case_2: The program returns 'Yes'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
