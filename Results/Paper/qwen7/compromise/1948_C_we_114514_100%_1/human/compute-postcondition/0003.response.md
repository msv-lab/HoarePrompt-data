Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only object here is `_`, but since `_` is just a placeholder and doesn't hold any specific value, we don't need to adjust its state.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

3. **State before the loop**: According to the given information, `t` is an integer equal to the input integer. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than 0.

**State:**
**`t` must be greater than 0**
