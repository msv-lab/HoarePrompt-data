Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even, `row1` and `row2` are strings consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial conditions for `n`, `row1`, and `row2` remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` is still an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even, and `row1` and `row2` are still strings consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'.
