Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the arrays `l` and `r` such that the XOR of their elements are equal. Specifically, the program attempts to construct `l` and `r` by directly selecting elements from the input array `a`, but this approach does not guarantee that the XOR values of `l` and `r` will be equal. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
4 2
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

The expected output would be two arrays `l` and `r` such that the XOR of their elements are equal. However, the program might output something like:
```
1 2
1 2
```

This is incorrect because the XOR of `[1, 2]` is `3`, but the XOR of `[1, 2]` is also `3`, which is correct, but the program does not guarantee that it will always find such pairs. In fact, the program logic is flawed because it does not ensure that the XOR values of `l` and `r` are equal for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
