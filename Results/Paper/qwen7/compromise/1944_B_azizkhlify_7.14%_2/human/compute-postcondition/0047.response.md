Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, and `ul` is increased by 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where `ul` was being modified. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `ul` is increased by 2 according to the initial conditions.
