Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `l[a[1] - 1]` remains equal to 2.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

From the initial state, we know that `i` is 2. Therefore, `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`.

However, the value of `a[2]` is not explicitly given. Since no other information about the list `a` is provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[2]`. But we do know that the statement will print `a[2]` twice, separated by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Thus, the output will be a repeated value of `a[2]`.

Output: **a[2] a[2]**
