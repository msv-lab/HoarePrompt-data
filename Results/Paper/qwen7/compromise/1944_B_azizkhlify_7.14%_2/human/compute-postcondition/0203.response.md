Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 10
   - `n` is at least 9
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1
   - `re` is 1
   - `res` is a list with the element `a[10]` appended

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `10 + 1 = 11`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` changes to 11.
   - `n` remains at least 9 (since it is not modified).

6. **Postconditions**:
   - The postconditions for the loop should still hold true for the next iteration. Specifically, `l[a[i] - 1]` being 1 and `re` being 1 are conditions that depend on the values of `a[i]` and `re`, respectively. These conditions will be checked again in the next iteration, but they do not change the loop control variables `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 11, `n` is at least 9**
