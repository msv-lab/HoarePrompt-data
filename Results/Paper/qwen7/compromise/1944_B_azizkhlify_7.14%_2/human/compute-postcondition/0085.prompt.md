Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, `n` is an integer greater than 0, and `ul` is increased by 2 for each iteration where `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, up to a maximum of `k * 2`. Since the if condition is true, `k` is non-zero.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `n-2`, `re` is incremented by 1, `res` contains `a[i]`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1. If `re` equals `k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `re` does not equal `k`, then `i` remains `n-2`, `re` and `res` retain their original values, and `l[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n-2`, `re` is `re + 2`, `res` contains `a[n-1]` and `a[i]`, and `l[a[n-1] - 1]` equals 1. If `re` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n-2`, `re` is incremented by 1, `res` contains `a[n-1]`, `a[n-2]`, and `a[n-1]`, and `l[a[n-1] - 1]` equals 1, and if `re` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
