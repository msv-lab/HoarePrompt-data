Postcondition: **`i` is 9, `n` is greater than or equal to 9, `l[a[8] - 1]` is either 2 or remains unchanged, `ul` is the original value of `ul` plus 6, `r[a[3] - 1]` is incremented by 3, `r[a[5] - 1]` is incremented by 2, `r[a[6] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, and since `(k)` is true, `k` is non-zero**
