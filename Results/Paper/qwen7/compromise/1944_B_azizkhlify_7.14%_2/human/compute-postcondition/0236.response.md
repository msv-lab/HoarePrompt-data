Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `n` to `2 * n`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < 2 * n`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `res` must have at least one element.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is 2 more than its previous value.
   - If `r[a[i] - 1]` is not 2, the values of `i`, `res`, `n`, and `ur` remain unchanged from their preconditions, and `ul` equals `ur`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n` and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - The condition `i < 2 * n` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.
   - Given that `i` was `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `n + 1 < 2 * n` must be true.

6. **Adjust the Other Variables**:
   - `res` must still have at least one element.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `ur` will be updated based on the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` (where `i` is now `n + 1`).
   - `ul` will equal `ur`.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `res` must have at least one element.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `ur` is updated based on the value of `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`.
- `ul` equals `ur`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `res` must have at least one element, `n` is a non-negative integer, and if `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is 2 more than its previous value. If `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is not 2, the values of `i`, `res`, `n`, and `ur` remain unchanged from their preconditions, and `ul` equals `ur`.**
