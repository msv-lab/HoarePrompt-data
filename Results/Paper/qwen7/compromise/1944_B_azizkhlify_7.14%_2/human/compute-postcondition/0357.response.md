Output State: **`i` is `n`, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `ur` is set to 2. The value of `ul` is equal to `ur`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement where the conditions for setting `ur` and `ul` were being checked. The values of `i`, `n`, `r[a[i] - 1]`, `ur`, and `ul` remain unchanged except that the execution is terminated early due to the `break`.
