Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `res` is a list that contains elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, up to a maximum of `k` elements if `k` is non-zero.
   - If `k` is zero, `res` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is an element of `res`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(i, end=' ')
   ```

Given this, let's analyze what will happen:

- Since `i` is an element of `res`, it means `i` is one of the elements that satisfy the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` and is included in the list `res`.
- The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Therefore, the output will be the value of `i` followed by a space.

Output: **i (where i is an element of res)**
