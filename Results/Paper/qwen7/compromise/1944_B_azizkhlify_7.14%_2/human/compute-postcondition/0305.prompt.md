Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` is `2 * n`, `n` is a positive integer, and each element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` has been incremented by 1 for every `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.

This means that starting from `i = n`, the loop increments the value at the position `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` for each `i` up to `2 * n - 1`. Since the loop runs from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`, it will increment the corresponding elements in `r` exactly `n` times. Therefore, the final state of `r` will have each element at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 2 or unchanged. If `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `ul` is set to 2. Otherwise, `ul` retains its original value. The condition `ul` is equal to `k * 2` is also satisfied, leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 2 or has not been checked, depending on the condition being true or false. If the condition `ul == k * 2` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, and `l[a[2] - 1]` is either 2 or has not been checked. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ul` does not equal `k * 2`, `ul` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
