Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is a positive integer, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 2 if it was equal to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `i` or `n`, nor does it affect the condition for setting `r[a[i] - 1]` to 2. It simply breaks out of the loop or if statement it is inside.
