Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n, 2 * n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i`, `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `res` must have at least one element
   - `n` is a non-negative integer
   - `ur` is 2 more than its previous value
   - `ul` equals `ur`
   - The most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently `n + 1`, the loop will continue if `n + 1 < 2 * n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n + 1` and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain the same (since it is not modified within the loop head), and `2 * n` remains unchanged.

5. **Consider the other variables**:
   - `res` must still have at least one element.
   - `ur` is 2 more than its previous value, and `ul` equals `ur`. These values are not directly affected by the loop, so they remain the same.
   - The fact that the most internal loop or if statement is broken out does not affect the loop head variables.

Based on the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `n + 2`
- `res` must have at least one element
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `ur` is 2 more than its previous value
- `ul` equals `ur`

So, the final state is:

**State: `i` is `n + 2`, `res` must have at least one element, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ur` is 2 more than its previous value, and `ul` equals `ur`**
