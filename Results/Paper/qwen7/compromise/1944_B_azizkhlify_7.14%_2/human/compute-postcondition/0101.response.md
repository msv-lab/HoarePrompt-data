Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `r` is a list where the element at index `a[i] - 1` is equal to 2, `ur` is `ur + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and the condition of list `r` remain unchanged from the initial state.
