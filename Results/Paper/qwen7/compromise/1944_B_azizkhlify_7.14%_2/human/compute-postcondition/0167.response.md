Output State: **`i` is 7, `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 2 or remains unchanged, `ul` retains its original value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block without changing the values of `i`, `l[a[i] - 1]`, or `ul`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain the same as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
