Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `res`. The final state will be determined by the last element printed by the loop. The values of `ul` and `ur` are not equal.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `res` must have at least one element, `n` is a non-negative integer, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is 2 more than its previous value. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is not 2, the values of `i`, `res`, `n`, and `ur` remain unchanged from their preconditions, and `ul` equals `ur`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n + 1`, `res` must have at least one element, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ur` is 2 more than its previous value, and `ul` equals `ur`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n + 2`, `res` must have at least one element, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ur` is 2 more than its previous value, `ul` equals `ur`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. Since the condition `ul == ur` is checked and the postcondition remains unchanged in both cases (whether the condition is true or false), the overall postcondition is the same as the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
