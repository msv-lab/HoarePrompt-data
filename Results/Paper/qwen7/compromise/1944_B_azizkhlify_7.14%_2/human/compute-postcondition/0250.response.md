Postcondition: **`i` is `n + 2`, `res` must have at least one element, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ur` is 2 more than its previous value, `ul` equals `ur`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. Since the condition `ul == ur` is checked and the postcondition remains unchanged in both cases (whether the condition is true or false), the overall postcondition is the same as the precondition.**
