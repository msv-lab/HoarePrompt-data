Output State: **`i` is 10, `n` is at least 9, `re` is 1, `res` is a list with the element `a[10]` appended.**

Explanation: The code `res.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `res`. Given that `i` is 10, `a[10]` is appended to `res`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `re`) remain unchanged.
