Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n, 2 * n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `res` must have at least one element.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `ur` is 2 more than its previous value.
   - `ul` equals `ur`.
   - The most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < 2 * n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to `n + 2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the range and does not change within the loop.
   - The other variables (`res`, `ur`, `ul`) are not directly affected by the loop itself, so their states remain the same unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` becomes `n + 2`.
   - `res` still must have at least one element.
   - `n` remains a non-negative integer.
   - `ur` remains 2 more than its previous value.
   - `ul` still equals `ur`.
   - The most internal loop or if statement is still broken out.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `res` must have at least one element, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ur` is 2 more than its previous value, `ul` equals `ur`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**
