Output State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `r[a[3] - 1]` is `r[a[3] - 1] + 1`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is `r[a[5] - 1] + 1**.

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` by 1. Given that `i` is 5, this translates to `r[a[5] - 1] += 1`. The value of `r[a[3] - 1]` remains unchanged as it was not directly affected by the code. The other variables (`i`, `n`) remain in their initial states.
