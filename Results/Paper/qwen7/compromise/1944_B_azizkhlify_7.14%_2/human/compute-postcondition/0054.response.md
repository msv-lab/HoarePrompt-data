Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Check the given conditions**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.
   - Given `i` is initially `n-1`, the loop will run once (since `n-1 < n`).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will execute exactly once, `i` will be decremented from `n-1` to `n-2` after the first iteration.
   - Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be `n-1` and `n` should be greater than 0.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer greater than 0**
