Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 0.
- Therefore, `a[i]` is `a[0]`.

We also know that `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2. This means:
- `l[a[0] - 1] = 2`.

However, the value of `a[0]` itself is not explicitly given, but it does not affect the output of the print statement directly. The print statement will print `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Given that `a[i]` is `a[0]`, and since no other information about `a[0]` is provided, we can only say that `a[0]` is some value that makes `l[a[0] - 1] = 2` true. But for the purpose of the print statement, we only need to know that `a[0]` is the value that satisfies this condition.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- `a[0]` (which is some value that makes `l[a[0] - 1] = 2`)
- `a[0]` again
- Followed by a space

Output: **a[0] a[0]**
