Output State: **The loop will continue to print each element in `res` until `res` is empty.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, it will have printed every element in the list `res`. The loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in `res`. Once `res` becomes empty, the loop terminates. Therefore, the final output state is that all elements in `res` have been printed, and `res` itself is now an empty list.
