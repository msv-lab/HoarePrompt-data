Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `r`, `a`, `ur`, and `ul` remain the same as at the end of the previous iteration, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the initial conditions state that `i` is `n + 2`, `r`, `a`, `ur`, and `ul` remain unchanged from the end of the previous iteration, and there's no further action taken within the scope of the `break` statement, these variables retain their previous values. The only change is that the loop or conditional block is exited.
