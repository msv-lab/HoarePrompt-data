Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `range(n, 2 * n)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `r`, `a`, `ur`, and `ul` remain the same as at the end of the previous iteration.
   - If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` was `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `n + 2`.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < 2 * n`.
   - Given that `i` is now `n + 2`, the condition `i < 2 * n` will still hold true as long as `n + 2 < 2 * n`.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `n + 2`.
   - `r`, `a`, `ur`, and `ul` will remain unchanged.
   - The postcondition remains the same: if `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `r`, `a`, `ur`, and `ul` remain the same as at the end of the previous iteration, and if `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**.
