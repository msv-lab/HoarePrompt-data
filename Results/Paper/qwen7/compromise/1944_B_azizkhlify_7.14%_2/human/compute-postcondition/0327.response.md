Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is a list where if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, `res` is increased by the element `a[i]`. If `l[a[i] - 1]` does not equal 1, `res` remains unchanged.
   - `l` is a list of integers.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - The loop breaks if `res == k`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was increased by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.
   - `res` will either remain the same or increase by `a[i]` depending on the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `res` could either remain the same or increase by `a[i]` based on the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`res` is a list where if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, `res` is increased by the element `a[i]` (where `i` is now `i + 1`). If `l[a[i] - 1]` does not equal 1, `res` remains unchanged. `l` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `res == k`, the loop or statement is broken.** 

However, to provide a concrete example, let's assume some values for clarity:

- Suppose at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2, `n` was 5, `res` was `[3, 5]`, `l` was `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`, and `a` was `[3, 4, 2]`.
- For `i = 2`, `a[2] = 2`, and `l[a[2] - 1] = l[1] = 0`, so `res` remains `[3, 5]`.
- For the next iteration, `i` becomes `3`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`res` is `[3, 5]`, `l` is `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`, `a` is `[3, 4, 2]`, `i` is `3`, and `n` is `5`.**
