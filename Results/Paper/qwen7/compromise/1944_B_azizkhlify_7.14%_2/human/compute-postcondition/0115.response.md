Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 2 if it was equal to 2. If the condition `ul == ur` is true, `i` is incremented by 1 and the loop or statement is exited. If the condition `ul == ur` is false, there is no change in the values of `i`, `n`, and `r[a[i] - 1]`.
