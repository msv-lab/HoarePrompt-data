Postcondition: `i` is `n + 2`, `res` must have at least one element, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ur` is 2 more than its previous value, `ul` equals `ur`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition within the if condition.
