Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is a positive integer
- `l[a[2] - 1]` is either 2 or has not been checked, depending on the condition being true or false

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `i` is explicitly given as 2.
2. We need to find the value of `a[i]`, which is `a[2]`.
3. Since `a` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its contents directly from the given information. However, we know that `a[2]` exists and we need to print it twice.

The `print` statement will print the value of `a[2]` twice, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Output: **a[2] a[2]**
