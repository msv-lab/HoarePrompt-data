Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n, 2 * n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 2 if it was equal to 2.
   - The condition `ul == ur` is checked within the loop.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented from its current value of `n + 1` to `n + 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be `n + 2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - The condition `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 2 if it was equal to 2, but since `i` is changing, this condition will be checked again with the new value of `i`.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `i` is now `n + 2`.
   - `n` is still a positive integer.
   - The condition `r[a[i] - 1]` will be checked with `i = n + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is a positive integer, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 2 if it was equal to 2.**
