Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n integers such that 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `nums`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
