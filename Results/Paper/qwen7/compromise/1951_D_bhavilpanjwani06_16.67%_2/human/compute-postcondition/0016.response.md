Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `n` is greater than `k`. The overall postcondition states that either the condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` is satisfied, in which case the original constraints hold, or the condition `(k - 1 ≥ n - k + 1)` is satisfied, also maintaining the original constraints.
