Output: **YES**

Explanation: The initial state provides us with the conditions and constraints for the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`. However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The statement simply prints the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`. Therefore, the output will be the string `'YES'`.
