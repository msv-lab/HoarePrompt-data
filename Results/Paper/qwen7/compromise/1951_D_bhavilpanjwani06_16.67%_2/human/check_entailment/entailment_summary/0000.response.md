Reasoning:
- The problem requires setting up at most 60 stalls with specific prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
- The provided program only handles three specific cases:
  1. When `n < k`, it correctly prints "NO".
  2. When `n == k`, it prints "YES", `1`, and `n`.
  3. When `n > k` and `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, it prints "YES", `2`, `n - k + 1`, and `1`.

However, these conditions do not cover all possible scenarios required by the problem statement. Specifically:
- The program does not handle cases where more than two stalls are needed.
- The program does not consider the possibility of setting up more than 60 stalls, which is allowed according to the problem constraints.
- The logic for determining the prices of the stalls is incomplete and does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels in all possible scenarios.

Given these limitations, the provided program cannot correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
