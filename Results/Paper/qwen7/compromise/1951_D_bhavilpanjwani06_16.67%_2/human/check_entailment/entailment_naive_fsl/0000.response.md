Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider scenarios where more than two stalls might be needed to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `255 8`
- Expected Output: `YES` followed by the number of stalls and their respective prices.

The program attempts to handle cases where `n < k`, `n == k`, and a specific case where `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. However, it does not account for the general case where more than two stalls are required. For instance, in the example given, the program would incorrectly output `NO` because it only considers the case where the difference between `n` and `k` allows for exactly two stalls, which is not always true.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to dynamically adjust the number of stalls and their prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, considering all possible values of `n` and `k`.
