The function processes three integers: `t`, `n`, and `k`. It checks if `t` is within the range 1 to 1000, and if `n` and `k` are positive integers up to \(10^{18}\). Based on the relationships between `n` and `k`, it prints either "YES" or "NO". If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO". If `n` equals `k`, it prints "YES", `1`, and `n`. If `n` is greater than `k` and `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)`, it prints "YES", `2`, `n - k + 1`, and `1`. Otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value but modifies the output through printing.
