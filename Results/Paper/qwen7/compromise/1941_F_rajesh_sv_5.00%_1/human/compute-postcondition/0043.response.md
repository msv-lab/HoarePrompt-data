Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `right - f[0]` - 1, `l` must be less than `h`.**

Explanation: The variable `mid` is calculated using the formula `l + (h - l) // 2`, which is a common way to find the middle index between `l` and `h`. The values of `h` and `l` remain unchanged from their initial conditions, and the condition that `l` must be less than `h` still holds true.
