Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `l` and `h` will define the boundaries of the search range where the optimal solution is found, `ans` will contain the best result obtained across all iterations, `f` will be the last element in `F` processed by the loop, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` will reflect the sums `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` for the last valid midpoint `mid`, and `left` and `right` will retain their values from the final iteration. `ans` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)` after processing the last element in `F`.
