Output State: **`l` is `mid + 1`, `h` must be greater than `l`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

Explanation: The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. The other variables (`h`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. The condition that `l` must be less than `h` still holds true, and the expressions for `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain valid based on their definitions.
