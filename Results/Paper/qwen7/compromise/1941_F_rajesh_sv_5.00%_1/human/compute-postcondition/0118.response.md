Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` is `mid + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, which means `l` now holds the value of `mid + 1`. The values of `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states.
