Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` is an integer less than `h`, and `h` must be greater than `l`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the midpoint `mid` between `l` and `h` using the formula `l + (h - l) // 2`. This formula ensures that `mid` is an integer and is the average of `l` and `h` rounded down. The values of `l` and `h` remain unchanged from their initial state, which is that `l` is an integer less than `h`, and `h` is greater than `l`.
