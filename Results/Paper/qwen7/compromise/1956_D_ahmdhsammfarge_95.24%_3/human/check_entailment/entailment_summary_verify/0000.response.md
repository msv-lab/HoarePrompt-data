### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to maximize the sum of the array elements by repeatedly choosing a subarray and setting all elements in that subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of that subarray.
- The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the set.
- The operations can be performed up to \(5 \times 10^5\) times.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to find the subarray with the maximum sum plus the square of its length.
   - The logic inside the function does not align with the problem requirements. It calculates a sum based on subarrays but does not compute the MEX and update the subarray accordingly.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function seems to be part of a recursive approach to generate operations.
   - However, it is not clear how it relates to the MEX computation or updating the array.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function is supposed to replace the subarray from index `r` to `l` with a list of `r - l + 1` elements, each equal to `r - l + 1`.
   - The function also appends certain operations to the `ops` list and calls `func_2`.
   - The key issue here is that it sets the subarray to a fixed value (`r - l + 1`) instead of the MEX value of the subarray.

#### Correct Solution Outline:
- To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
  1. Compute the MEX for each subarray.
  2. Update the subarray with the MEX value.
  3. Repeat until no further updates can be made.

Given the provided functions, none of them correctly implement the MEX computation or the required updates to the array. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic required to compute the MEX and update the array as specified in the problem description.
