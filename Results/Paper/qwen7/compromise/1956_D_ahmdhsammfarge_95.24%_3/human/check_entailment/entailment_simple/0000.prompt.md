Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Output

    1 1
    1 1
    
Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

# Annotated Program:
input()
lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
ops = []
(r, l) = func_1(lst)
while r != l:
    lst = func_3(r, l, lst, ops)
    (r, l) = func_1(lst)
try:
    while True:
        i = lst.index(0) + 1
        lst[i - 1] = 1
        ops.append([i, i])
except ValueError:
    pass
print(sum(lst), len(ops))
for r in ops:
    print(*r)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers with length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18), where n is the length of the input array a.
def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                r, l = [i, j]
                over_sum = sm
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 2, `j` is 6, `r` is 2, `l` is 5, `over_sum` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` remains 2 because the loop increments `j` but does not change `i`. The value of `j` becomes 6 (or greater) since the loop continues until `j` is no longer less than the length of `lst`. The value of `r` remains 2 because it was only updated to 4 once, and subsequent updates did not make `sm` greater than `over_sum`. The value of `l` is updated to 5 because `j` reaches a point where further iterations do not find a larger `sm`. The value of `over_sum` remains `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9` because no new sum `sm` was found that exceeded this value during the loop iterations.
    return r, l
    #The program returns r which is 2 and l which is 5.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: r is an integer such that 0 <= r < n, l is an integer such that 0 <= l < n, and ops is a list that will store the operations performed.

    if (r == l) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
        #The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code snippet.
    #State: `r` is an integer such that 0 <= r < n, `l` is an integer such that 0 <= l < n, and `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed. The values of `r` and `l` are not equal.
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of non-negative integers of length n, r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(lst), and ops is a list that will store the operations performed.
def func_3(r, l, lst, ops):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if (min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    #State: Postcondition: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and `ops` is a list containing `[[r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, l + 1]]`. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, then the function does not change the list `lst` or the list `ops`. Since there is no else part, the list `lst` and `ops` remain unchanged regardless of the condition.
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst
    #The program returns a list `lst` where the sublist from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is replaced by a list of `n` elements, each element being equal to `n`.
