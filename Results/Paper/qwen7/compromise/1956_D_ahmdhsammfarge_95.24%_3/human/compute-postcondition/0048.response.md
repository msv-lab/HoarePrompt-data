Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is greater than 3, `r` is 2, `l` is 3, `over_sum` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`**

Explanation: The code `r, l = [i, j]` unpacks the list `[i, j]` into the variables `r` and `l`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is greater than 3, `r` will be assigned the value of `i`, which is 2, and `l` will be assigned the value of `j`. The values of `over_sum` and `sm` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.
