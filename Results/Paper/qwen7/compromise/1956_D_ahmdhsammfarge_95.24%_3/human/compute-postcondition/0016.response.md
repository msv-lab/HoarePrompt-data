Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `i`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `j` is 2
   - `sm` is 3
   - `r` is 0
   - `l` is 2
   - `over_sum` is 3

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` (which is 1) up to `len(lst)`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `len(lst)`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
   - To allow the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - Since `i` is fixed at 0, the new value of `j` should be 3 to satisfy the condition `j < len(lst)`.

5. **Other variables remain unchanged**:
   - `sm`, `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` do not change based on the loop head variables.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is 3, `r` is 0, `l` is 2, `over_sum` is 3**
