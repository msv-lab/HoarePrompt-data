Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `j` and the condition `range(i + 1, len(lst))`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is greater than 4.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `i + 1` to `len(lst) - 1`. Given that `i` is 2, the loop will continue as long as `j` is between 3 and `len(lst) - 1`.

4. **Check the Current Value of `j`**: Since `j` is greater than 4, it means `j` could be any value from 5 up to `len(lst) - 1`.

5. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `j`). Therefore, `j` will become `j + 1`.

6. **Maintain Other States**: The other variables (`i`, `r`, `l`, `over_sum`, and `sm`) should remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`i` is 2, `j` is greater than 5, `r` is 4, `l` is 2, `over_sum` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`**
