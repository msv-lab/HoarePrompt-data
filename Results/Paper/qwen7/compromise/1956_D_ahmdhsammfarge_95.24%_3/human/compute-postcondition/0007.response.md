Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, `r` is `r + 1`, `l` is `l + 1`, and `ops` is a list containing `[[r + 1, r + 1], [r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, l + 1]]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list. Since `r` is `r + 1` and `l` is `l + 1`, the new element appended to `ops` is `[r + 1, l + 1]`. This means `ops` now contains three elements: `[[r + 1, r + 1], [r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, l + 1]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
