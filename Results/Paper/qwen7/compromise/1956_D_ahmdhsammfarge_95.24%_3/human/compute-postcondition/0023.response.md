Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `i` as the variable iterating over the range of `len(lst)`. Therefore, the only variable that can be adjusted is `i`.

2. **Determine the Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(lst)`. Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 1.

4. **Adjust the States**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which will now be 1. The other variables (`j`, `r`, `l`, and `over_sum`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is len(lst) - 1, `r` is 0, `l` is len(lst) - 1, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` calculated during the loop executions.**
