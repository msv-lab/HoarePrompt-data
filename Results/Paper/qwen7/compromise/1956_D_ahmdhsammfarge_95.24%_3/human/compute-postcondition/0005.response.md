Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and `ops` is a list containing `[[r + 1, r + 1], [r + 1, l + 1]]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `[r + 1, r + 1]` to the list `ops`. Since the original value of `ops` was `[[r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, l + 1]]`, after appending, `ops` becomes `[[r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, r + 1]]`. The list `lst` remains unchanged.
