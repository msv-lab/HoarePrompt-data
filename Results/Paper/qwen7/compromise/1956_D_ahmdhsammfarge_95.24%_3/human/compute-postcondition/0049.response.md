Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is greater than 3, `r` is 2, `l` is 3, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1), `sm` is `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)**

Explanation: The line `over_sum = sm` simply assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Since `sm` is defined as `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, `over_sum` now holds the same value. The values of other variables (`i`, `j`, `r`, `l`) remain unchanged.
