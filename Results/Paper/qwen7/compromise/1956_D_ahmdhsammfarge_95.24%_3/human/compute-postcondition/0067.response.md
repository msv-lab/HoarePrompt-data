Output State: **The program returns r which is 2 and l which is 5.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `r` remains 2 because it was only updated to 4 once, and subsequent updates did not make `sm` greater than `over_sum`. The value of `l` is updated to 5 because `j` reaches a point where further iterations do not find a larger `sm`.
