Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function correctly calculates the sum of the product of each friendship value (`f`) and the combination formula \( k \times (k + 1) // 2 \), modulo `MOD`, for all pairs of friends.
   - The combination formula \( k \times (k + 1) // 2 \) represents the number of ways to pick a pair from `k` excursions, which is correct for calculating the expected increase in friendship value.
   - The function iterates over all pairs of friends and adds the result of \( f \times (k \times (k + 1) // 2) \) to `result`, then returns the final result modulo `MOD`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, the number of excursions `k`, and the list of friendships.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result for each test case.
   - The function ensures that the input and output handling is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Overall Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.
   - It handles multiple test cases and processes each test case appropriately.
   - The calculations within `func_1` are correct and follow the problem's requirements.
   - The overall structure and flow of the program match the problem description.

Given the analysis above, the program is correct in terms of both logic and implementation.

Correctness: **True**
