Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for k excursions, considering that the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 whenever they are chosen for an excursion.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function computes the sum of the product of each friendship value (f) and the combination formula \( k \times (k + 1) // 2 \), modulo a constant (MOD), for all pairs of friends. This formula accounts for the expected increase in friendship value over k excursions.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the necessary inputs (n, m, k, and the list of friendships), calls `func_1` with these inputs, and prints the result. The logic here seems to correctly implement the solution strategy described in the problem statement.

Given the execution summaries and the logical structure of the code, the implementation appears to correctly address the problem requirements. Each test case is processed independently, and the expected value calculation is performed accurately using the provided formula.

Correctness: **True**
