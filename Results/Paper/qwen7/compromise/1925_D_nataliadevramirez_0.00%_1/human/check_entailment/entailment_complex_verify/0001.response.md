### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key components and logic of the program. Let's break down the analysis again to ensure accuracy and completeness.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The result must be computed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes parameters \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and a list of friendships.
   - It iterates over each friendship and calculates the contribution to the result using the formula \( f \times \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \).
   - This formula is derived from the fact that each pair of friends has an equal probability of being chosen in each excursion, and the expected number of times a pair will be chosen over \( k \) excursions is \( \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \).
   - The result is taken modulo \( MOD \) (which is \( 10^9 + 7 \)).

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
   - It then reads the list of friendships.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Formula Used:**
   - The formula \( \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \) is indeed the correct expected number of times a friendship value will increase over \( k \) excursions.
   - This formula assumes equiprobable and independent choices, which matches the problem statement.

2. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Using modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) is correct as specified in the problem statement.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where there are no friendships (as seen in the first test case).
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases.

4. **Implementation:**
   - The implementation follows the logic correctly without any apparent errors.
   - The code handles the input and output as required.

### Conclusion:

After re-evaluating the program and the original assessment, we confirm that the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**

The program is correct.
