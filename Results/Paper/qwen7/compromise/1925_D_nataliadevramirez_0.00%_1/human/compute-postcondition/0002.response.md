Output State: **After executing the loop for `t` times, the output state will consist of `t` results generated by the function `func_1`. Each result corresponds to the output of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` for each iteration, where `n` is the number of children, `m` is the number of pairs of friends, `k` is the number of excursions, and `friendships` is a list of friend pairs with their values. The results are printed after each iteration.**
