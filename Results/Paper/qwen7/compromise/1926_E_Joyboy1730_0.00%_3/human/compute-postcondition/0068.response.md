Output State: **`L` must contain at least one element, `pow` is 2, `k` is `k` - `tot`, `m` is 0, `n` is 0, and `tot` is equal to `tot` plus the first element of `L`.**

Explanation: The code multiplies `pow` by 2, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables (`k`, `m`, `n`, and `tot`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `L` must contain at least one element is still valid.
