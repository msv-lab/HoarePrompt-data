Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `pow` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `m` is (n + 1) // 2, `tot` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `m` to `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `n` is assumed to be greater than 2 as per the initial condition.
