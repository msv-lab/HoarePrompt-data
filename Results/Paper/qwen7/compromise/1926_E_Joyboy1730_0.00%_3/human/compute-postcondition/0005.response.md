Output State: **`t` must be an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is equal to \((n + 1) // 2\)**.

This means that the value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
