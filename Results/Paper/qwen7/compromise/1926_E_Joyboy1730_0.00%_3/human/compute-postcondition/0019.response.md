Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `L` is a non-empty list.
- `m` is equal to 1.
- `tot` is less than `k`.
- `k` is less than or equal to `tot` plus the first element of `L`.
- `pow` is 1.

The `print` statement is `print(pow * (2 * k - 1))`.

Given that `pow` is explicitly stated to be 1, we can directly substitute this value into the expression.

So, the expression becomes:
\[ 1 \times (2 \times k - 1) = 2k - 1 \]

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the value of \(2k - 1\).

Output: **2k - 1**
