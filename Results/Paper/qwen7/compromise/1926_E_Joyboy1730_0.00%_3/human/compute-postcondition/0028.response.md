Based on the initial state provided:

- `pow` is multiplied by 2, so `pow = 2 * pow_initial` where `pow_initial` is the original value of `pow` before it was multiplied.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is an input integer minus `tot`, but since `tot` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `k`. However, we know `k = input_integer - tot`.
- `L` is a non-empty list with at least one element, but its contents are not specified.
- `m` is equal to 1.

The expression inside the `print` statement is `pow * (2 * k - 1)`. Given the values of the variables:

- `pow` is `2 * pow_initial`.
- `k` is `input_integer - tot`.

So, the expression becomes:

\[ \text{print}(\text{pow\_initial} \times 2 \times (\text{input\_integer} - \text{tot}) - \text{pow\_initial}) \]

Simplifying this:

\[ \text{print}(2 \times \text{pow\_initial} \times (\text{input\_integer} - \text{tot}) - \text{pow\_initial}) \]

This simplifies further to:

\[ \text{print}(\text{pow\_initial} \times (2 \times (\text{input\_integer} - \text{tot}) - 1)) \]

Since `pow` is `2 * pow_initial`, we can substitute back:

\[ \text{print(pow)} \]

Therefore, the output will be the value of `pow`.

Output: **pow (where pow is 2 * pow_initial)**
