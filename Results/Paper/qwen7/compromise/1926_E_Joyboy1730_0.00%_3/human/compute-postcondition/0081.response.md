Postcondition: `L` must contain at least one element, `pow` is 4, `k` is decreased by the new value of `tot`, `m` and `n` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`. If the condition `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a` is not met, the program continues without any changes to `k`, `m`, and `n`.
