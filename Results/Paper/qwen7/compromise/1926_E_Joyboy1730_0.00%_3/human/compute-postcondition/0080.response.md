Postcondition: `L` must contain at least one element, `pow` is 4, `k` is decreased by the new value of `tot`, `m` and `n` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`; otherwise, the conditions remain as they were before the if-else block.
