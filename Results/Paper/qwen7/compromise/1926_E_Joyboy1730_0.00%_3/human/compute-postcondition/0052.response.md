Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `pow` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `m` is (n + 1) // 2, `tot` is 0, and n is n - (n + 1) // 2.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `(n + 1) // 2` from it. Since `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` becomes `n - m`. All other variables remain unchanged.
