Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is equal to \((0 + 1) // 2\), `tot` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `tot` to 0. The loop described in the initial state reduces `n` by `m` where `m = (n + 1) // 2` until `n` becomes 0. Since `n` is already 0 before the loop starts, the loop does not execute, and `n` remains 0. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `L`, and `m`) are not affected by the code, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
