### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - Bob starts with a rectangle of dimensions \(a \times b\).
   - He cuts this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.
   - He then tries to rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle.
   - Two rectangles are considered the same if they have the same dimensions, regardless of their orientation.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because cutting an odd-sized rectangle results in two smaller odd-sized rectangles, and no combination of these can form a new rectangle without repeating the original dimensions.

3. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.
     - If either is even, it prints 'Yes'.
     - If both are odd, it prints 'No'.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies whether a new rectangle can be formed based on the parity (odd/even nature) of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The program handles all test cases as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given dimensions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
