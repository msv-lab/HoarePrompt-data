### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if Bob can transform a given rectangle \(a \times b\) into another rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always form another rectangle. This is because:
   - If \(a\) is even, we can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of dimensions \(a/2 \times b\).
   - If \(b\) is even, we can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of dimensions \(a \times b/2\).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If either condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases where \(a\) and \(b\) are both odd correctly by printing "No".
   - The program also handles the case where \(a\) or \(b\) is even correctly by printing "Yes".

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the problem requirements, producing "Yes" or "No" for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given dimensions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
