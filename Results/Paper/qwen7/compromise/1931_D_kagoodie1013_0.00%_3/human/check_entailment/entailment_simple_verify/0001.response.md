### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Extraction**:
   - The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input and extracts the necessary parameters (`n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`) for each test case.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case individually.
   - It initializes two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the required remainders (`mod_x` and `mod_y`).
   - The logic for calculating `mod_x` and `mod_y` is correct:
     - `mod_x = -num % x` ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `mod_y = num % y` ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

3. **Count Calculation**:
   - For each element `num` in the array, the program checks if there are any previous elements that have the same `mod_x` and `mod_y` values. If so, these pairs are considered beautiful.
   - The count of such pairs is incremented accordingly.
   - The final count for each test case is correctly added to the `results` list.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, which is correct.

### Evaluation:

- **Original Assessment**:
  - The original assessment correctly identified that the program reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the number of beautiful pairs accurately.
  - The logic for determining beautiful pairs is sound.

- **Annotated Code**:
  - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points, validating the original assessment.

Based on the detailed analysis and the annotations, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
