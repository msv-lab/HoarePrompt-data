Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in arr:`. The objects involved here are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `arr` is part of each tuple in the `test_cases` list.
   - `num` is an element from the `arr` list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `arr`. For the loop to start, `arr` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `arr` is part of the tuples in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, `arr` must have at least one element.
   - The variable `num` will take the value of each element in `arr` during each iteration, but we don't need to specify its exact value initially because the loop will handle that.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs adjustment is the state of `arr` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, each tuple must have exactly four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and `arr` must have at least one element, `count` is 0, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary**.
