Output State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, each tuple must have exactly four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `count` is 0; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The line `mod_y_map = {}` creates a new empty dictionary named `mod_y_map`. This does not affect the values of `test_cases`, `count`, or `mod_x_map`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state of these variables, with `mod_y_map` now being an empty dictionary.
