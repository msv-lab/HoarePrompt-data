Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the size of an array (n), and two integers (x and y). It also includes a list of n integers representing the elements of the array. For each tuple, the function calculates the sum of counts for each element based on specific modulo operations with x and y. It then returns a list containing the sum of counts for each tuple in the input list.**
