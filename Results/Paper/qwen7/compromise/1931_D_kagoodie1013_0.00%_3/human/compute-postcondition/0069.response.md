Output State: **`count` is 0, `n` is the next value of the first element in `test_cases`, `x` is the next value of the second element in `test_cases`, `y` is the next value of the third element in `test_cases`, `arr` is the next value of the fourth element in `test_cases` and must have at least one element, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_y` is `num % y`**

Explanation: The code calculates `mod_y` which is the remainder when `num` (the first element of `arr`) is divided by `y`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
