Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) representing the size of the array and Polycarp's favorite integers, followed by a list of n integers representing the elements of the array; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    count = 0
    mod_x_map = {}
    mod_y_map = {}
    for num in arr:
        mod_x = -num % x
        mod_y = num % y
        count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
        mod_x_key = num % x
        mod_y_key = num % y
        mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
        mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After executing `results.append(count)`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, which is the sum of the counts of all possible remainders when each number in `arr` is divided by `x` and `y`, plus the initial increment for the first iteration. `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` remain unchanged, and `count` remains the same as its final calculated value. `test_cases` remains a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, each tuple having exactly four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The `count` variable will hold the sum of all occurrences where the modulo operations result in keys that have been previously seen and stored in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`. For each iteration, `mod_x_key` will be set to `num % x` and `mod_y_key` will be set to `num % y`. After all iterations, `mod_x_map` will contain the count of each unique `mod_x_key` encountered, and `mod_y_map` will contain the count of each unique `mod_y_key` encountered. The `results` list will have one additional element which is the final value of `count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `count` is the sum of `mod_x_map.get(x, 0)` plus `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` plus the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` for each iteration, plus the total number of iterations (which is the length of `arr`), `n` is the next value of the first element in `test_cases`, `x` is the next value of the second element in `test_cases`, `y` is the next value of the third element in `test_cases`, `arr` is the next value of the fourth element in `test_cases` and must have all its elements processed, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is `num % y` for each element in `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that remainder appears, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary where each key is `-num % x` for each element in `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that remainder appears, `num` is the last element of `arr` that was processed, and `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
