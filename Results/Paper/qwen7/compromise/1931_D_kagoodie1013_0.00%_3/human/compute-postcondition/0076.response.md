Output State: **`count` is `mod_x_map.get(x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(num % y, 0) + 1`, `n` is the next value of the first element in `test_cases`, `x` is the next value of the second element in `test_cases`, `y` is the next value of the third element in `test_cases`, `arr` is the next value of the fourth element in `test_cases` and must have at least two elements, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `{mod_y_key: 1}`, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` is 1, `mod_x` is `-num % x`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `mod_x` which is `-num % x`. The value of `mod_x` depends on the current values of `num` and `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
