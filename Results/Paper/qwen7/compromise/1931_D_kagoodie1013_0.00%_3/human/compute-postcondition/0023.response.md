Output State: **`mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is incremented by 1, `mod_x` is `-num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`**

Explanation: The code calculates `mod_y` which is `num % y`. It does not modify `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` or `mod_x` further, so these values remain unchanged from their initial state. The new value of `mod_y` is calculated based on the current value of `num`.
