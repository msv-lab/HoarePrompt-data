Output State: **`count` is 0, `n` is the next value of the first element in `test_cases`, `x` is the next value of the second element in `test_cases`, `y` is the next value of the third element in `test_cases`, `arr` is the next value of the fourth element in `test_cases`**.

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `count` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `count` is updated to 0.
