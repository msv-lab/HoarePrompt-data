Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and a parameter `cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in `cases` contains two integers `n` and `k` where `n` is between 2 and 10^6, and `k` is between 1 and `n`. The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (25, [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]).**

This means the function takes a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases` as inputs. It then returns a specific list of tuples containing the integer 25 and a predefined list of powers of 2.
