Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The function `func_1` generates a sequence of powers of 2, which does not ensure that there is no subsequence with a sum equal to `k`. It only ensures that the generated sequence has a length of 25.

2. **No Consideration for `k`**: The sequence `[2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^24]` will always include subsequences that sum up to any value, including `k`, because the sum of any subset of these powers of 2 can be represented using binary representation.

3. **Output Format**: While the program correctly prints the size of the sequence and the sequence itself, it does not meet the requirement of ensuring that no subsequence sums to `k`.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to generate a sequence that avoids having any subsequence summing to `k` while still allowing all other values from 1 to `n` to be formed by some subsequence. One possible approach could involve generating a sequence that includes values that are not easily combined to form `k` while still allowing all other values to be formed.
