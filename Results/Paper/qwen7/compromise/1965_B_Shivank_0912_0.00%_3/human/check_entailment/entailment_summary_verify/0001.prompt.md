You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
cases = []
index = 1
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    k = int(data[index + 1])
    cases.append((n, k))
    index += 2
results = func_1(t, cases)
for result in results:
    print(result[0])
    print(' '.join(map(str, result[1])))

def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []
    sequence = [2 ** i for i in range(25)]
    for (n, k) in cases:
        results.append((25, sequence))
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. Each tuple in `cases` contains two integers `n` and `k` where `n` ranges from 2 to \(10^6\) and `k` ranges from 1 to `n`. The function generates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the pair (25, [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]). This list is then returned by the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into parts.
   - It correctly processes the number of test cases (`t`) and pairs of integers `(n, k)` for each test case.

2. **Generating Sequences:**
   - The `func_1` function generates a fixed sequence `[2 ** i for i in range(25)]`, which is a list of powers of 2 up to \(2^{24}\).
   - This sequence has exactly 25 elements, which satisfies the constraint \(1 \le m \le 25\).

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - For each test case, the generated sequence is used without modification.
   - The sequence `[2 ** i for i in range(25)]` ensures that:
     - No subsequence sums to \(k\) because \(k\) is not a power of 2.
     - All integers from 1 to \(n\) (where \(n \geq 8\)) can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2 (by the binary representation property).

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The problem guarantees that a solution always exists, and the fixed sequence meets the requirements for \(n \geq 8\).
   - For smaller values of \(n\), the sequence still works because the required sums can be formed from the available elements (e.g., for \(n = 2\), the sequence `[1]` works).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence that meets the given conditions for all test cases. The fixed sequence of powers of 2 ensures that no subsequence sums to \(k\) while allowing all other sums from 1 to \(n\).
