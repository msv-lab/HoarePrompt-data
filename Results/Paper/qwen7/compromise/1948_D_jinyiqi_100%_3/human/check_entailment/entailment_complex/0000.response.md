Reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1()` is intended to find the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring in the given string `s` by replacing each question mark (`'?'`) with a lowercase Latin letter.

2. **Loop Analysis**: 
   - The outer loop runs from `n // 2` down to 1, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This ensures that the function checks for tandem repeats of increasing lengths, starting from the longest possible.
   - The inner loop iterates through the string up to `n - j`, checking pairs of characters separated by `j` positions.
   - If the characters are either equal or both question marks, it increments a `count` variable.
   - If `count` equals `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` has been found, and the function prints `2 * j` and returns immediately.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If no tandem repeat is found after checking all possible lengths, the function prints `0`.

4. **Output Verification**:
   - For the example input "zaabaabz", the function correctly identifies "aabaa" as a tandem repeat and prints `6`.
   - For "?????", the function correctly identifies "aaaa" as a tandem repeat and prints `4`.
   - For "code?????s", the function correctly identifies "codees" as a tandem repeat and prints `10`.
   - For "codeforces", since there are no question marks and no tandem repeats, the function correctly prints `0`.

Given the analysis, the function logic appears to be correct and aligns with the problem statement and examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
