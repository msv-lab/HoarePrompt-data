Reasoning:
- The provided program has a logical flaw in how it attempts to find tandem repeats.
- The function `func_1()` iterates through the string from the middle to the beginning, checking for pairs of characters that are either equal or both question marks.
- However, this approach does not guarantee finding the longest possible tandem repeat. For example, it might miss longer tandem repeats that start earlier in the string.
- The program should instead construct the string by replacing each question mark with a character that maximizes the length of the longest tandem repeat.
- The current implementation does not actually perform the necessary replacements to maximize the tandem repeat length; it only checks for existing tandem repeats without making any changes to the input string.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, one would need to implement an algorithm that constructs the string by replacing each question mark with a character that maximizes the length of the longest tandem repeat. This could involve dynamic programming or other combinatorial optimization techniques.
