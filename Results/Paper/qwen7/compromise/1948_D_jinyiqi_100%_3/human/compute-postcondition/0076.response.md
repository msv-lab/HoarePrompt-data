Postcondition: `count` is an integer, `s` is a string, `k` and `j` are indices within the string `s`. If the character at index `k` in `s` is either a '?', the character at index `k+j` in `s` is either a '?', or the characters at indices `k` and `k+j` in `s` are the same, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.
