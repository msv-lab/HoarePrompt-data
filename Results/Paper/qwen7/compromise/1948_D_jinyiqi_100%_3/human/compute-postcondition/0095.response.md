To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `count` is an integer.
   - `k` is defined as `n - j - 1`.
   - There is a string `s` which is not explicitly defined, but it is used in the conditions.
   - The conditions for incrementing `count` are:
     - `s[k]` is a question mark (`?`).
     - `s[k + j]` is a question mark (`?`).
     - `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(count * 2)
   ```

Given these conditions, let's analyze what `count` could be:

- If any of the three conditions in the initial state are met, `count` is incremented by 1.
- If none of the conditions are met, `count` remains 0.

Since the exact values of `s`, `n`, and `j` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `count`. However, based on the conditions, `count` can either be 0 or 1.

Therefore, the output of `print(count * 2)` will be:

Output: **0 or 2**
