Based on the initial state provided:

- `count` is an integer.
- `s` is a string.
- `k` is defined as `k_prev + 1`.
- `j` is the same as before.
- The character at index `k_prev + 1` in `s` is neither a '?'.
- The character at index `(k_prev + 1) + j` in `s` is not a '?'.
- The characters at indices `k_prev + 1` and `(k_prev + 1) + j` in `s` are not the same.
- If the character at index `k` in `s` is '?', the character at index `k + j` in `s` is '?', or the characters at indices `k` and `k + j` in `s` are the same, then `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.

Given these conditions, let's break down the logic:

1. The character at index `k_prev + 1` is not a '?'.
2. The character at index `(k_prev + 1) + j` is not a '?'.
3. These two characters are not the same.

However, the conditions for incrementing `count` involve checking if the character at index `k` is '?', the character at index `k + j` is '?', or if the characters at indices `k` and `k + j` are the same. Since none of these conditions are met (as per the given information), `count` does not get incremented.

Therefore, `count` remains 0.

Finally, the print statement is:
```python
print(count * 2)
```

Since `count` is 0, `count * 2` is also 0.

Output: **0**
