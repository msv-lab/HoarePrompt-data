You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        line = input('')

        a = [1000]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])

        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until `t` becomes 0. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0. For each iteration, `n` will be set to the value of an integer input, `i` will reach the value of `n`, and `a` will be a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the first `i-1` elements from the list `T`. The `result` will be a string containing the cumulative sums separated by spaces for each value of `n` processed during the loop iterations.
    #
    #Since the loop runs until `t` becomes 0, the final state will have `t` as 0, and `result` will contain the cumulative sums for all the `n` values provided by the user during the loop iterations, each separated by spaces and listed sequentially.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases defined by the variable `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, where `n` represents the number of elements in a sequence and `x` is a list of `n-1` integers. It then calculates the cumulative sum of the sequence starting from 1000 and appends each sum to a list `a`. Finally, it prints the list `a` as a space-separated string for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the cumulative sums for all provided sequences.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, the program generates an array `a` such that each element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding `x_i` value from the input. However, this approach does not guarantee that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 4 1
```
The program will generate:
```
3 5 9
```
But this does not satisfy the condition:
```
5 \bmod 3 != 2
9 \bmod 5 != 1
```

A correct solution would need to ensure that the generated `a_i` values satisfy the modulo condition for all `2 \le i \le n`. The provided solution does not meet this requirement.
