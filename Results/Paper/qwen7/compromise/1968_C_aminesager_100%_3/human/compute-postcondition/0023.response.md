Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`. Since `i` starts at `n`, the loop will not execute because `i` is not less than `n` initially.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n` at some point during the loop iterations. This means `i` should start at a value less than `n`.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `n`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Adjusted State**:
- `i` should be less than `n` for the loop to execute.

So, the final state after adjustment would be:

State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer**
