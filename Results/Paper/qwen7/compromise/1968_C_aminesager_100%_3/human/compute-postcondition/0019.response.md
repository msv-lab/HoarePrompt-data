Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements from `T`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is false.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to an integer input from the user. The other variables (`i`, `a`, `result`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
