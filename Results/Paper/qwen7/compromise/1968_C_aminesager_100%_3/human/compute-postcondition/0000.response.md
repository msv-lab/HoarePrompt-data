Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and it is the integer input by the user; `n` is an integer, and it is the integer input by the user such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; `x` is not defined yet.**

This output state reflects that `t` has been updated to the integer input by the user, which is within the range of 1 to 10^4. Similarly, `n` has been updated to the integer input by the user, which is within the range of 2 to 500. The list `x` has not been defined or initialized yet, as no code has been executed to create or modify it.
