Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and it must be non-zero, `n` is an input integer, `x` is not defined yet, a line of input is stored in the variable `line`**.

The code `line = input('')` reads a line of input from the user and stores it in the variable `line`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `x` is not defined before or after the execution of this code.
