Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `a` is a list with an additional element equal to `a[2] + T[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` appends a new element to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 3, `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`, and `T[i - 1]` is `T[2]`. Since `a` initially has an additional element equal to `a[1] + T[1]`, after appending, `a` will have an additional element equal to `a[2] + T[2]`. The conditions and values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
