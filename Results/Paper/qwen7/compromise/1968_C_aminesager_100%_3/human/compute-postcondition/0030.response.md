Output State: `i` is `n`, `a` is a list starting with `[1000]` and then each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding value from the list `T` up to `n-1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1` and stops. The list `a` will contain `n` elements where the first element is `1000`, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the previous element and the corresponding value from the list `T`.
