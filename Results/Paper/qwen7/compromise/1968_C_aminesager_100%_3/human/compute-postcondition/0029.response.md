Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list where each element is calculated as the sum of the previous element in the list and the corresponding element in the list `T`. The length of `a` is `n`.

To explain this in more detail:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`.
- In each iteration, the value of `a[i]` is set to `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`.
- After all iterations, `a` will contain `n` elements, with the first element being `1000` (initially set) and each subsequent element being the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element from the list `T`.

For example, if `n = 4` and `T = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, then after the loop completes, `a` would be `[1000, 1001, 1003, 1006]`.
