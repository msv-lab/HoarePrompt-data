Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used to determine the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**: We know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This means the input value will be within this range.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop will execute `int(input())` times. For the loop to execute at least once, the input value must be at least 1. Since `t` is guaranteed to be a positive integer between 1 and 100, the loop will always execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the state**: The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value, which will be assigned to the loop variable `_` (a dummy variable).

Given the above analysis, the state before the loop starts should include the fact that the input value will be a positive integer between 1 and 100, ensuring the loop executes at least once.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and the input value for the loop will be a positive integer between 1 and 100**
