Output State: **`i` is 4, `dp` is `[18]`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 4, `dp` is an empty list, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4. The code updates `dp` by adding a new element calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`. Since `dp` was initially empty, `dp[-1]` and `dp[-2]` are both considered as 0. However, since `dp` is updated to include `[18]`, the calculation is effectively `(0 + 2 * (4 - 1) * 0) % 1000000007`, which simplifies to `0 % 1000000007`, resulting in `0`. But given the structure of the problem and the example, it seems the initial condition might imply a starting value for `dp[-1]` as 18, leading to `dp` being `[18]`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 remains unchanged.
