Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(2, n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `dp` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` should be updated to 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `dp` remains an empty list since it is not affected by the loop head variables.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `dp` is an empty list**
