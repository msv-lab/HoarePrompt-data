Output State: **`i` is 3; `dp` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `dp.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `dp`. Initially, `dp` contains one element which is `(0 + 2 * (3 - 1) * 0) % 1000000007`. After popping the first element, `dp` becomes an empty list. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
