Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Moves**: The program subtracts moves from `n` directly without considering the constraints of the problem. Specifically, it should handle the fact that the board size decreases by 2 for each pair of non-diagonal moves and by 1 for each diagonal move.

2. **Function `func_1` Usage**: The function `func_1` is used to calculate something related to the number of configurations, but it is not correctly implemented to solve the problem. The logic inside `func_1` does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

3. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is applied incorrectly. The correct modulo should be `10^9 + 7`, but the code uses `7 + 10^9` which is incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def count_final_configurations(n, k):
    # Calculate the number of free rows and columns left after k moves
    free_rows = n - k
    free_cols = n - k
    
    # If there are any diagonal moves, reduce the free rows and cols by 1
    if k > 0:
        free_rows -= 1
        free_cols -= 1
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining rows and columns
    if free_rows == 0 or free_cols == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return (free_rows * free_cols) % MOD

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (n, k) = (L[0], L[1])
    for j in range(k):
        L1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (a, b) = (L1[0], L1[1])
        if a != b:
            n -= 2
        else:
            n -= 1
    print(count_final_configurations(n, k))
```

This corrected version properly calculates the number of free rows and columns after the initial moves and handles the diagonal and non-diagonal moves correctly.
