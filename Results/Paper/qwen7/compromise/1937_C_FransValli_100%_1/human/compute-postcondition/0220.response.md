Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is explicitly given as 10.
- `res` is an input value from the user, but its specific value is not provided.
- `arr` must have at least 3 elements, but the exact elements are not specified.

Given this information, the `print` statement includes placeholders for variables that are not fully defined. Specifically, `mini` and `item` are not mentioned in the initial state, so their values cannot be determined from the given information.

Therefore, the output will include the placeholder values for `mini` and `item`, along with the known value for `res`.

Output: **'? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]** (where `[mini]` and `[item]` are unknown values and `res` is the input value from the user).
