Based on the initial state provided:

- `maxi` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1 (though its exact value is not specified).
- `res` and `arr` are updated within the loop body, but their exact values are not provided.
- `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'`.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

The values of `maxi` and `i` are explicitly provided:
- `maxi` is 0.
- `i` is 1.

The `flush=True` parameter ensures that the output is immediately written to the console, but it does not affect the content of the output.

Therefore, the print statement will output the following:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
