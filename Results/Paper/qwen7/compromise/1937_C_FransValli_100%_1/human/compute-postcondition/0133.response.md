Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `res` is an input string, and `arr` is a list containing the elements from 1 to `n-1`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. The variable `res` will be whatever the last input was (either '<' or '='), but the exact value is not specified in the final state. The variable `arr` will contain all the values from `1` to `n-1` because each iteration either appends the current value of `i` to `arr` or leaves it unchanged based on the input received.
