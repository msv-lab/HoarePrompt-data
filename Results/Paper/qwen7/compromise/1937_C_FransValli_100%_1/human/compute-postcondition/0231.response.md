Output State: **`total` is 10, `res` is the user's input value from the last iteration, `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1` in any order, `mini` retains its original value (which could either be `n-1` or undefined based on user inputs), `maxi` equals `n-1`, and `i` equals `n`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `total` remains unchanged at 10. The array `arr` retains its original state with all integers from 0 to `n-1` in any order. The variable `maxi` stays at `n-1` because it was never modified within the loop. The variable `i` remains equal to `n` as it was not altered in the loop. The variable `mini` retains its value based on the user's inputs during each iteration; if `res` was '>' for any iteration, `mini` is updated to the current `item`. Otherwise, `mini` remains undefined.
