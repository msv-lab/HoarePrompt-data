Output State: **`arr` must have at least 2 elements, `item` is `arr[1]`, `res` is an input string**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `res`. Since no specific value is provided for the input, `res` will hold the string value entered by the user. The values of `arr` and `item` remain unchanged from their initial state.
