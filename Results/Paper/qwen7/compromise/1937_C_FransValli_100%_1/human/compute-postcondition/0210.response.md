Output State: **All iterations completed, `i` equals `n`, `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1` in any order, `maxi` equals `n-1`, `mini` equals `n-1` if `res` was `'> '` for all iterations, otherwise `mini` is undefined as the condition was never met, `total` is 10, and `res` is an input value from the user for the last iteration.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, so it will execute `n-1` times.
- In each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
- Depending on the input `res`, `arr` is either updated to `[i]` or appended with `i`.
- After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`.
- `arr` will contain all integers from 0 to `n-1` in some order because each integer is added to `arr` at least once.
- `maxi` remains `n-1` as it is not modified within the loop.
- `mini` will be `n-1` if `res` was `'> '` for all iterations, otherwise, its value is undefined since the condition `res == '>'` was never checked in the provided code.
- `total` remains 10 as it is not affected by the loop.
- `res` will be the input value from the user for the last iteration.
