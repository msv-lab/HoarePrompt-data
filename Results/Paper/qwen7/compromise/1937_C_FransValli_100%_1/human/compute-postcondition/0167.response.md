Based on the initial state provided:

- `maxi` is explicitly given as 1.
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` must be greater than 1, but its exact value is not specified, so it doesn't affect the print statement directly.
- `res` is an input string, but its value is not specified, so it also doesn't affect the print statement directly.
- `arr` is updated based on the loop body, but its exact value is not specified, so it doesn't affect the print statement directly.
- `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'`, but its exact value is not specified, so it doesn't affect the print statement directly.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

Given the explicit values:
- `maxi` is 1.
- `i` is 2.

The print statement will output:
Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
