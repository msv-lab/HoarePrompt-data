Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is explicitly given as 10.
- `res` is the user's input value from the last iteration, but its specific value is not provided.
- `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1` in any order.
- `mini` retains its original value, which could either be `n-1` or undefined based on user inputs.
- `maxi` equals `n-1`.
- `i` equals `n`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
```

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of what will be printed:

- `'!'` is a literal string.
- `maxi` is given as `n-1`.
- `mini` could be `n-1` or undefined, but since it is retained from the previous state and no other information is provided about its value, we keep it as `mini`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **! n-1 mini**
