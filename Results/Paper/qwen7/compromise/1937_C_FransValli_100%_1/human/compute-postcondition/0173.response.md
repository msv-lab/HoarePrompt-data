Based on the initial state provided:

- `maxi` is set to 2.
- `i` is set to 3.
- `res` is an input string (its value is not explicitly given).
- `arr` is updated based on the loop body (the exact updates are not provided, so we cannot determine its value).
- `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'` (the exact value of `mini` is not provided).
- `n` must be greater than 3.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

This statement will print the following:
- The character `'?'`
- The value of `maxi`, which is 2.
- The value of `maxi` again, which is 2.
- The value of `i`, which is 3.
- The value of `i` again, which is 3.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? 2 2 3 3'**
