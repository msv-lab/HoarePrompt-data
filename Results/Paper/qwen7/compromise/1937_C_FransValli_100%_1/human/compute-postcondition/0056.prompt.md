Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be at least 4, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string, where the value of `res` is '<' for each iteration from 1 to `n-1`, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '<':
        arr = [i]
    elif res == '=':
        arr.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is a value in the range [1, n-1], `n` must be at least 4, `res` is a string, and `arr` is a list containing the value of `i`. If `res` is equal to '<', `arr` contains the value of `i`. If `res` is not equal to '<' and equals '=', `arr` remains unchanged. If `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `arr` still contains the value of `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be at least 4, `res` is an input string, and `arr` is a list containing `[i + 1]` if `res` equals '<', otherwise `arr` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is either `i_prev + 1` or `i_prev + 2`, `n` must be at least 4, `res` is an input string, `arr` contains either `[i]` or `[i_prev + 1, i]` with `i` appended to `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
