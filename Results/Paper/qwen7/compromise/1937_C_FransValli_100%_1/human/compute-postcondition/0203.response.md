Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is `i_new`, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` could be `[i_new]` or `[0, i_new]`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input value from the user, `mini` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `res`. The values of the other variables (`total`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, `maxi`, and `mini`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
