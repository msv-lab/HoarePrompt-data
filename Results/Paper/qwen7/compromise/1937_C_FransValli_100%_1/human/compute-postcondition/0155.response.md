Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0.
- `res` is the final input string received after the last iteration.
- `arr` must have at least `n` elements.
- `mini` is now equal to the last element of `arr` if `res` is equal to '>', otherwise `mini` remains unchanged.

We need to determine the values of `maxi` and `mini` to understand what will be printed.

However, the initial state does not explicitly define `maxi`. Given the context, it's reasonable to assume `maxi` might be related to the maximum value in `arr`, but without more specific information, we cannot definitively state its value. For the sake of this exercise, let's consider the following:

- If `res` is '>', then `mini` is set to the last element of `arr`.
- Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.

Since `maxi` is not defined in the initial state, we can only describe it in a general form. Given the lack of explicit definition, we'll focus on `mini`.

Let's break down the print statement:

```python
print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
```

- The first argument is `'!'`.
- The second argument is `maxi`, whose value is unknown from the given information.
- The third argument is `mini`, which is either the last element of `arr` if `res` is '>', or remains unchanged from its previous value.

Given the information, the most precise description we can provide is:

Output: **! ! [mini_value]** (where [mini_value] is the last element of `arr` if `res` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged)
