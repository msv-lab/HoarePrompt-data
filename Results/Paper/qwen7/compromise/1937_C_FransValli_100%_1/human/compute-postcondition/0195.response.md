Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `arr` is `[i]`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input value from user, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'` if the loop executes `n-1` times, and `res` is set to '=' if the condition `res == '<'` is met.**

Explanation: The code `arr = [i]` updates the list `arr` to contain the single element `i`. The other variables (`total`, `n`, `maxi`, `res`, and `mini`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `i` is `i + 1`, but since `i` itself is not defined outside of this context, we keep it as `i + 1`. The value of `res` is now an input value from the user, and `mini` is updated based on the conditions specified.
