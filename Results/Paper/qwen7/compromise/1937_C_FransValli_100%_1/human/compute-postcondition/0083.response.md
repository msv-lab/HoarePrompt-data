Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1, but its exact value is not specified.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

Here, `maxi` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, since the print statement includes `maxi` twice, we can represent it as `maxi`.

Given this information, the print statement will output a string with the following components:
- `'?'` (a question mark)
- `maxi` (the value of `maxi`)
- `maxi` (the value of `maxi` again)
- `i` (which is 1)
- `i` (which is 1 again)

So, the output will be:
Output: **'? [maxi] [maxi] 1 1'**
