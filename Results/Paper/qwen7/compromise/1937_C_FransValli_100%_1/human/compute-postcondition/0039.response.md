Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `i + 1`: This means `i` is incremented by 1. However, since `i` is not explicitly given a starting value, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` after the increment. We only know that `i` has been incremented by 1.
   - `n` must be at least 4: This tells us that `n` is an integer with a minimum value of 4, but no specific value is given.
   - `res` is a string: This variable is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
   - `arr` is a list containing the value of `i`: Since `i` has been incremented by 1, `arr` will contain the value of `i + 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)`.
   - `maxi` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. Therefore, we will leave it as `maxi`.
   - `arr[0]` is the first element of the list `arr`, which contains the value of `i + 1`.
   - `i` is the value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1.

Given this analysis, the output will include the string `'?'`, followed by the value of `maxi`, then the value of `arr[0]` (which is `i + 1`), another occurrence of `maxi`, and finally the value of `i` (which is `i + 1`).

Output: **'? maxi i+1 maxi i+1'**
