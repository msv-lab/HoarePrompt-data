Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be at least 4, `res` is an input string, `arr` is a list containing `[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `arr` with the value of `i`. Given the initial state where `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` will contain the value `i + 1`. The conditions for `n` and `res` remain unchanged.
