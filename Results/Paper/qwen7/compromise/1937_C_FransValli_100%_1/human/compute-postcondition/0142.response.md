Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for item in arr[1:]`. The variables involved here are `item` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop starts from `arr[1]` (the second element of `arr`) and iterates over each subsequent element until the end of the list.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `res` is either the new input string which is equal to '>', or the original `res` string
   - `arr` must have at least 2 elements
   - `item` is the second element of `arr`
   - `mini` is the second element of `arr`

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `item` should be the third element of `arr` (since the loop starts from the second element).
   - `arr` must still have at least 3 elements to ensure there is a third element.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `item` is the second element in the previous iteration, it will be the third element in the next iteration.
   - `arr` must now have at least 3 elements to allow the loop to continue.

Given these points, the updated states for the next iteration are:

- `i` remains `n`
- `n` must still be greater than 0
- `res` remains either the new input string which is equal to '>', or the original `res` string
- `arr` must now have at least 3 elements
- `item` will be the third element of `arr`
- `mini` will be the third element of `arr`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `res` is either the new input string which is equal to '>', or the original `res` string, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `item` is the third element of `arr`, `mini` is the third element of `arr`**
