Output State: **`maxi` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `res` is an input string, `arr` is updated based on the loop body, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'`.**

Explanation: The code `maxi = i` updates the variable `maxi` to the current value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
