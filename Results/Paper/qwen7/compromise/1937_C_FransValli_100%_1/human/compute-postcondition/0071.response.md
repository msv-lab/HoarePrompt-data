Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `item` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `arr[1:]`, meaning it starts from the second element of `arr` (index 1) and goes until the end.

3. **Determine the current state**:
   - `arr` must have at least 3 elements.
   - `item` is currently `arr[2]`.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - `mini` is unchanged if `res` was '>', otherwise `mini` is set to `arr[2]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `arr[1:]`, the next `item` will be `arr[3]` (if `arr` has at least 4 elements).
   - Therefore, `item` should be updated to `arr[3]`.
   - `res` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.
   - `mini` remains unchanged if `res` was '>', otherwise it is set to `arr[3]`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `arr` must still have at least 3 elements.
   - `item` should be `arr[3]`.
   - `res` remains unchanged.
   - `mini` remains unchanged if `res` was '>', otherwise it is set to `arr[3]`.

**Final State**:
State: **`arr` must have at least 3 elements, `item` is `arr[3]`, `res` is an input string, `mini` is unchanged if `res` was '>', `mini` is set to `arr[3]` if `res` equals '>'**
