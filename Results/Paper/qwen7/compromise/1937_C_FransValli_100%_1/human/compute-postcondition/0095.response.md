Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `n` in the expression `for i in range(1, n):`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration (`i` is 1), the second iteration (`i` is 2) has just completed.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true, so `n` must remain greater than 3 (since `i` is now 3).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3.
   - The other variables (`res` and `maxi`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
