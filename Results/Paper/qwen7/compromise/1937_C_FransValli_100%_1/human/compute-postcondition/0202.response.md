Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `total` is 10.
   - `i` is `i_new`.
   - `n` remains unchanged (though its value is not explicitly given, we will consider it as a constant).
   - `arr` could be either `[i_new]` or `[0, i_new]`.
   - `maxi` is `n-1`.
   - `res` is an input value from the user.
   - `mini` will be updated if the loop executes `n-1` times and `res == '>'`, otherwise, it remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `maxi` is `n-1`.
- `arr[0]` will be either `i_new` or `0` depending on the value of `arr`.

Given this information, let's determine the output:

- `'?'` is a literal string that will be printed.
- `maxi` is `n-1`.
- `arr[0]` will be either `i_new` or `0`.
- `i` is `i_new`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` (the question mark)
- `maxi` (which is `n-1`)
- `arr[0]` (either `i_new` or `0`)
- `maxi` again (which is `n-1`)
- `i` (which is `i_new`)

So, the output will be one of the following two possibilities, depending on the value of `arr[0]`:

1. If `arr[0] = i_new`:
   ```
   '?', n-1, i_new, n-1, i_new
   ```

2. If `arr[0] = 0`:
   ```
   '?', n-1, 0, n-1, i_new
   ```

Since the exact value of `i_new` and `n` is not specified, we'll represent them symbolically.

Output: **'? n-1 [i_new or 0] n-1 [i_new]'**
