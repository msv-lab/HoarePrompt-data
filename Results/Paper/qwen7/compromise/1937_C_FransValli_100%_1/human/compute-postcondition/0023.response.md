Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be at least 4, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string, where the value of `res` is '<' for each iteration from 1 to `n-1`, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `arr` with a single element `0`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `maxi`, or `res`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
