Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is 10.
- `i` is less than `n`, but the exact value of `i` is not specified.
- `n` is unchanged, but its value is not provided.
- `arr` is a list containing a single element `[0]`.
- `maxi` is `n-1`.
- `res` is an input string, but its value is not specified.
- `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'` if the loop executes `n-1` times.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down the components to be printed:

1. `'?'` - This is a literal string and will be printed as is.
2. `maxi` - Since `maxi` is `n-1`, it will be printed as `n-1`.
3. `arr[0]` - The list `arr` contains only one element `[0]`, so `arr[0]` is `0`.
4. `maxi` - Again, this will be `n-1`.
5. `i` - The value of `i` is less than `n`, but without knowing the exact value of `n`, we cannot determine the exact value of `i`.

Since `mini` is only updated if the loop executes `n-1` times, and `i` is less than `n`, `mini` will be updated if the loop runs `n-1` times. However, the exact value of `mini` is not needed to answer the question.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? n-1 0 n-1 i'**
