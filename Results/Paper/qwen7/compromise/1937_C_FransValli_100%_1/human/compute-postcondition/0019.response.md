Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 3, `maxi` is 3, `res` is an input string**.

Explanation: The code `maxi = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `maxi`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `maxi` is updated to 3, while `t`, `n`, `i`, and `res` retain their original values.
