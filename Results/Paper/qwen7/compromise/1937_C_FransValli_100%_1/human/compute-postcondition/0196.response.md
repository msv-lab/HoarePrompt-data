Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `arr` is either `[i + 1]` or `[0, i + 1]`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input value from user, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'` if the loop executes `n-1` times, and `res` is set to '=' if the condition `res == '<'` is met.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is `i + 1` given the initial state) to the list `arr`. Since `i` was initially `i + 1`, appending `i` means appending `i + 1` to `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
