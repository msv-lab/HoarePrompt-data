Output State: **`maxi` is 3, `i` is 3, `res` is an input string, `arr` is updated based on the loop body, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>', and n is greater than 3.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `maxi` to the value of `i`, which was initially 3. All other variables (`res`, `arr`, `mini`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
