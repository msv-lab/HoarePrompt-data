Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` because the range function in Python is exclusive of the upper bound. Therefore, the loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `maxi` is 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `res` is an input string
   - `arr` is updated based on the loop body
   - `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently `1`, the loop will continue if `n > 1`.
   - `i` will be incremented by `1` in the next iteration, making it `2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is `2`
- `n` must still be greater than `1`

The other variables (`maxi`, `res`, `arr`, `mini`) are not part of the loop head and their values remain unchanged.

**State: **`maxi` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `res` is an input string, `arr` is updated based on the loop body, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'`**
