Output State: **`a` is an input integer decremented by 1, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The variable `a` retains its value as an input integer decremented by 1. The new variable `b` is created by taking the input from the user, splitting it into a list of strings, and then converting each string in the list to an integer using the `map` function.
