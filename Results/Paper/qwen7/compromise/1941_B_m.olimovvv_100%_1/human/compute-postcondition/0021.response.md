Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is an integer greater than 3.
   - `b` is a list of integers with specific conditions:
     - The second element of `b` is 0.
     - The third element of `b` is decreased by the first element of `b`.
     - The fourth element of `b` is the third element minus the second element.

2. **Determine the Values**:
   - Let's denote the elements of `b` as `b[0]`, `b[1]`, `b[2]`, and `b[3]`.
   - Given `b[1] = 0`.
   - `b[2] = b[0] - a`, since it is stated that the third element is decreased by the first element.
   - `b[3] = b[2] - b[1] = (b[0] - a) - 0 = b[0] - a`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Based on the initial state and the print statement, the output will be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
