You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each element a_j in the array. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is less than 3, `b` is a list of integers where all elements are zero, and the final output printed is 'YES'.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `a` will be less than 3 because each iteration decrements `a` by 1. All elements in `b` that were accessed and modified will have been processed according to the loop's logic. Since the loop processes all elements and does not encounter a negative value in `b` (which would cause an early break), and given that the operations continue until the end of the list, all elements in `b` will be reduced to 0. As a result, the conditions `if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:` will not be met, and the final output will be 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), and an array a of n integers (where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each element a_j). It returns the results based on the specified conditions for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
