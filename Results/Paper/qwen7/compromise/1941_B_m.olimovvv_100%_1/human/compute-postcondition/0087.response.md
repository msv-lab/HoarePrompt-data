Output State: **`b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `a` must be greater than `i + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` subtracts the value of `b[i]` from `b[i + 2]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `b[i + 1]` remains as `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` becomes `b[i + 2] - b[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and the condition that `a` must be greater than `i + 2` still holds true.
