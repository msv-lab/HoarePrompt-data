Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each element a_j in the array. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = int(input())
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(0, a - 2):
        if b[i] < 0:
            print('NO')
            break
        b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
        b[i + 2] -= b[i]
        b[i] -= b[i]
    else:
        if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is an integer greater than 3, `b` is a list of integers where the second element is 0, the third element is 0, the fourth element is the original fourth element minus the second element, the fifth element is the original fifth element minus twice the first element, and this process continues until the end of the list. If the last two elements are both 0, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `a` is less than 3; `b[i]` is 0 for all i; `b[i + 2]` is adjusted based on the original values of `b[i]` for all i; no 'NO' is printed, hence the final output is 'YES'.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (as determined by the initial value of `a`), `a` will be less than 3 because each iteration decrements `a` by 1. All elements in `b` that were accessed and modified (i.e., `b[i]`, `b[i+1]`, and `b[i+2]` for all valid i) will have been processed according to the loop's logic. Since the loop does not break unless `b[i] < 0` for any i, and given that the loop processes all elements, `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` will be 0. Therefore, the condition `if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:` will not be met, and the final output will be 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: All elements in list `b` are zero.

Explanation: The loop continues to subtract values from subsequent elements in the list `b` based on the current element `b[i]`. After each iteration, `b[i]` is set to 0. Given that the loop runs until `i` reaches `a-2`, and considering the operations performed within the loop, all elements in `b` will eventually be reduced to 0. If the loop completes without encountering a negative value in `b` (which would cause an early break), and the last two elements (`b[-1]` and `b[-2]`) are both 0, the loop will print 'YES'. Otherwise, it will print 'NO'. However, since we are focusing on the final state of `b`, the output state is that all elements in `b` are zero.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
