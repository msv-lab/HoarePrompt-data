Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. The value of `removed_count` depends on the condition `sorted_a[0] == favorite_value`. If this condition is true, `removed_count` is 2; otherwise, it is 1.

3. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`. Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2. This means `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `i` is set to 2. The value of `removed_count` remains unchanged unless the condition `sorted_a[0] == favorite_value` changes, but since no new information is provided about `favorite_value` or `sorted_a`, we assume `removed_count` remains as it was in the previous iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**: The new state should reflect `i` being 2 and `removed_count` remaining as it was (either 1 or 2 depending on the condition).

Given the above steps, the new state is:

State: **`i` is 2, and `removed_count` is 2 if `sorted_a[0]` equals `favorite_value`, otherwise `removed_count` is 1**
