Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `favorite_value` is equal to `a[f - 1]`, `i` is equal to `k - 1`, `removed_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` was found in `sorted_a` up to index `k - 1`, and `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[f - 1]` to the variable `favorite_value`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
