Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The values of `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    favorite_value = a[f - 1]
    sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
    removed_count = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
            removed_count += 1
    favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)
    if removed_count == favorite_count:
        print('YES')
    elif removed_count == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a` up to index `i`, `i` is equal to `k-1`, `k` is greater than 0, and `removed_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` was found in `sorted_a` up to index `i`. If `removed_count` is 0, no changes are made. Otherwise, `removed_count` is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`, `i` is equal to `k`, and `removed_count` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value`. If `removed_count` equals `favorite_count`, the function does nothing. Otherwise, `removed_count` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k-1` elements of `sorted_a`, and `removed_count` is either equal to `favorite_count` or not equal to `favorite_count`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
