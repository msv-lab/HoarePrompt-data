Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided solution correctly addresses the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: 
   - If both arrays `a` and `c` contain identical elements, the difference `D` would be zero. The code checks for this condition and prints `0` immediately.

2. **Sorting Arrays**:
   - The code sorts `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order. This ensures that when we pair elements from `a` and `c`, we maximize the differences.

3. **Pairing Elements**:
   - The code iterates through both arrays simultaneously, pairing the smallest element of `a` with the largest element of `c`, and vice versa. This maximizes the absolute differences between corresponding elements.

4. **Accumulating Differences**:
   - For each pair, it calculates the maximum difference between the current elements of `a` and `c` and accumulates these values into `ans`.

5. **Handling Single Element Arrays**:
   - If either `a` or `c` contains only one element, the code handles this case separately by calculating the difference between that single element and the maximum and minimum elements of the other array.

The logic in the provided function is sound and should produce the correct results for the given constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
