Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the arrays `a` and `c` contain elements that are not sorted in a way that maximizes the total difference. Specifically, the program sorts `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order, but this approach may not always yield the maximum possible difference.

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
4 6
5 8 6 8
8 7 5 8 2 10
```

Expected Output:
```
23
```

However, the program's output is:
```
16
```

This is because the program sorts `a` and `c` and then pairs the smallest element of `a` with the largest element of `c`, which does not necessarily maximize the total difference. For instance, in this case, pairing `5` with `10`, `8` with `8`, `6` with `7`, and `8` with `2` results in a smaller total difference than the optimal solution.

To achieve the maximum difference, we need to consider all possible pairings and select the one that maximizes the total difference. This requires a more complex algorithm, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy approach that considers all elements in both arrays.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, and the correctness is **False**.
