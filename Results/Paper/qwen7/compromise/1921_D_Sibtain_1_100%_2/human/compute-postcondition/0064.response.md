Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is 1; `ans` is 0; `k` is 3; `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input; `c` is a list of integers created from user input sorted in descending order; `len(a)` must be at least 4.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t2` to be the absolute difference between the element at index `len(a) - j` in list `a` and the element at index `len(c) - j` in list `c`. Given that `j` is 1, `t2` is now `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
