Postcondition: `i`, `j`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`, and `t2` retain their initial values as `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `ans` is max(`t1`, `t2`), `k` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` becomes 0 and `j` becomes 3. Otherwise, `i` remains 1 and `j` remains 2.
