Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split by spaces, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split by spaces. The set of elements in `a` contains only one unique element, the set of elements in `c` contains only one unique element, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`.
