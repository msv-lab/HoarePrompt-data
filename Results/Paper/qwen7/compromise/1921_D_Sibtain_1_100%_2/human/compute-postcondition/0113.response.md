Output State: **`k` is 1, `ans` is `max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), t2)`, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`**

Explanation: The code updates `t1` to the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 1. The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of the new `t1` (which is now `abs(a[i] - c[i])`) and `t2`. The initial value of `t2` is preserved as it is not modified by the code.
