Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is updated with the new value of `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is `len(a)`, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 2] - c[len(c) - 2])`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input, `c` is a list of integers created from user input sorted in descending order, and `len(a)` must be at least 4, `n` and `m` are assigned the values of two integers separated by a space from the input.**

In this output state, the variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged, `ans` is updated with the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `k` remains as the length of list `a`, `t1` and `t2` are calculated as before, and `n` and `m` are now assigned the integer values from the input. The lists `a` and `c` are still as per the initial state with `a` being sorted and `c` being sorted in descending order.
