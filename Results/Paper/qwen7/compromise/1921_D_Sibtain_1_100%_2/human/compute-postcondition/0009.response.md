Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list of sorted integers obtained from the third input split by spaces, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `c` remain unchanged. The list `a` is updated to its sorted version.
