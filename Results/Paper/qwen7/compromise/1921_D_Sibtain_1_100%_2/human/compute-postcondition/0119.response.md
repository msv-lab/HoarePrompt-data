Output State: **`k` is 1, `ans` is `max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), t2) + max(t1, t2)`, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `i` is increased by 1 if `t2` is not greater than `t1`, otherwise `j` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += max(t1, t2)` adds the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to `ans`. The values of `t1` and `t2` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is updated to include the new value. The conditions for incrementing `i` or `j` also remain valid post-execution.
