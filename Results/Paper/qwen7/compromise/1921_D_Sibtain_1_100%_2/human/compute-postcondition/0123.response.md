Output State: **`k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `ans` is `max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), t2) + max(t1, t2)` with `j` increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `k` remains unchanged at 2. The expressions for `t1`, `t2`, and `ans` remain the same, but the value of `j` has been incremented by 1.
