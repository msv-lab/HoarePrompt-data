Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, `ans` is 0, `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `k` is 0, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` remains 0, `j` remains 2, and `t2` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `i` becomes 1, `j` becomes 1, and `t2` remains unchanged.**
