Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 4, `ans` is the sum of all `max(t1, t2)` values calculated during each iteration, `k` is 3, `t1` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`, `t2` is `abs(a[0] - c[1])`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input, `c` is a list of integers created from user input.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `i`, `j`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `n`, `m`, and `c` remain unchanged. The precondition that the lengths of sets `a` and `c` are both 1 and their only elements are equal remains valid, or the function continues with the current values of `ans`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c`.
