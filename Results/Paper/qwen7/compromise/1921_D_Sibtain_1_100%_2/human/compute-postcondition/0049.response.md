Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 4, `ans` is the sum of all `max(t1, t2)` values calculated during each iteration, `k` is 3, `t1` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[0] - c[1])`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. However, since the initial values of `i`, `j`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`, and `t2` are not altered by this line of code, these variables retain their initial values. The input values for `n` and `m` are not specified, so they are represented as `an input integer` and `an input integer`, respectively.
