The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop context is provided in the given code snippet, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect their values or states.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list of sorted integers with exactly one element obtained from the third input split by spaces, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split by spaces and sorted in descending order.**
