Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer obtained from the first input.
- `m` is an integer obtained from the second input.
- `a` is a list of sorted integers with exactly one element obtained from the third input split by spaces. Therefore, `a` has only one element.
- `c` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split by spaces and sorted in descending order.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
```

Let's break down the steps:

1. `a` is a list with one element, say `x` (since the exact value is not provided, we'll denote it as `a[0] = x`).
2. `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. Let's denote the elements of `c` as `c[0], c[1], ..., c[k]` where `k` is the length of `c`.

The expression inside the `max` function calculates the maximum of two values:
- `abs(a[0] - max(c))`: This is the absolute difference between `x` and the largest element in `c`.
- `abs(a[0] - min(c))`: This is the absolute difference between `x` and the smallest element in `c`.

Since `c` is sorted in descending order, `max(c)` is `c[0]` and `min(c)` is `c[k-1]`.

Therefore, the expression becomes:
```python
print(max(abs(x - c[0]), abs(x - c[k-1])))
```

Given the above, the output will be the maximum of the absolute differences between `x` (the single element in `a`) and the largest and smallest elements in `c`.

Output: **max(abs(x - c[0]), abs(x - c[k-1]))** (where `x` is the single element in list `a` and `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order).
