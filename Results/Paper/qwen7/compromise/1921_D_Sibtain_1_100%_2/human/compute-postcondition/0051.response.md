Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 4, `ans` is the sum of all `max(t1, t2)` values calculated during each iteration, `k` is 3, `t1` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[0] - c[1])`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from user input, `c` is a list of integers created from user input.**

Explanation: The code `c = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts them into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `c`. The values of `i`, `j`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
