Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the closest city for each city and using this information to answer queries about the minimum cost to travel between any two cities.
2. The provided program includes a function `func_1` that correctly computes the closest city distances for each city except the first and last, which are set to zero as expected.
3. The main part of the program processes test cases, reverses the city list to compute backward distances, and uses prefix sums to efficiently answer queries.
4. The logic for handling queries is correct: it uses the prefix sums computed from the forward and backward closest city distances to determine the minimum cost between any two cities.
5. There are no apparent errors in the logic or implementation that would cause incorrect results based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct according to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
