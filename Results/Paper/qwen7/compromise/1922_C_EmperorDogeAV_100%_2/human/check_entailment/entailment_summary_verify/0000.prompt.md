You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
    return prog_cities



- Function Summary: 
Functionality: The function accepts a list of city coordinates `cities` and its length `n`. It calculates and returns a new list `prog_cities` where each element (except the first and last) represents the smallest absolute difference between the coordinate of the city at that index and the nearest neighbor's coordinate. The first and last elements of `prog_cities` remain zero because there is no previous city for the first element and no next city for the last element.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the closest city for each city. The `func_1` function is supposed to determine the closest city for each city based on the given criteria, but it does not correctly calculate the closest city. Instead, it seems to be calculating the distance to the next and previous cities and choosing the smaller distance, which does not necessarily give the closest city based on the problem description.

For example, consider the cities located in points `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`. According to the problem description, the closest city to city 1 is city 2, to city 2 is city 3, to city 3 is city 4, to city 4 is city 3, and to city 5 is city 4. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly identify these closest cities. It calculates the distances to the next and previous cities and chooses the smaller distance, which does not always give the correct closest city.

Here is an example to illustrate the issue:
- For city 1, the distances to the next and previous cities are `8` and `0`, respectively. The function would choose `0`, which is incorrect because the closest city is actually city 2.
- For city 3, the distances to the next and previous cities are `15 - 12 = 3` and `12 - 8 = 4`, respectively. The function would choose `3`, which is correct, but for city 4, the distances are `20 - 15 = 5` and `15 - 12 = 3`, and the function would choose `5`, which is incorrect because the closest city is city 3.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the closest city for each city, making it incorrect.
