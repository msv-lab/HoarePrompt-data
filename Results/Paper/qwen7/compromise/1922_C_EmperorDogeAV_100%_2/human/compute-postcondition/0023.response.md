Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `back` is -99999999999999999999, `forward` is 999999999999999999**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `forward` to `999999999999999999`. The values of `i` and `back` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `forward` is now explicitly set to `999999999999999999`, overriding its previous value which was supposed to be `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`.
