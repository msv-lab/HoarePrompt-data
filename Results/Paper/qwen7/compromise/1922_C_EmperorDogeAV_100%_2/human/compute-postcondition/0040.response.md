Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`, `forward` is now `cities[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `forward` to be `cities[i + 1]`. The values of `i` and `back` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `i` is incremented by 1, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`, and `forward` is now `cities[i + 1]`.
