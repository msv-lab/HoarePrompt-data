Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `back` is updated to `cities[i - 1]`, `forward` is either `cities[i + 1]` (if `i < n - 1`) or remains `999999999999999999` (if `i >= n - 1`), `prog_cities[i]` is the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` and assigns it to `prog_cities[i]`. The values of `i`, `back`, and `forward` remain as per their previous states unless they are explicitly modified by the current line of code. Since no new values are assigned to `i`, `back`, or `forward` in this line, their states remain unchanged except for the implicit conditions related to `forward`.
