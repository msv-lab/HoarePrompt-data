Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and for each node `u` in the range [1, n], `nodes[u]` contains a list of all nodes `v` that are directly connected to `u` by an edge, formed from the input during the loop iterations.
