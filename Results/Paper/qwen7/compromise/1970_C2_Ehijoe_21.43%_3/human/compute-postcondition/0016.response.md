Postcondition: `moves` is the result of the function call `func_1(nodes, start)`, `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing (u, v) pairs for each edge entered during the loop, `start` is an integer equal to the input integer, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and each key in `nodes` corresponds to a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes based on the edges provided, `leaves` is a deque() instance containing all the leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one adjacent node) from the graph, and all moves in `moves` are even numbers.
