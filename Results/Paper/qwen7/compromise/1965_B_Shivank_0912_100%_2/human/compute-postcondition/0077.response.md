Output State: **`j` is 20, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is [1048576, 1048576]**.

Explanation: Initially, `j` is 20, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` contains the value 1048576 (which is \(1 << 20\)). The code snippet `ans.append(1 << j)` appends the value of \(1 << j\) to the list `ans`. Since \(j\) is 20, \(1 << j\) is \(1 << 20\), which is 1048576. This value is already present in `ans`, so it appends another 1048576 to the list. Therefore, the updated state of `ans` is a list containing two elements, both of which are 1048576.
