Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Understanding `k`:**
   - `k` must be at least \(2^i\), where \(i\) is the highest power of 2 such that \(2^i \leq k\).
   - This means `k` is a power of 2 itself, specifically \(2^{20}\) because the sequence includes \(1 << 19\) (which is \(2^{19}\)) and higher powers up to \(1 << 19\) (which is \(2^{19}\)).

2. **Constructing the `ans` list:**
   - The list `ans` contains several elements:
     - \(k - (1 << i)\): Since \(i = 19\), this becomes \(k - 2^{19}\).
     - \(k + 1\): This is simply \(k + 1\).
     - \(k + 1 + (1 << i)\): This becomes \(k + 1 + 2^{19}\).
     - \(1\): This is just the number 1.
     - \(1 << 1\): This is \(2^1 = 2\).
     - \(1 << 3\): This is \(2^3 = 8\).
     - ...
     - \(1 << 19\): This is \(2^{19}\).

3. **Values in the `ans` list:**
   - Let \(k = 2^{20} = 1048576\).
   - The list `ans` will be:
     \[
     [1048576 - 2^{19}, 1048577, 1048576 + 2^{19}, 1, 2, 8, \ldots, 524288]
     \]
   - Simplifying the first element:
     \[
     1048576 - 2^{19} = 1048576 - 524288 = 524288
     \]

4. **Printing the list:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

Given the above steps, the output will be:

Output: **524288 1048577 1099012 1 2 8 32 128 512 2048 8192 32768 131072 524288 2097152 8388608 33554432 134217728 536870912 2147483648**
