Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `tc` and the value `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `tc`**: The loop starts with `tc` being set to 0 because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`.

3. **Determine the Value of `t`**: The value of `t` is given as the result of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. If `t` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to start executing. The initial state of `tc` is not relevant since it will be set to 0 by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
**`t` must be at least 1**
