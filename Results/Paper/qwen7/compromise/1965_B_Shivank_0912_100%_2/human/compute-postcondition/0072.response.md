Output State: **`j` is 19, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` contains the value 524288 (which is 1 << 19)**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Since `j` is 19, `1 << j` results in `524288`. The value of `j` remains 19, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 0. The list `ans` now contains the appended value.
