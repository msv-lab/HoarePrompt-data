Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head in the given code is `for tc in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `tc` and `t`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ans` is a list containing `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 1 << 1, 1 << 3, ..., 1 << 19]`.
   - `j` is 19.
   - `i` is the highest power of 2 such that \(2^i \leq k\).
   - `k` must be at least \(2^i\).

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `for tc in range(t)`, which means the loop will continue as long as `tc < t`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `tc` would be `t-1` because the loop starts from `0` and goes up to `t-1`.
   - For the next iteration, `tc` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes `t`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `tc`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`ans` is a list containing `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 1 << 1, 1 << 3, ..., 1 << 19]`, where `j` is 19 and `i` is the highest power of 2 such that \(2^i \leq k\) and `k` must be at least \(2^i\), `tc` is `t`**.
