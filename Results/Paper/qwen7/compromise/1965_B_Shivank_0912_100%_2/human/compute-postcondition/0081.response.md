Output State: **`j` is 20; `n` must be greater than or equal to 0; `ans` is [1048576, 10485760].**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(1 << j)` appends the value of `1 << j` (which is `1 << 20` or `10485760`) to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains the value `1048576`. After appending `10485760`, `ans` becomes `[1048576, 10485760]`. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged.
