Output State: **The list `ans` will contain all integers from 1048576 to 1048575 * 2^19, and `j` will be 20.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop completes all 20 iterations, the variable `j` will have incremented to 20. The variable `ans` will have appended `1 << j` (which is equivalent to multiplying 1048576 by \(2^j\)) for each `j` from 0 to 19, inclusive. This means `ans` will contain the values 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, ..., up to 1048575 * 2^19. The value of `i`, `tc`, `n`, and `k` will remain unchanged from their initial states.
