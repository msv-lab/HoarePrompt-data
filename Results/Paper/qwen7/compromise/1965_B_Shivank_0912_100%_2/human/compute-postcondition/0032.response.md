Output State: **`ans` is a list containing `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 1 << 1, 1 << 3, ..., 1 << 19]`, `i` is 0, `tc` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is initialized to 0. All other variables (`ans`, `tc`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
