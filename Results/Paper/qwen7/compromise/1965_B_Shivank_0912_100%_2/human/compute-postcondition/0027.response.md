Output State: **`ans` is a list containing `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 1 << 1, 1 << 3, ..., 1 << 19]`, where `j` is 19 and `i` is the highest power of 2 such that \(2^i \leq k\) and `k` must be at least \(2^i\).**

In Natural Language: After the loop executes all 20 iterations, the list `ans` will contain the initial elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` followed by the powers of 2 from \(2^1\) to \(2^{19}\) that were appended during each iteration of the loop. The variable `j` will have the value 19, which is the last value it takes within the loop. The value of `i` will be the highest power of 2 such that \(2^i \leq k\) and `k` must be at least \(2^i\).
