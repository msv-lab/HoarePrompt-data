Output State: `ans` contains all integers from `1` to `1048576`, except for `1 << i`, `j` is `19`, `i` is `20`, `tc` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is `1048576`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`. Given that `k` remains `1048576` throughout the loop, the loop will continue to increment `i` until `1 << i + 1` exceeds `1048576`. Since `1 << 20` equals `1048576`, the loop will execute until `i` reaches `20`. After the loop completes, `i` will be `20`, and `ans` will still exclude the value `1 << i`, which is `1048576`. All other variables (`j`, `tc`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
