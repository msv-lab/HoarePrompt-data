Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. The values of `n` and `k` remain undefined, and the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    i = 0
    while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
        i = i + 1
    ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
    for j in range(20):
        if j != i:
            ans.append(1 << j)
    print(len(ans))
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is a list containing `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 1 << 1, 1 << 3, ..., 1 << 19]`, where `j` is 19 and `i` is the highest power of 2 such that \(2^i \leq k\) and `k` must be at least \(2^i\).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The list `ans` will contain all integers from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19`, except for `1 << i`. The variable `j` will be 19 after the loop completes, `i` will remain as 20, `tc` will still be `t`, `n` will remain unchanged as the input integer, and `k` will still be 1048576.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The list `ans` will contain all integers from 1048576 to 1048575 * 2^19, and `j` will be 20.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
