Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The list `ans` contains all integers from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19`, except for `1 << i`.
   - `1 << 0` is 1.
   - `1 << 19` is 524288.
   - So, `ans` contains all integers from 1 to 524288, excluding one specific integer `1 << i`.

2. The variable `i` remains as 20 after the loop completes.
   - This means that the integer `1 << 20` is excluded from the list `ans`.
   - `1 << 20` is 1048576.

3. The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements in the list `ans` separated by a space.

Given this information, the list `ans` will contain all integers from 1 to 524288, excluding 1048576.

Output: **1 2 3 ... 1048575 1048577 1048578 ... 524288**
