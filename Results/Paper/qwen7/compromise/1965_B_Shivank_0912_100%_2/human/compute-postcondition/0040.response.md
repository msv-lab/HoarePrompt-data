Output State: `ans` is a list containing `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 1 << 1, 1 << 3, ..., 1 << 19]`, `i` is 20, `tc` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, and `k` must be at least 1048576.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as \(1 << i + 1 \leq k\). Starting from `i = 0`, the loop increments `i` until it reaches the maximum value where \(1 << i + 1\) is still less than or equal to `k`. Given that the loop executed 3 times with `i` reaching 4, we can infer that `k` must be at least \(2^{20}\) (which is 1048576) for the loop to continue executing until `i` is 20. At this point, the loop condition \(1 << i + 1 \leq k\) will no longer hold true because \(1 << 21\) (which is 2097152) exceeds `k`. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be 20.
