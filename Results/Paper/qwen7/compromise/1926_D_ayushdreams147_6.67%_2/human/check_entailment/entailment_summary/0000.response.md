Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic implemented in the `func_1` function aligns with the problem statement and the desired outcome.

### Problem Analysis:
- The goal is to divide the numbers into groups such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value at any position from 1 to 31.
- The solution uses the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to transform each number. This operation flips all the bits of the number, effectively making the problem equivalent to finding the minimum number of groups needed to ensure that no two numbers have the same bit pattern after flipping.

### Function Analysis:
- The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `a` and the length `n` of the list.
- It initializes a counter `res` to keep track of the number of groups required.
- A dictionary `count` is used to count the occurrences of transformed numbers.
- For each number in the list, it checks if the transformed number (using `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`) is already in the dictionary:
  - If not, it increments the count for the transformed number and increases the group count (`res`).
  - If it is already in the dictionary, it decrements the count for that number.

### Verification:
1. **Bitwise Operation**: The operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` indeed flips all the bits of the number, which is a valid transformation to check for the required condition.
2. **Group Counting**: The logic correctly counts the number of unique transformed numbers, which corresponds to the minimum number of groups needed.
3. **Dictionary Usage**: The dictionary `count` ensures that only unique transformed numbers are counted, and duplicates are handled appropriately by decrementing the count.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic matches the requirements of the problem, and the function `func_1` correctly computes the minimum number of groups needed.

Correctness: **True**
