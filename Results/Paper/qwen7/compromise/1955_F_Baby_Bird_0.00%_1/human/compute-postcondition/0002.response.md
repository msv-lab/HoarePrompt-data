Output State: The output state is a series of integers representing the result of the loop for each test case. For each test case, the output is calculated as follows: 
1. Read a line of input and split it into four integers, which represent the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.
2. For each integer in the first three positions (counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s), if it is odd, it contributes 1 to a counter; otherwise, it contributes 0. If all three of these counters sum to 3, then add 1 to another counter; otherwise, do nothing.
3. Add half of the sum of the four integers (integer division) to the previous counter.
4. Print the final value of the counter for each test case.

In summary, the output state is a list of integers where each integer represents the computed value for each respective test case based on the rules described above.
