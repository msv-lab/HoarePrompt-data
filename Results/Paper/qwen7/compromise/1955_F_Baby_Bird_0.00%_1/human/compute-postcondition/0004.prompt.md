You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state is a series of integers representing the result of the loop for each test case. For each test case, the output is calculated as follows: 
    #1. Read a line of input and split it into four integers, which represent the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.
    #2. For each integer in the first three positions (counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s), if it is odd, it contributes 1 to a counter; otherwise, it contributes 0. If all three of these counters sum to 3, then add 1 to another counter; otherwise, do nothing.
    #3. Add half of the sum of the four integers (integer division) to the previous counter.
    #4. Print the final value of the counter for each test case.
    #
    #In summary, the output state is a list of integers where each integer represents the computed value for each respective test case based on the rules described above.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively, and returns a value based on these counts.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
