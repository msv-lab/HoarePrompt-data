Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.
2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `n` is the upper limit of the range function, which is `t + 1` (since `range(t + 1)` generates numbers from 0 to t).

3. **Understand the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be set to 0 because it is the initial value before the loop starts.
   - `n` should be set to `t + 1` because the loop will run from `0` to `t`.

5. **Consider Other Variables**:
   - `possible` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `b` and `c` are also not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is `t + 1`**
