Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is `t + 1`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `possible` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then no specific changes are made beyond the initial precondition. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
