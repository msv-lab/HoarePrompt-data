Output State: **The loop has executed all iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `n-1`. The value of `possible` is either True or False based on the conditions within the loop. If at any point during the loop execution, the condition `c[i] != a[i]` was met without `c[i]` being equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` would be set to True and the loop would break. If the loop completes without setting `possible` to True, it remains False.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`. The variable `possible` will be True if there was any index `i` where `c[i]` was neither equal to `a[i]` nor `b[i]` when `a[i]` was equal to `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` will be False.
