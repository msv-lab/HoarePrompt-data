Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, converts it into a string, and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The variable `n` is mentioned as an input integer in the initial state but is not directly involved in the operation of the given code. The new variable `a` is assigned the stripped input string.
