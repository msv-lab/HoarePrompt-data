Output State: **`i` is `n + t`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True`**.

Explanation: The line `possible = True` sets the variable `possible` to `True`. No other changes are made to the variables `i`, `n`, or `t`. Therefore, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `t` is still a part of the expression for `i`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 and the definition of `possible` remain valid.
