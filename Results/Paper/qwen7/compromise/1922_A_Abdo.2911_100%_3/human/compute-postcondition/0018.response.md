Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, the elements at index `i` of arrays `a` and `b` are not equal, and the value of `c[0]` is either equal to `a[0]` or `b[0]`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified within the statement itself, the values of `i`, `n`, the elements at index `i` of arrays `a` and `b`, and the value of `c[0]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
