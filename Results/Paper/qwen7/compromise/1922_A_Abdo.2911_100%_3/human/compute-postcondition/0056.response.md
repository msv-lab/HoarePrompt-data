Postcondition: **`possible` is either True or False. If `possible` is True, it means that at least once during the loop, the condition `c[i] != a[i]` was met without `c[i]` being equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If `possible` is False, it means that for all `i` from 0 to `n-2`, `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.**
