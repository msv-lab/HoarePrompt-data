Output State: **`possible` is True, `i` is `n - 1 + t`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is False, `c` is an input string from user input, and the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `b[i]`**.

Explanation: The line `possible = True` changes the value of the variable `possible` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
