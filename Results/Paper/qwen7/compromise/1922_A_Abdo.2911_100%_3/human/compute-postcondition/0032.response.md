Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop specified in the initial state or the code snippet, the implication is that the loop containing `continue` is understood to be the context. Given that `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer, these values remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
