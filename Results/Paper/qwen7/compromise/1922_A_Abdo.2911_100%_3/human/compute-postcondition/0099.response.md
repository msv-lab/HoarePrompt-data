Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is `t + 1`.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
