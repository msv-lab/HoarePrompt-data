Output State: **`i` is `n + t + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `possible` is `True`**.

Explanation: The line `possible = True` sets the variable `possible` to `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `possible` is now explicitly set to `True`.
