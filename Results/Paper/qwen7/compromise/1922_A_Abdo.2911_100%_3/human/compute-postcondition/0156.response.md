Output State: **`i` is `n + t + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `possible` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `possible`. It only indicates that the execution breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, we assume it breaks out of an implicit loop or conditional context that was present in the initial state but not shown in the code snippet.
