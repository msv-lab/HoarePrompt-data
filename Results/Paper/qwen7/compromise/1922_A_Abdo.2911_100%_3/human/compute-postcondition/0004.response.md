Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` reads a line of input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
