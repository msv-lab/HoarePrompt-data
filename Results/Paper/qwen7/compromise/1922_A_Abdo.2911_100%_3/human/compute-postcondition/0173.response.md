Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, `i` is `n - 1 + t`, `n` is the final value of `t + (n-1) * (number of iterations)`, and `possible` is either `True` or `False`.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to `n - 1 + t`, where `t` is the initial value of `t` (the number of iterations), and `n` is the final value of `n` after all iterations, which is the sum of the initial `t` and the maximum `n` value encountered during the iterations. The variable `possible` will be `True` if there was at least one instance where `c[i] != a[i]` and `c[i]` was neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` for any `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, `possible` will be `False`.
