Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000, `t` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(max)` appends the value of `max` (which is 100000000) to the list `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans` now contains the single element 100000000.
