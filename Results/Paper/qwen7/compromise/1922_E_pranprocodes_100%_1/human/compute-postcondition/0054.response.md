Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000, `t` is 0.**

The code `max -= 1` decrements the value of `max` by 1. Initially, `max` was set to 100000000, so after executing the code, `max` becomes 99999999. All other variables remain unchanged.
