Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99989999, `ans` is a list containing -100000000, `t` is 1**

Explanation: The code `x -= 1` subtracts 1 from the value of `x`. Since `x` was originally an input integer greater than 1, after subtracting 1, `x` becomes an input integer greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
