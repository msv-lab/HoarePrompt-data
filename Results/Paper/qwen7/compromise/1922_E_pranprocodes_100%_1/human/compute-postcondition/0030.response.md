Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is 0, `max` is 99999899, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing [99999899], `t` is 1**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `max` (which is 99999899) to the list `ans`. The list `ans` was initially containing one element, which is 99999999. After appending, `ans` now contains two elements: 99999999 and 99999899. The values of `i`, `x`, `min`, and `t` remain unchanged.
