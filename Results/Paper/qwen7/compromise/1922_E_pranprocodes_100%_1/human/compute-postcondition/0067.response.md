Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing -100000000, `t` is 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Since the initial value of `min` is -99999999, the updated `ans` list now contains -100000000. All other variables remain unchanged.
