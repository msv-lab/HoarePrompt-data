Output State: `t` is the minimum number of steps required to reduce `x` to 1 by repeatedly dividing by 2 when `x` is even and decrementing by 1 when `x` is odd, `i` is the number of test cases which is the same as the number of iterations of the loop, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - `t`, `min` is -100000000 + `t`, `ans` is a list containing `max - t` repeated when `x` was even and `-100000000 + t` repeated when `x` was odd during the iterations, and `ans` has been reversed.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will hold the total number of operations needed to reduce `x` to 1, starting from any valid `x` value within the given constraints. The list `ans` will contain the sequence of values that `max` and `min` took on during the process, in reverse order, with `max` decreasing and `min` increasing as `x` is divided or decremented towards 1.
