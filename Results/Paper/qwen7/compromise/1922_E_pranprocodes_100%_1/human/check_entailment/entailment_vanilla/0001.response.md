### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, `X`. The program should output the length of the array and the array itself. If it's not possible to construct such an array, it should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program takes an integer `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `x` representing the desired number of increasing subsequences.
   - The program attempts to construct an array with the required number of increasing subsequences using a while loop.
   - Inside the loop, it alternates between appending the maximum and minimum values within the allowed range to the array `ans`.
   - It adjusts the `max` and `min` values accordingly and divides `x` by 2 when `x` is even, otherwise it subtracts 1 from `x`.
   - After constructing the array, it prints its length and the array itself.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic seems to be attempting to construct the array by ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences matches the given `x`.
   - However, the approach used in the program does not correctly guarantee the construction of an array with exactly `x` increasing subsequences. Specifically, the method of alternating between the maximum and minimum values does not ensure the correct count of increasing subsequences.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider `x = 3`. The program will append `max` and `min` values, but this does not necessarily result in exactly 3 increasing subsequences. For instance, the array `[100000000, -100000000, 100000000]` would have more than 3 increasing subsequences.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It does not guarantee that the constructed array will have exactly `x` increasing subsequences.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not ensure that the generated array will have exactly `x` increasing subsequences.
