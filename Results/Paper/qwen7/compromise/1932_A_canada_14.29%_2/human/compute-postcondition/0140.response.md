Output State: **`thorn` is 0, `ret` is either 2 or 2, `s` is a list that must have at least one element, `i` is an element of `s` and `i` is not `'@'`.**

Explanation: The value of `ret` is incremented by 1, so if `ret` was initially 0, it becomes 1, and if `ret` was initially 1, it becomes 2. The values of `thorn`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.
