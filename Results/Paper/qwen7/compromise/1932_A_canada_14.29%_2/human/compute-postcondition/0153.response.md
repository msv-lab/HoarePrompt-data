Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines of input. Each line starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) indicating the length of the string, and then a string of `n` characters consisting only of '.', '@', and '*', where '.' represents an empty cell, '@' represents a cell with a coin, and '*' represents a cell with thorns. The function returns the count of cells with coins ('@') for each test case.**
