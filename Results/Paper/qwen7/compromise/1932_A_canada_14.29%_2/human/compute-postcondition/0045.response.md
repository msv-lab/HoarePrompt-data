Output State: `thorn` is a value between 0 and 3 inclusive, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer determined by the length of the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that has been fully processed, `ret` is the total count of '@' characters encountered, and `i` is the last character in the list `s`.

In this final state, `thorn` will reflect the last encountered character type (0 for any character other than '@' or '*', 1 for '@', and 2 for '*') unless a '*' causes an early exit from the loop. The variable `ret` will contain the total count of '@' characters found in the input string during the loop's execution.
