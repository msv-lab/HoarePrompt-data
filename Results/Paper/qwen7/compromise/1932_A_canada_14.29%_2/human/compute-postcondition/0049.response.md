Output State: **`thorn` is a value between 0 and 3 inclusive, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the input integer minus 1, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that has been fully iterated over, `ret` is the count of '@' characters encountered, and `i` is the last character in the list `s`, `len` is assigned the value `int(input())**.

The code `len = int(input())` assigns the value of the integer input to the variable `len`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
