Postcondition: `thorn` is either 0 or 2; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer determined by the length of the input; `s` is a list of characters with at least two characters remaining; `ret` is 0; `i` is the next character in the list `s`. If `thorn` equals 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; otherwise, `thorn` is set to 0.
