Output State: **`thorn` is 0, `ret` is 0, `s` is a list that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `s`, and the current value of `i` is '@'**

The code `thorn = 0` simply reassigns the value of `thorn` to 0, which does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `ret`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
