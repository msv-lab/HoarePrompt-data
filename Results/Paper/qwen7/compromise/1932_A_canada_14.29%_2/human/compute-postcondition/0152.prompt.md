Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of input is a string of n characters consisting only of '.', '@', and '*', where '.' represents an empty cell, '@' represents a cell with a coin, and '*' represents a cell with thorns. Additionally, the first cell is guaranteed to be empty ('.') and does not contain thorns.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    len = int(input())
    s = list(input())
    ret = 0
    thorn = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '@':
            thorn = 0
            ret += 1
        elif i == '*':
            thorn += 1
            if thorn == 2:
                break
        else:
            thorn == 0
    print(ret)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `thorn` is a value between 0 and 3 inclusive, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer determined by the length of the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that has been fully iterated over, `ret` is the count of '@' characters encountered, and `i` is the last character in the list `s`.

In this final state, `thorn` will reflect the last value it held during the loop execution, which could be 0, 1, 2, or 3 based on the characters encountered. If any '*' was encountered and `thorn` was 0, it would increment `thorn` to 2, breaking out of the loop. The variable `ret` will hold the total count of '@' characters found in the string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All characters in the list `s` have been processed, `thorn` is either 0 or 2 depending on whether any '*' characters were encountered, and `ret` is the count of '@' characters found in the list `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `thorn` is either 0 or 1, `ret` is between 0 and 3 inclusive, `s` is a list that has been fully iterated over, and `i` is the last element of `s` or does not exist if `s` is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
