Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and for each iteration of the loop, `n` is an integer read from input, `nums` is a list of integers read from input and split, and the output is the result of `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]`. After all iterations, the value of `t` remains the same, but the values of `n` and `nums` change with each iteration based on user input.
