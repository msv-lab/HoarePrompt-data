Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by taking the maximum value from the first \(n-1\) books and adding it to the last book's value. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum total number of pages Alice can read. To achieve the maximum total, we need to ensure that the largest book is placed in a different pile than the second-largest book. This way, Alice can read both the largest and the second-largest books.

The current implementation only considers the sum of the maximum of the first \(n-1\) books and the last book. This does not account for the possibility that the second-largest book might be among the first \(n-1\) books, which would result in a smaller total.

To correctly solve the problem, we should:
1. Find the two largest books.
2. Place them in different piles.
3. Sum their values to get the maximum total number of pages Alice can read.

Given the current logic, the program is incorrect because it does not always produce the optimal solution.

Correctness: **False**
