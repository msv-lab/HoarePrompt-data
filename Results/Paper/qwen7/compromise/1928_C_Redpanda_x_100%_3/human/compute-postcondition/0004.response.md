Output State: **`prime` is the k-th prime number in the list of primes, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, and k is not equal to the length of the list of primes; `rest` is the result of calling `generate(k + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the k-th prime number from the list of primes to the variable `prime`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `k`, and `rest` remain unchanged from their initial states.
