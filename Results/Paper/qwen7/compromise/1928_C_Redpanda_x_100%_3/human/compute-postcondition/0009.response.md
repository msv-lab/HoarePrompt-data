Output State: **`prime_to_i` is multiplied by `prime`.**

In this case, the code multiplies `prime_to_i` by `prime`. The initial state tells us that `prime_to_i` is generated and yielded, and now it is updated to be `prime_to_i` times `prime`. The value of `factors[prime]` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the operation.
