Output State: **`prime_to_i` is now `prime_to_i * prime * prime`, `rest` is the list without its first two elements, `factor` is the second element of the modified `rest` list, `factors[prime]` must be at least 2, and `prime_to_i` is updated to `prime_to_i * prime**.

Explanation: The line `prime_to_i *= prime` updates the value of `prime_to_i` by multiplying it with `prime`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
