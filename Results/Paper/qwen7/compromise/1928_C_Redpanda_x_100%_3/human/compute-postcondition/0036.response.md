Output State: **`prime_to_i` is now `prime_to_i * prime`, `rest` is the list without its first two elements, `factor` is the second element of the modified `rest` list, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, and `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.**

Explanation: The value of `prime_to_i` is updated to be its current value multiplied by `prime`. The other variables (`rest`, `factor`, and the condition on `factors[prime]`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
