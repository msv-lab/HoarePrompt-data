Output State: **`prime_to_i` is `factor * prime_to_i * prime`, `rest` is the list without its first element, and `factor` is the first element of `rest`.**

Explanation: The code multiplies `prime_to_i` by `prime`. The value of `prime_to_i` was originally `factor * prime_to_i`. After multiplying by `prime`, the new value of `prime_to_i` becomes `factor * prime_to_i * prime`. The values of `rest` and `factor` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
