Output State: **`prime_to_i` is `factor * prime_to_i * prime`, `rest` is the list without its first element, `factor` is the first element of `rest`, `factors[prime]` is incremented by 1, and `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.**

Explanation: The code `yield factor * prime_to_i` yields the value of `factor * prime_to_i`. This does not change the values of the other variables, but it indicates that the value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded. The other variables (`prime_to_i`, `rest`, `factor`, and `factors[prime]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
