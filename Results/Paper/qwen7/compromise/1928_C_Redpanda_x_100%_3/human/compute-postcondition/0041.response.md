Output State: **`prime_to_i` is now `prime_to_i * prime * prime`, `rest` is the list without its first two elements, `factor` is the second element of the modified `rest` list, `factors[prime]` must be at least 2, and `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.**

Explanation: The code `yield factor * prime_to_i` yields the value of `factor * prime_to_i`. This does not assign the value back to any variable but rather returns it. The values of the other variables (`prime_to_i`, `rest`, `factor`, and `factors[prime]`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The output state includes the fact that `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.
