You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: The `factors` dictionary contains the complete prime factorization of the original number `n` with their respective counts; `i` is greater than the largest prime factor of `n`; and `nn` is 1.
    if (nn > 1) :
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    #State: The `factors` dictionary now includes an entry for `nn` with its count incremented by 1, provided `nn` is greater than 1. If `nn` is not greater than 1, the dictionary remains unchanged.
    primes = list(factors.keys())
    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and `factor` contains the last value produced by the generator `generate(0)`, which is 2, and it has been yielded.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `factor` holds the value 2, which is the last value generated by the `generate(0)` function, and this value has been yielded.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter n, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9. It returns a specific value based on the input n.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
