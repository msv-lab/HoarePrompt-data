Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `prime` is the k-th prime number in the list of primes, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, and k is not equal to the length of the list of primes; `rest` is the result of calling `generate(k + 1)`
Code of the loop:
for factor in rest:
    prime_to_i = 1
    for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
        yield factor * prime_to_i
        prime_to_i *= prime


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `prime_to_i` will be equal to `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1`, and `factor` will be equal to `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime]`. The variable `factors[prime]` will be decremented to 0 after the loop finishes executing all its iterations.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `prime_to_i` will hold the value of `prime` multiplied by itself as many times as specified in the initial `factors[prime]` value plus one additional multiplication. Meanwhile, `factor` will hold the value of `prime` multiplied by itself as many times as specified in the initial `factors[prime]` value. The `factors[prime]` dictionary entry will be set to 0, indicating that `prime` has been fully processed in the context of the loop's operations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `prime_to_i` is `factor * prime_to_i * prime * prime`, `rest` is the list without its first element, `factor` is the first element of `rest`, `factors[prime]` is incremented by 3, and no new value is yielded.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `prime_to_i` will be updated by multiplying it with `prime` three times (as per the given pattern), making it `factor * prime_to_i * prime * prime`. The `rest` list remains unchanged as no elements are added or removed from it other than the initial assumption. The `factor` variable is updated to the first element of the modified `rest` list, and `factors[prime]` is incremented by 3 since the loop runs `factors[prime] + 1` times and `factors[prime]` was initially incremented by 1 before the loop started. No new value is yielded as the loop completes its iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `prime_to_i` is now `prime_to_i * prime ** (factors[prime] + 1)`, `rest` is the list without its first two elements, `factor` is the second element of the modified `rest` list, `factors[prime]` must be at least 2, and `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded after each iteration.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `prime_to_i` will be equal to its initial value multiplied by `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1`. The `rest` list remains unchanged except for the removal of its first two elements. The `factor` variable is set to the second element of the modified `rest` list. The condition on `factors[prime]` is that it must be at least 2. After each iteration of the loop, the value `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
