Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9.** 

Note that the provided function `generate` does not seem to be related to solving the problem described in the input and output sections. It appears to be a separate function that might be used elsewhere, possibly for generating combinations or products involving prime factors, but it is not directly relevant to the main problem of determining the number of valid k values for a given n and x.
