Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, the string `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `win`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state includes all the original conditions and the new condition that `win` is an empty set.
