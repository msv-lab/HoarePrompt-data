Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1` is never called correctly**: The function `func_1` is defined but never called properly within the main loop. The variable `func_1` is assigned a value, which is not what was intended.

2. **Random Number Generation**: The random number generation part (`rrr = randint(8888, 88888)`) is unnecessary and should be removed.

3. **Logic for Checking Subsequences**: The logic for checking subsequences is flawed. The current implementation checks if all characters from the alphabet are present in the string `s` in sequence but does not ensure that all possible combinations of length `n` are subsequences.

4. **Generating a Non-Subsequence String**: The code for generating a non-subsequence string is incorrect. It simply appends an extra character 'a' at the end, which might not always result in a valid non-subsequence string.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []

    # Check if all possible strings of length n are subsequences
    for i in range(m):
        if s[i] in us:
            win.add(s[i])
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(s[i])
                win.clear()
                if len(ans) == n:
                    break

    if len(ans) == n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        # Generate a non-subsequence string
        missing_chars = ''.join(c for c in us if c not in s)
        if missing_chars:
            print(missing_chars[0] * n)
        else:
            # If no characters are missing, generate a random string
            print(''.join(chr(randint(97, 97 + k - 1)) for _ in range(n)))
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly checks if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences and generates a valid non-subsequence string if necessary.
