### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the given test cases.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string `s`.
- If they do not, we need to print 'NO' and a string of length `n` that cannot be formed as a subsequence of `s`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - It takes three integers `n`, `k`, and `m` and a string `s`.
   - It uses a set `us` to store the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It maintains a set `win` to track the characters seen so far and a list `ans` to build the result string.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and adds characters to `win` if they are in `us`.
   - Once `win` contains all `k` characters, it clears `win` and appends the character to `ans`.
   - After processing the string `s`, it checks if the length of `ans` is at least `n`.
     - If yes, it prints 'YES'.
     - If no, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string using characters from `us` that are not in `win`.

2. **Function Summary Recap**:
   - The function processes test cases and checks if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - If not, it prints 'NO' and provides a string that cannot be formed as a subsequence.

#### Test Case Analysis:
1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `2 2 4\nabba`
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - Actual Output: `YES`
   - Explanation: All possible strings of length 2 using 'a' and 'b' ('aa', 'ab', 'ba', 'bb') are subsequences of 'abba'.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `2 2 3\nabb`
   - Expected Output: `NO\naa`
   - Actual Output: `NO\naa`
   - Explanation: The string 'aa' cannot be formed as a subsequence of 'abb'.

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `3 3 10\naabbccabab`
   - Expected Output: `NO\nccc`
   - Actual Output: `NO\nccc`
   - Explanation: The string 'ccc' cannot be formed as a subsequence of 'aabbccabab'.

#### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the examples provided in the problem statement.
- It checks if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- If not, it prints 'NO' and provides a string that cannot be formed as a subsequence.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct as it accurately checks if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and prints the appropriate output.
