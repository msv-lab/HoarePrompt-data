Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Maximum Subarray Sum**:
   - The code attempts to find the maximum subarray sum using a simple iteration, but it doesn't handle the logic for calculating the maximum possible sum after `k` operations effectively.
   - The variable `maxi` is used to store the maximum subarray sum found so far, but it doesn't account for the fact that we can add multiple copies of the entire array sum or parts of it through the operations.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Final Result**:
   - The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is not correct for the problem. This formula assumes that we can only add the maximum subarray sum `k` times, which is not the optimal strategy.
   - The correct approach involves considering the sum of the array and how adding multiple copies of the array sum can maximize the result.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, you should consider the following steps:

1. **Calculate the Sum of the Array (`total_sum`)**:
   - This is the initial sum of the array before any operations.

2. **Determine the Optimal Strategy**:
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, you can add the entire array sum `k` times, which means the maximum possible sum is `(k * total_sum) % 1000000007`.
   - If `k` is less than `n`, you can add the entire array sum `k` times plus the maximum subarray sum, but you need to ensure that the maximum subarray sum is considered optimally.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the sum of the array
        total_sum = sum(l)
        
        # If k >= n, we can add the entire array sum k times
        if k >= n:
            print((k * total_sum) % MOD)
        else:
            # Find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm
            max_subarray_sum = max_ending_here = l[0]
            for x in l[1:]:
                max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)
                max_subarray_sum = max(max_subarray_sum, max_ending_here)
            
            # Calculate the maximum possible sum
            max_possible_sum = (k * total_sum + max_subarray_sum) % MOD
            print(max_possible_sum)

func()
```

This code uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum and then calculates the maximum possible sum after `k` operations correctly.
