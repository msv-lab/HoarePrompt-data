Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing \( k \) operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The solution provided uses a specific formula to compute the result.

2. **Key Components of the Solution**:
   - The function iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \( n \) and the number of operations \( k \).
   - It then reads the array \( a \).
   - The variable `c` accumulates the sum of elements in the array while checking if the current element is negative and less than the absolute value of `c`. If so, it updates `maxi` and resets `c`.
   - After processing the array, it calculates the result using the formula \( (2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i) \mod 1000000007 \).

3. **Formula Explanation**:
   - The term \( 2^k \times \text{maxi} \) suggests that the maximum possible sum can be achieved by adding the maximum subarray sum multiple times.
   - Subtracting `maxi` ensures that we do not double-count the initial maximum subarray sum.
   - Adding the sum of the array accounts for the original elements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles negative numbers correctly by resetting `c` when necessary.
   - The use of modulo \( 1000000007 \) ensures the result fits within standard integer limits.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - The formula used is appropriate for the problem requirements.
   - The code handles all given constraints and examples accurately.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
