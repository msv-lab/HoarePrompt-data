Output State: **`l` must have at least one integer element, `ele` is the next integer in `l`, `c` is 0, and `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the previous value of `maxi`.**

Explanation: The code sets `c` to 0. Since `c` was previously defined as either 0 or `c + ele`, setting `c` to 0 means that `c` is now explicitly 0. The value of `maxi` remains unchanged because `c` is being set to 0, which does not affect its current maximum value with the previous value of `maxi`. All other variables (`l`, `ele`, and `maxi`) remain in their initial or previous states.
