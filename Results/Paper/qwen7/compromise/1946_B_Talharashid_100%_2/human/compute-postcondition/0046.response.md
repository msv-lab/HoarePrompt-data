Postcondition: `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0, `c` is either `c + ele` or 0, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, and the current value of `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is 0, or `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is greater than `abs(ele)`.
