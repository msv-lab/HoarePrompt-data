Output State: **`maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `c` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. It does not affect the values of `maxi`, `c`, or `i`. The initial state of `maxi` being updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `c` remaining unchanged, and `i` remaining unchanged are preserved. The new values of `n` and `k` are the result of the user's input.
