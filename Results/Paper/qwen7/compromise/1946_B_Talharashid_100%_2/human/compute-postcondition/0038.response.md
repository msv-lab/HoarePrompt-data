Output State: **`maxi` is 0, `c` is 0, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input from the user, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code simply initializes `maxi` to 0. Since `maxi` was previously updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, and `c` is 0, `maxi` remains 0. The values of `c`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l` are not affected by this line of code.
