Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`, `c` is the final accumulated value of `ele` based on the given conditions, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and `l` is an empty list since all elements have been processed.**

This means that `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (`maxi`) and the current value of `c`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
