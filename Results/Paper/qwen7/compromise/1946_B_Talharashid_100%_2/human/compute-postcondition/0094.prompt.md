Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. The array a is a list of integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each element a_i in the array.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = 0
    maxi = 0
    for ele in l:
        if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
            maxi = max(c, maxi)
            c = 0
        else:
            c += ele
            maxi = max(c, maxi)
    maxi = max(c, maxi)
    print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `c` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`, `c` is the final accumulated value of `ele` based on the given conditions, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and `l` is an empty list since all elements have been processed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`, and `ele` remains as the last element of the list `l`, `c` remains as the final accumulated value based on the conditions in the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
