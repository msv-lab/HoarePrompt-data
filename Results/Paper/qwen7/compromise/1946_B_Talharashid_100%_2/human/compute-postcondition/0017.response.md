Output State: **`l` must have at least one integer element, `ele` is the next integer in `l`, `c` is either 0 or `c + ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`. `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.**

Explanation: The line `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates `maxi` to be the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`. The other variables (`l`, `ele`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
