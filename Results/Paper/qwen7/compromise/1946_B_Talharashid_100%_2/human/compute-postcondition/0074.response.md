Output State: **`ele` is an integer, `c` is an integer, and `c` is equal to `ele + c`; `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is initially increased by `ele`, making `c` equal to `ele + c`. The variable `maxi` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `c`. Since the initial value of `maxi` is not specified, it remains as `maxi` being the maximum of `c` (which is now `ele + c`) and the original `maxi`.
