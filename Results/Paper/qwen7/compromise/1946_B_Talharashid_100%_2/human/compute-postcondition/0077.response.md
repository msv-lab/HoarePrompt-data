Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `ele` is an integer.
- `c` is an integer.
- The postcondition states:
  - If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is set to the absolute value of `ele` and `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the previous value of `maxi`.
  - Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele` and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over each element in the list `l`:
```python
for ele in l:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `ele` and `c`.
2. **Determine the Next Value of `ele`**: The next value of `ele` will be the next element from the list `l`.
3. **Determine the Next Value of `c`**: The value of `c` will depend on the condition specified in the postcondition.

### Conditions for the Next Iteration
- If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is set to the absolute value of `ele` and `maxi` is updated accordingly.
- Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele` and `maxi` is updated accordingly.

Since we don't know the exact values of `ele` and `c` from the previous iteration, let's consider both cases:

#### Case 1: `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`
- `c` is set to the absolute value of `ele`.
- `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and the previous value of `maxi`.

#### Case 2: `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`
- `c` is updated to `c + ele`.
- `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.

### Adjusted States for the Next Iteration
- The next value of `ele` will be the next element from the list `l`.
- The next value of `c` will depend on the above conditions.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated values of `ele` and `c` based on the conditions.

### Final Answer
State: **`ele` is an integer (next element from the list `l`), `c` is an integer (updated based on the conditions)**.

To provide a concrete example, if the next element in the list `l` is `5` and the current value of `c` is `3`, then:

- Since `5` is not less than 0, the condition does not apply.
- `c` is updated to `c + 5`, so `c` becomes `8`.
- `maxi` remains unchanged as there was no update to it.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`ele` is 5, `c` is 8**.
