Output State: **`maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `c` is 0, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input from the user, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code sets `c` to 0. This updates the value of `c` but does not affect `maxi`, `i`, `n`, `k`, or `l`. Therefore, the values of `maxi`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l` remain as they were in the initial state, while `c` is now explicitly set to 0.
