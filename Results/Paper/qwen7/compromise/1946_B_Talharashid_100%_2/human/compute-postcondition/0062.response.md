Based on the initial state provided:

- `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`.
- `c` is the final accumulated value of `ele` based on the given conditions.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `l` is an empty list since all elements have been processed.

We need to evaluate the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

Let's break it down:

1. `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`. Since `l` is an empty list, `sum(l)` is 0.
2. `2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)` simplifies to `2 ** k * maxi - maxi + 0`, which further simplifies to `2 ** k * maxi - maxi`.
3. Taking the result modulo `1000000007` gives us the final value to be printed.

Given that `l` is an empty list, the expression simplifies to `2 ** k * maxi - maxi`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **(2 ** k * maxi - maxi) % 1000000007**
