Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `maxi` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, or `c`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
