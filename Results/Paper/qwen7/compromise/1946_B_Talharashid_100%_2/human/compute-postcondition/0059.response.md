Postcondition: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and `maxi`, `c` is updated by adding `ele` to its previous value if `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`. Otherwise, `maxi` remains the same as the original `maxi` and `c` is 0. `i` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining.**
