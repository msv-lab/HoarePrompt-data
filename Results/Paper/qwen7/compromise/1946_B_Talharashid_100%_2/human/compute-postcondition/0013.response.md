Output State: **`l` must have at least one integer element, `ele` is a non-negative integer, `c` is now `c + ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and the previous value of `maxi`.**

Explanation: The variable `maxi` is assigned the maximum value between `c + ele` and its current value. Since `c` was previously greater than `abs(ele)`, adding `ele` to `c` will not change the fact that `c` is greater than `abs(ele)`. The value of `l`, `ele`, and `c` remains unchanged except that `c` is now updated to `c + ele`. The value of `maxi` is updated to reflect the new maximum value between `c + ele` and the previous value of `maxi`.
