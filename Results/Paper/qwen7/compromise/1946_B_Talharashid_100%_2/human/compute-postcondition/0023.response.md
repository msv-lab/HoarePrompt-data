Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `ele` and `l`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `l`. After each iteration, `ele` takes the next integer from the list `l`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `l` must have at least one integer element.
   - `ele` is the next integer in `l`.
   - `c` is either 0 or `c + ele`.
   - `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and the previous value of `maxi`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ele` is the next integer in `l`, after the next iteration, `ele` will be the next integer in `l`.
   - For the loop to continue, `l` must still have at least one integer element.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `l` must still have at least one integer element (since it had at least one before and we are removing one element per iteration).
   - `ele` will be the next integer in `l`.
   - `c` will be updated based on the new value of `ele` (either 0 or `c + ele`).
   - `maxi` will be updated based on the new value of `c + ele` (maximum of `c + ele` and the previous value of `maxi`).

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`l` must have at least two integer elements, `ele` is the next integer in `l`, `c` is either 0 or `c + ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and the previous value of `maxi`.**
