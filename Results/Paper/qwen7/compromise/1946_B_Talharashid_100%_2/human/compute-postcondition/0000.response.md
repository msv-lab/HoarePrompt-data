State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop `for i in range(int(input())):` depends on the value of `int(input())`, which is the input from the user.
- Before the loop starts, `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- The variable `i` is the loop counter initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

Since the loop will run for the number of times specified by `int(input())`, and `t` represents the maximum possible number of iterations (since \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)), the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` starting at 0, and ensuring that the input to `int(input())` is within the range defined by `t`.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect these conditions:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is 0

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0**
