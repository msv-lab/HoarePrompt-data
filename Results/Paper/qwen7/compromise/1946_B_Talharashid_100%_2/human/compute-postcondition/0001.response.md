Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and `i` remains 0. The values of `n` and `k` are the integers entered by the user.
