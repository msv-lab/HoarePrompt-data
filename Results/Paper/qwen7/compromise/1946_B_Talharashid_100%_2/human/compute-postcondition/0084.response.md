Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ele in l:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `ele` and `l`.

2. **Understand the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `ele` is 5
   - `c` is either 0 or 13
   - `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `5`

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `ele` is 5, it will be the first element of the list `l` in the current iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `ele` will change to the next element in the list `l`.
   - The condition for setting `c` is based on the relationship between `ele` and `c`:
     - If `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)`, then `c` is set to 0 and `maxi` remains 8.
     - Otherwise, `c` is set to 13 and `maxi` becomes 13.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `ele` is currently 5 (which is not less than 0), the condition `ele < 0` does not apply.
   - Therefore, `c` will be set to 13 and `maxi` will become 13.
   - `ele` will change to the next element in the list `l`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `ele` will be the next element in the list `l`.
- `c` will be 13.
- `maxi` will be 13.

Since the exact next element in the list `l` is not specified, we can denote it as `next_ele` for generality.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `c` is 13, `maxi` is 13**
