Output State: **`a[i]` is updated to `int(data[index])`, `index` is increased by 1, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] XOR a[i]`, `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing `i`, where `i` is `i_current + 1` and `index` is `index_current + 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to `int(data[index])`. It also increments `index` by 1, calculates `pf[i]` as `pf[i - 1] XOR a[i]`, and updates `mp[pf[i]]` to be a list containing the current value of `i`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
