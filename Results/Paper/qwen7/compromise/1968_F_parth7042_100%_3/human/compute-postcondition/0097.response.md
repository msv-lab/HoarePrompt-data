Output State: **`i` is 3; `pf[i]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`; `index` is increased by 1; `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value 3.**

Explanation: The line `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `mp[pf[i]]`. Since `pf[i]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`, the dictionary `mp` now contains the key `pf[2] ^ a[3]` with the value being a list that includes the number 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
