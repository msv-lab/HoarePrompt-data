The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since no loop was specified, the variables `q`, `l`, `r`, `index`, `x`, and `results` remain unchanged. The `index` is increased by 2, but the exact value of `index` after the increase is not specified in the initial state, so we only know that `index` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`q` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]` and is equal to 0; `results` now contains 'YES'.**
