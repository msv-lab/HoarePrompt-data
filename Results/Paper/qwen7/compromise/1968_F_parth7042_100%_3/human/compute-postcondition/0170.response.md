Output State: **`i` is 1, `a[1]` is int(data[index])**

The code assigns the value of `int(data[index])` to the element `a[1]`. Since `i` was initially set to 1, the assignment `a[i] = int(data[index])` updates the value of `a[1]` to `int(data[index])`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 1 remains valid, but since no operations were performed on `n`, its value is unchanged.
