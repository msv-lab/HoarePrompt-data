Output State: **`q` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it2` is the index of the first occurrence of `r` in `v2` using binary search (bisect_left) - 1; `it1` is greater than or equal to the length of `v1` or `it2` is less than 0 or `v1[it1]` is greater than or equal to `v2[it2]; results` now contains 'NO'**

Explanation: The line `results.append('NO')` appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. This does not change the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `index`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it2`, and `it1` as they were before, while adding `'NO'` to the `results` list.
