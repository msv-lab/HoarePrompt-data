Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 5, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is int(data[index + 1]), `x` is pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1], `v1` is not yet defined, `v2` is not yet defined, `it1` is not yet defined, `it2` is not yet defined, `q` is `q - 1`, `results` contains 'NO' if the conditions for appending 'YES' are not met, otherwise it contains 'YES'**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `pf[r]` XOR `pf[l - 1]` to `x`. Here, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` and `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `results` remains 'NO' unless the conditions for appending 'YES' are met, which are not specified in the given code snippet.
