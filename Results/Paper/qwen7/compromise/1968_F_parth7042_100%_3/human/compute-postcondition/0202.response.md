Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in the sorted list `v1` using binary search; `it2` is the index of `r` in the list `v2` using `bisect_left` minus 1; `it1` is either equal to the length of `v1` or `v1[it1]` is greater than or equal to `v2[it2]`; `results` now contains 'NO'**

Explanation: The line `results.append('NO')` appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. This operation does not affect the values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `index`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, or `it2`. It only adds `'NO'` to the `results` list. Therefore, the conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the updated state includes the new element in the `results` list.
