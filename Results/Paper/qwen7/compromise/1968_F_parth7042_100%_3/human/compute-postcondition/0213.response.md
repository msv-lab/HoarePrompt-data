Postcondition: `data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and if `x == 0`, then `results` is ['YES']. If `x != 0`, the values of `data`, `index`, `l`, `r`, `x`, and `results` remain as they were before the if-else block executes.
