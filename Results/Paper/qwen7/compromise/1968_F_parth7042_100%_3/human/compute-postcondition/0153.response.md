Output State: **`q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `index` is now `index + 7`, `l` is now `int(data[index - 3])`, `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, and `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the list `v1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)` finds the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the sorted list `v1`. This means `it1` is assigned the position where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted.
- The values of `q`, `index`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged from their previous states.
