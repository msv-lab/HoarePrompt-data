Output State: **The `results` list will contain either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, totaling `q` elements.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` list will contain the outcomes ('YES' or 'NO') for each of the `q` iterations. This list will have exactly `q` elements, with each element representing the result of one iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified within the loop. The `index` variable will be incremented by `2 * q` from its initial value, and the `t` variable will be 0 since the loop has completed all its iterations. The `data` list remains unchanged, and the `results` list will be filled with 'YES' or 'NO' based on the logic inside the loop.
