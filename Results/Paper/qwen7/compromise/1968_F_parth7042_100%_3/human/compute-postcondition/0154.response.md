Output State: **`q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `index` is now `index + 7`, `l` is now `int(data[index - 3])`, `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `it2` which is the index of the element just before `r` in the list `v2`. The value of `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, and `r` is `int(data[index + 1])`. The `bisect_left` function returns the position where `r` would be inserted to keep the list sorted. Subtracting 1 from this position gives `it2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
