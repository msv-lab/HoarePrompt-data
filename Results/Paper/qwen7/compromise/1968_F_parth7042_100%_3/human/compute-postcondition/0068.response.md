Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 5, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is int(data[index + 1]), `x` is pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1], `v1` is not yet defined, `v2` is not yet defined, `it1` is not yet defined, `it2` is not yet defined, `q` is `q - 1`, `results` contains 'YES'**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Since `results` initially contained `'NO'` if the conditions for appending `'YES'` were not met, now it will contain `'YES'` after the append operation. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
