Output State: **`index` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]`.**

The code `n = int(data[index])` takes the value at `data[index]`, which is the third element in the list (since `index` is 2), converts it to an integer, and assigns it to `n`. The value of `index` is updated to 3 because the next index to access would be `index + 1`. The value of `t` and the state of `results` remain unchanged.
