Output State: **`q` is 0, `index` is `index + 6`, and `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` converted to an integer to the variable `n`. The value of `q` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 0. The value of `index` is updated to `index + 6` as per the initial state, but since the exact value of `index` is not specified, it is represented as `index + 6`. The `results` list remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code.
