Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(q)`. The only variables involved here are `q`, which is used as the upper bound for the loop, and the loop variable `_`, which is typically an underscore indicating that the value of the loop variable itself is not used within the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial State Needed for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `q` is greater than 0. If `q` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute at all.

3. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop variable `_` is not used, we only need to ensure that `q` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the information provided about the states after the loop completes all its iterations, these details do not affect the initial state needed for the loop to execute. They describe the state after the loop has completed, not the conditions under which the loop starts executing.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `q`.

**State: **`q` must be greater than 0**
