Output State: The `results` list will contain either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs `q` times, and for each iteration, it appends either 'YES' or 'NO' to the `results` list based on the conditions given, the final `results` list will have exactly `q` elements. Each element in `results` will be either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether the conditions inside the loop were met for that specific iteration.

The `data` list remains unchanged throughout the loop execution. The `index` variable will be `index + (2 * q)`, as the loop increments `index` by 2 in each iteration. The `l` and `r` variables will be set according to the current values of `data` at the positions determined by `index` during each iteration. The `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` variables will be calculated based on the current values of `pf` and `mp` dictionaries for each iteration. The `q` variable will be decremented by 1 after each iteration until it reaches 0.
