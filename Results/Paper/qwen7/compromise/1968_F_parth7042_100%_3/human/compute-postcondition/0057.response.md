Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 3, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the same as before (`mp[pf[r]]`), `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the same as before (`bisect_left(v1, l)`), `it2` is the same as before (`bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`), `q` is `q - 1`, and `v1` is updated to `mp[pf[r]]`**

Explanation: The line `v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]` updates the value of `v2` to be the same as `mp[pf[l - 1]]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
