Output State: **`a[i]` is updated to `int(data[index])`, `index` is now `index_current + 2`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] XOR a[i]`, `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing `i` (where `i` is `i_current + 1`).**

Explanation: The code updates `pf[i]` to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, which means the previous value of `pf[i]` is replaced with the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`. The value of `index` is also increased by 1, making it `index_current + 2`. The value of `a[i]` remains unchanged from its previous state, and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the current value of `i` (which is `i_current + 1`).
