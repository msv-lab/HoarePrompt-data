Output State: **`q` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it2` is the index of the first occurrence of `r` in `v2` using binary search (bisect_left) - 1; `it1` is less than the length of `v1` and `it2` is greater than or equal to 0 and the value at `it1` in `v1` is less than the value at `it2` in `v2`; `results` list now contains 'YES'**.

Explanation: The code appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, all the conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged except for the addition of `'YES'` to the `results` list.
