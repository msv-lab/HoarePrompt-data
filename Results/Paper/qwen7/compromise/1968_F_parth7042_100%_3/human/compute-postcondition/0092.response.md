Output State: **`i` is 2; `index` is increased by 1; `pf[i]` is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`; `mp[pf[i]]` contains `[i]`**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `mp[pf[i]]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `pf[i]` (which is `pf[2]`) is assigned the value of `pf[1] ^ a[2]`. The dictionary `mp` now contains the key `pf[2]` with the value being a list containing the element `[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
