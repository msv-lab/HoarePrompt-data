Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` is ['YES']**.

The code appends the string 'YES' to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially empty, after appending 'YES', `results` now contains one element, which is 'YES'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
