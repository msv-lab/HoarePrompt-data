Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 5, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is int(data[index + 1]), `x` is pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1], `v1` is mp[pf[r]], `v2` is mp[pf[l - 1]], `it1` is not yet defined, `it2` is not yet defined, `q` is `q - 1`, `results` contains 'YES' and we continue to the next iteration.**

Explanation: The code assigns `mp[pf[l - 1]]` to `v2`. Since `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `pf[r]` is `x`, and `pf[l - 1]` is already used to compute `x`, the new value of `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
