Postcondition: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 3, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is now the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is now the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the same as before (`bisect_left(v1, l)`), `it2` is the same as before (`bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`), `results` now contains 'YES', and `q` must be greater than 0.**

This postcondition summarizes that if `x == 0`, then `results` will contain 'YES'. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same regardless of the if condition.
