Output State: **`q` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`**.

This means that `q` remains greater than or equal to 1, `l` and `r` retain their original values from `data[index]` and `data[index + 1]` respectively, `index` is increased by 2, and `x` is calculated as the bitwise XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`.
