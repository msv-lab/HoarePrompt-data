Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`**.

This means that the value of `x` is calculated as the bitwise XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, while the values of `data`, `index`, `l`, and `r` remain as they were before the code was executed.
