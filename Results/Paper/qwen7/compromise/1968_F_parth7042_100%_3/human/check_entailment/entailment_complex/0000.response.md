Reasoning:
1. The program reads input data and processes multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`), the number of queries (`q`), and the array itself.
3. It then processes each query to check if the subarray from index `l` to `r-1` is interesting.
4. To determine if a subarray is interesting, it uses prefix XOR values and a dictionary to store indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
5. The logic to check if a subarray is interesting is correct:
   - If the XOR of the entire subarray (i.e., `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`) is zero, the subarray is interesting.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there exists a valid split point using binary search (`bisect_left`).
6. The program correctly handles all given constraints and examples.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the execution states provided.

Correctness: **True**
