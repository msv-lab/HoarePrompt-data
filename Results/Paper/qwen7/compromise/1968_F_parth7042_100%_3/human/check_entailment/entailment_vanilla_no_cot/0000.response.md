Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Function `func_1` is called but not defined**: The program starts with calling `func_1()`, but this function is not defined before its call. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Input Data**: The program reads the entire input at once and then processes it. However, the way the input is processed is incorrect. Specifically, the indices used to access the data are not correctly updated after processing each test case. This leads to incorrect slicing and processing of the data.

3. **Incorrect Use of `bisect_left`**: The use of `bisect_left` to find the correct positions in the list `mp[pf[r]]` and `mp[pf[l-1]]` is flawed. The logic to check if the subarray is interesting is incorrect because it does not properly handle the conditions required for a subarray to be considered interesting.

4. **Missing Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is supposed to process the input and output the results, but it is not defined in the provided code snippet.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be restructured to correctly handle the input and process each test case independently. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from bisect import bisect_left

def process_test_case(n, q, a):
    pf = [0] * (n + 1)
    mp = defaultdict(list)
    mp[0].append(0)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        a[i] = int(a[i])
        pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
        mp[pf[i]].append(i)
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split())
        x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
        if x == 0:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            v1 = mp[pf[r]]
            v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
            it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2]):
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
    return results

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        a = [0] + list(input().split())
        results = process_test_case(n, q, a)
        print('\n'.join(results))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version ensures that each test case is processed independently and handles the input and output correctly.
