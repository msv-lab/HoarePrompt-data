Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `check` is 2147483647**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `2 ** 31 - 1` to the variable `check`. This expression evaluates to `2147483647`. The initial values of `times` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged values along with the newly assigned value to `check`.
