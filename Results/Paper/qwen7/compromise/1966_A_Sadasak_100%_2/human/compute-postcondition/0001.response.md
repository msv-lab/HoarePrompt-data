Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in arr:`. The objects involved here are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards.
   - `num` is the variable that will take on each value from the list `arr` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`, assigning each element to `num` in turn. The loop will execute as long as there are elements left in the list `arr`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: Since the loop will start with the first element of `arr` and continue until all elements are processed, the only thing we need to ensure is that `arr` is not empty. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute at all.

5. **Formulate the final state**: Given that `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary and does not affect the loop's execution, we only need to ensure that `arr` is not empty.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `arr` must contain at least one element.

**State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards that must contain at least one element, and `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**.
