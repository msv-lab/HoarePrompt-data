### Reasoning

The original assessment is incorrect because the logic in the main part of the program does not correctly minimize the number of cards. Specifically, the logic that checks if `k` exists in the frequency table and prints `k - 1` is flawed. Instead, we need to calculate the minimum number of cards by considering how many full sets of `k` cards we can form and how many cards will remain.

Here is the detailed reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This condition is correct because no exchanges can be made, and the minimum number of cards remains `n`.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The program calls `func_1(nums, k)` to get the frequency table of the card numbers.
   - `func_1` updates the frequency of each card number to ensure no frequency exceeds `k`.

4. **Minimizing Cards:**
   - The original logic incorrectly checks if `k` exists in the frequency table and prints `k - 1`. This is not the correct approach.
   - Instead, we need to calculate the minimum number of cards by determining how many full sets of `k` cards we can form and how many cards will remain.

### Corrected Program

To correctly minimize the number of cards, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of cards that can be removed in full sets of `k`.
2. Subtract the number of full sets from the total number of cards.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        min_cards = n
        for count in freq.values():
            min_cards -= (count // k) * (k - 1)
        print(min_cards)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The `func_1` function calculates the frequency of each card number, ensuring no frequency exceeds `k`.

2. **Minimizing Cards:**
   - For each card type, we calculate how many full sets of `k` cards can be formed (`count // k`).
   - We subtract `(count // k) * (k - 1)` from the total number of cards to account for the cards that can be removed in full sets.

### Final Answer

Based on the corrected logic, the program now correctly minimizes the number of cards. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
