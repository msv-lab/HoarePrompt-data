Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not designed to handle the problem's requirements properly. The function aims to limit the frequency of each number to `k`, but it does not account for the fact that we can only exchange groups of `k` cards with `k-1` cards. This means that if a number appears more than `k` times, we can reduce its count to `k` and then further reduce it to `k-1` if possible.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this issue:

**Test Case:**
```
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```

**Expected Output:** 2

**Actual Output:** 4

**Explanation:**
- The input consists of 5 cards with numbers [4, 1, 1, 4, 4].
- We can choose the three 4s and exchange them for 2 cards (since k=3, we get k-1=2 cards).
- After exchanging, we have [1, 1, 2, 2] (assuming we replace the 4s with 2s).
- Now, we can choose the two 1s and exchange them for 1 card.
- Finally, we have [2, 2, 2], which is 3 cards, but the minimum possible is 2.

The program fails to achieve the minimum number of cards because it does not fully utilize the exchange rule. It simply limits the frequency of each number to `k` and does not consider the possibility of further reducing the count to `k-1`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
