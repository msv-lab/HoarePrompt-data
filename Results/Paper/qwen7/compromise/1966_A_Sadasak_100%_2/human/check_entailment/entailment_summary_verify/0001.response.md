### Reasoning

The original assessment identified several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the analysis step by step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case when `k > n` by printing `n`.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly updates the frequency of each card number to ensure no frequency exceeds `k`.

4. **Checking Frequency Table:**
   - The original program incorrectly checks if `k` exists in the frequency table and prints `k - 1` if it does. This logic is flawed because the goal is to minimize the number of cards, not just check if `k` exists in the frequency table.

### Detailed Analysis of the Corrected Program

The corrected program addresses the issue by:
- Calculating the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further by the given operations.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Corrected Program

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n` because no exchanges can be made.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The program calls `func_1(nums, k)` to get the frequency table of the card numbers.
   - `func_1` updates the frequency of each card number to ensure no frequency exceeds `k`.

4. **Minimizing Cards:**
   - The program iterates over the values in the frequency table.
   - For each count in the frequency table, it calculates how many cards can be reduced by the operation (`count // k * (k - 1)`).
   - It subtracts this value from the total number of cards `n` to get the minimum number of cards left.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the example provided:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `5 3 4 1 1 4 4`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: We can reduce the cards to 2 by exchanging groups of 3 cards.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `1 10 7`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: No operations can be performed, so the answer is 1.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `7 2 4 2 1 100 5 2 3`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: We can reduce the cards to 1 by exchanging groups of 2 cards.

### Conclusion

The corrected program now correctly minimizes the number of cards by ensuring that each card type has at most `k` cards and then calculating the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
