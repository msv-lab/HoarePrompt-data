### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the number of cards (`n`) and the number of cards to exchange (`k`), followed by the list of card numbers (`nums`).

2. **Edge Case Handling**: For the edge case where `k > n`, the program correctly prints `n` because no exchanges can be made.

3. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the frequency of each card number, ensuring that no number appears more than `k` times. This is done using a dictionary `frequency_table`.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - If `k` is present in the values of `frequency_table`, it means that at least one number can be reduced by one through the exchange operation, resulting in `k - 1` cards.
   - Otherwise, the program prints `n`, indicating that no further reductions are possible.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including the edge case (`k > n`), cases where `k` is present in the frequencies, and cases where `k` is not present.
   - The program's output matches the expected results for all given test cases.

Given the above points, the program logic and handling of all test cases are correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
