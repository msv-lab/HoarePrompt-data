Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of special characters required.

2. **Checking Parity of `n`:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd using `if n % 2`.
   - If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must have exactly one neighbor different from itself.

3. **Generating the String:**
   - If `n` is even, the program generates a string `s` consisting of the pattern "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times.
   - This ensures that every character in the generated string will be a special character except for the first and last characters, making sure the total count of special characters is `n`.

4. **String Length Check:**
   - The program then checks if the length of the generated string `s` is less than 200.
   - If the length is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the generated string.
   - If the length exceeds 200, it prints "NO", which is not expected according to the problem statement since we can always generate a valid string of length up to 200 for even `n`.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic for generating the string is flawed because the pattern "AAB" does not ensure that all characters are special. Only the middle characters in the pattern are special, and the first and last characters are not.
- The length check is unnecessary and incorrect because the problem guarantees that a solution exists for even `n` within the constraints.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to generate a string where every character is special. One way to do this is to use a repeating pattern like "AB" which ensures that each character is special.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AB' * (n // 2)
            print('YES')
            print(s)
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the flawed string generation logic and the unnecessary length check. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
