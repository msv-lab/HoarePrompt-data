Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program checks if `n` is odd. If so, it prints 'NO', which is correct because an odd number of special characters cannot be achieved with the given pattern.
3. If `n` is even, the program attempts to construct a string using the pattern 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that every character except the first and last will be special since they have exactly one neighbor different from themselves.
4. The program then checks if the constructed string is less than 200 characters long. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string. If not, it prints 'NO'.
5. The logic for constructing the string and checking its length is correct for even `n`.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
