The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is even and the string 'AAB' repeated `n//2` times is less than 200 characters long, it outputs 'YES' followed by the string. Otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. After processing all test cases, it outputs `t` lines, each containing either 'NO' or 'YES' and possibly a string of 'AAB' repeated `n//2` times if the string length is less than 200.
