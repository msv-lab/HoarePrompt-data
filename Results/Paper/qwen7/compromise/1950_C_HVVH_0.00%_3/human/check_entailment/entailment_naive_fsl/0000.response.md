Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when the hour is 12 in the 24-hour format. According to the problem description, 12 in the 24-hour format should be 12:00 PM, but the program incorrectly sets it to 12:00 AM when `h == 12`. This can be seen in the test case "12:00", which should output "12:00 PM" but instead outputs "12:00 AM".

To fix this, the condition for setting `day` to 'PM' should be changed to:
```python
if h >= 12:
    day = 'PM'
else:
    day = 'AM'
```
This ensures that 12:00 is correctly converted to "12:00 PM".
