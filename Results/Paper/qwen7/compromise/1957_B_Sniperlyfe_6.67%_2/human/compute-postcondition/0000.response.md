Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` containing only zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `nums` with `n` zeros. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the precondition regarding the sum of all `n` remain unchanged.
