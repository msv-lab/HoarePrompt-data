Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, where the logic for constructing the sequence does not maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Bitwise OR Contribution**: The current approach sets each element to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, which is the largest number with a specific number of bits set to 1. However, this does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the final bitwise OR result.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Sum**: After setting each element to the largest possible value, it simply subtracts from `k` and adjusts the last element. This does not ensure that the bitwise OR result has the maximum number of 1s.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to distribute the sum `k` among the elements in such a way that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s. One effective strategy is to use powers of 2 to build up the required sum while ensuring the bitwise OR has many 1s.

Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    power_of_two = 1
    while k > 0:
        if k >= power_of_two:
            nums[0] += power_of_two
            k -= power_of_two
        power_of_two *= 2
    return nums
```

This function works as follows:
- It initializes an array `nums` of length `n` filled with zeros.
- It iterates through powers of 2 starting from 1.
- For each power of 2, if it can be added to the first element without exceeding `k`, it does so and reduces `k` accordingly.
- This ensures that the first element will have the highest possible contribution to the bitwise OR, maximizing the number of 1s.

With this corrected function, the overall program should work as expected to solve the problem correctly.
