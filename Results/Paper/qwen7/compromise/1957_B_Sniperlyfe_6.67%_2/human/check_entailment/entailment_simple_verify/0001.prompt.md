You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `t` test cases, `n` and `k` as specified, `nums` is a list of length `n` where each element is `2^k.bit_length() - 1`. After the loop executes, `k` is reduced by the value of `2^k.bit_length() - 1` for each iteration, but since `nums[i]` is assigned the same value in each iteration, `k` will eventually become less than `2^k.bit_length() - 1`, and the loop will stop when `k` is no longer positive. The final state of `nums` will be a list of `n` elements, each being the maximum possible value for the bit length of `k` before it became too small.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` of length `n`, where each element is `2^k - 1`, except for the last element which is `2^k - 1 + k



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to generate a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The function initializes an array `nums` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then sets each element of `nums` to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. This value is the largest possible integer with the same number of bits as `k` but all set to 1.
   - It subtracts this value from `k` for each iteration.
   - Finally, it adjusts the last element to ensure the sum equals `k`.

3. **Binary Representation and Bitwise OR:**
   - The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements.
   - The approach of setting each element to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` ensures that each element has the maximum possible number of 1s in its binary representation.
   - However, this approach might not always maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the entire sequence because it doesn't consider the bitwise OR across all elements.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `k` is small, setting each element to the maximum possible value might lead to unnecessary large numbers.
   - The adjustment of the last element to ensure the sum is `k` might not always yield the optimal solution for maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 1`, `k = 5`
  - The program outputs `[5]`.
  - The bitwise OR is `5`, which has one 1 in its binary representation.
  - This is correct since `5` is the only number that sums to `5`.

- **Test Case 2:** `n = 2`, `k = 3`
  - The program outputs `[1, 2]`.
  - The bitwise OR is `1 | 2 = 3`, which has two 1s in its binary representation.
  - This is correct since `1` and `2` sum to `3` and provide the maximum number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 2`, `k = 5`
  - The program outputs `[5, 0]`.
  - The bitwise OR is `5 | 0 = 5`, which has three 1s in its binary representation.
  - This is correct since `5` and `0` sum to `5` and provide the maximum number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

- **Test Case 4:** `n = 6`, `k = 51`
  - The program outputs `[3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12]`.
  - The bitwise OR is `3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 47`, which has five 1s in its binary representation.
  - This is incorrect since the sum is `51`, but the bitwise OR is `47`, not `51`.

### Conclusion:

The program does not always maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, the given program is not correct.
