Output State: **`s` is True, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is the last element in `lst[x]` after popping one element, and `lst[x]` is now one element shorter.**

Explanation: The code `y = lst[x].pop()` pops the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to `y`. This means `y` is now the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation, and `lst[x]` is one element shorter after the pop operation. The values of `s` and `x` remain unchanged.
