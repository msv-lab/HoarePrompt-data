Output State: The loop will execute `x-1` times. After all iterations, `x` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, which is `x-1 + 1 = x`. Therefore, `x` can be any integer greater than or equal to 4 (since it must be greater than 3 as per the previous states).

- `y` remains an integer input from the user.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `t` is 1.
- `u` and `v` are integers such that \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\).
- The list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer \(u_1\) such that \(1 \leq u_1 \leq n\).
- `a` and `b` are integers that are inputs to the loop, with `a` being the first integer and `b` being the second integer from each input pair.
- `lst` is a defaultdict where all values are lists. After the loop completes, for every pair `(a, b)` that was input, both `lst[a]` and `lst[b]` will contain each other, meaning `a` and `b` are connected nodes in the graph represented by `lst`.

In summary, after all iterations of the loop, `lst` will represent an undirected graph with `n` nodes, where each edge connects two nodes based on the pairs provided by the user.
