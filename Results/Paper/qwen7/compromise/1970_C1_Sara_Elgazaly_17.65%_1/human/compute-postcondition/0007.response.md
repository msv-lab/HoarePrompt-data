Output State: **`x` must be greater than 2, `y` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\), the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer \(u_1\) such that \(1 \leq u_1 \leq n\), `a` is the first integer input from the user, `b` is the second integer input from the user, and both are integers, and `lst[b]` now includes `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to variables `a` and `b` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
