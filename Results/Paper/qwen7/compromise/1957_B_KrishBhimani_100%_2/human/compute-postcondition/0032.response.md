Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is the maximum number of times `temp * 2 < k` was true before the loop broke, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `temp` will be the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`. The variable `i` will count how many times `temp` was doubled before the condition `temp * 2 >= k` became true, which causes the loop to break. All other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k0`, `arr`, and `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
