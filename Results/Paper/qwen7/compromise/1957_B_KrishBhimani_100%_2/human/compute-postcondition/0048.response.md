Output State: **`i` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is an integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1.**

The code initializes the variable `temp` to 1. This does not affect the values of the other variables, so their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `temp`.
