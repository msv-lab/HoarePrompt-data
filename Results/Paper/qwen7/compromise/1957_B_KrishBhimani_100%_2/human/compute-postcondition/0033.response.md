Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is such that `temp * 2 \>= k`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `temp` will be the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `k`. The variable `i` will be the number of times `temp` was doubled before it became at least `k`. The other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k0`, `arr`, `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
