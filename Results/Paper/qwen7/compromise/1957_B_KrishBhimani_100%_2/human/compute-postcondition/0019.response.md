Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is either 1 or 2, and if `temp * 2 < k`, then `temp` is set to 2 and `i` is set to 1. Otherwise, `temp` remains 1 and `i` remains 0.
