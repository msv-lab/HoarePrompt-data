To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **`i`**: The number of times `temp * 2` was less than `k`.
2. **`temp`**: The largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
3. **`l1`**: A list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
4. **`n`**: The integer obtained from the first element of `l1`.
5. **`k`**: The integer obtained from the second element of `l1`.
6. **`arr`**: An empty list.
7. **`k0`**: Still equal to `k`.
8. **`ans`**: A list containing two elements, which are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)` followed by 0s to make its length equal to `n`.
9. **`temp`**: The largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

From the initial state, we know that `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. This means if `k` is 10, then `temp` would be 8 because 8 is the largest power of 2 less than 10.

Next, we need to determine the value of `i`. Since `i` is the number of times `temp * 2` was less than `k`, we can infer that `i` is the highest power of 2 that can be multiplied by 2 and still be less than `k`. For example, if `k` is 10, then `temp` is 8, and `8 * 2 = 16`, which is not less than 10. So, `i` would be 3 because `8 / 2^3 = 1` and `1 * 2^3 = 8` is less than 10.

Given `i = 3` and `temp = 8` (assuming `k = 10`), we can now determine the elements of `ans`:
- The first element of `ans` is `(1 << i) - 1`, which is `(1 << 3) - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7`.
- The second element of `ans` is `k - sum(ans)`. Since `ans` is `[7]` initially, `sum(ans)` is 7, so the second element is `10 - 7 = 3`.
- To make the length of `ans` equal to `n`, we append 0s. If `n` is 5, then `ans` becomes `[7, 3, 0, 0, 0]`.

Therefore, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

Output: **7 3 0 0 0**
