Output State: **`i` is between 1 and 4 (inclusive), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing two elements which are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`, and `temp` is a power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`; `ans` has been extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))`**

Explanation: The code `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` extends the list `ans` by appending `n - len(ans)` number of zeros. Since `ans` initially contains two elements, its length is 2. Thus, the number of zeros to be appended is `n - 2`. After appending these zeros, the length of `ans` becomes `n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
