Output State: **`i` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is an integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`.**

The code initializes the variable `i` to 0. This does not affect the values of `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, or `k0`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
