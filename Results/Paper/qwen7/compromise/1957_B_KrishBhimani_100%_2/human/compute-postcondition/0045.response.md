Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is an integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The line `k0 = k` simply assigns the value of `k` to `k0`. No other changes are made to the variables or the lists. Therefore, the values of `l1`, `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged, and `k0` is now just another name for `k`.
