Postcondition: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`. If `n` equals 1, the function does not change `l1`, `n`, and `k`. Otherwise, `i` is the number of times `temp * 2` was less than `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is still equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, which are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)` followed by 0s to make its length equal to `n`.**
