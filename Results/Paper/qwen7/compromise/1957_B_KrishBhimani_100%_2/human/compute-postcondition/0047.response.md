Output State: **`i` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is an integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `ans = []` initializes an empty list named `ans`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `k0` remain unchanged.
