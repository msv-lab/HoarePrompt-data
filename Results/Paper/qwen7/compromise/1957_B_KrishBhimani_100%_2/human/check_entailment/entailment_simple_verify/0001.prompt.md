You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

        if n == 1:
            print(k)

            arr = []

            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two positive integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

    #State: Output State: The loop will have executed all iterations based on the input provided. For each test case, the variable `ans` will contain a list of integers where the first element is \((1 << i) - 1\), the second element is \(k - (1 << i) - 1\), and the rest of the elements are 0s to make the total length of the list equal to `n`. Here, `i` is determined as the number of times `temp * 2` is less than `k` before it is no longer true, with `temp` being the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. If `n` is 1, `ans` will simply be `[k]`.
    #
    #The state of other variables such as `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, and `temp` will be as described for the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `l1` will be the list of strings obtained from the last input, `n` and `k` will be the integers obtained from the last input, `k0` will be equal to `k`, `arr` will be an empty list, and `temp` will be the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` if `n` is not 1. If `n` is 1, these variables will retain their values from the last input without further changes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Single Element Case:**
   - If `n == 1`, the program simply prints `k`. This is correct because the sum must be `k` and there's only one element, so it should be `k`.

3. **Multiple Elements Case:**
   - If `n > 1`, the program attempts to construct an array `ans` that satisfies both conditions.
   - It initializes `temp` to 1 and iterates to find the highest power of 2 less than `k`.
   - It appends `(1 << i) - 1` to `ans` (which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit used).
   - It then appends `k - sum(ans)` to `ans` to ensure the total sum is `k`.
   - Finally, it pads the array with zeros to make its length `n`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program processes all test cases in a loop but does not reset variables between test cases. This could lead to incorrect results if the same variable is reused across different test cases.

2. **Constructing the Array:**
   - The logic to construct the array `ans` is flawed. Specifically:
     - Appending `(1 << i) - 1` to `ans` will create a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit used. However, this might not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the entire array.
     - Appending `k - sum(ans)` might not always result in a valid solution. For example, if `k - sum(ans)` is negative, it won't work.
     - Padding with zeros does not necessarily help in maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

3. **Bitwise OR Maximization:**
   - The program does not explicitly maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the array. Instead, it constructs the array in a way that may not achieve the maximum possible number of 1s.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the array and does not handle multiple test cases properly.

### Correctness: **False**
