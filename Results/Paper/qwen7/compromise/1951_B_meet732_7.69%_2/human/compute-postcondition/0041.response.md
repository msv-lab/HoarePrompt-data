Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of n cows, and an integer `k` such that 1 <= k <= n. Based on certain conditions involving the list `a` and the integer `k`, the function returns one of the following values: n - 1, 13, a value that is 1 less than the first element of list `ind` (which is greater than 14), the maximum value between k minus the first index in list `ind` or the first index in list `ind` minus 1 (given that k is 14 and `ind[0]` is less than or equal to 14), the minimum value between the second element of list `ind` minus 1 and 13, the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`, or the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]` (given that `ind[0]` is not 0, `k` is 14, and `ind` contains at least two elements).**
