Output State: **`ind` is an empty list, `a` is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of n cows, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `x` is the k-th element of list `a`, `c` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `c` to 0. The values of the other variables (`ind`, `a`, `k`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
