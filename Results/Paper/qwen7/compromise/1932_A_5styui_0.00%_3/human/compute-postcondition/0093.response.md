Output State: **`b` is a non-empty string, `s` is 0, `i` is `i_final + len(b)`, `d` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, and `j` is `len(b)`**.

Explanation: The line `s = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `s`. All other variables (`b`, `i`, `d`, `a`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
