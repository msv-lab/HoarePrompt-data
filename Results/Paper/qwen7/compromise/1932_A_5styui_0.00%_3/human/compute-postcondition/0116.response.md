Postcondition: `b` is a list of characters, and `s` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `j` is '@'. If the element at index `j` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the list `b` is empty or the element at index `j + 1` is '*', we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
