Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `b` is a list of characters.
- The postcondition specifies what happens based on the elements at index `j`:
  - If `b[j]` is `@`, then `s` is incremented by 1.
  - If `b[j]` is `*`, we break out of the loop.
  - If `b` is empty or `b[j]` is neither `@` nor `*`, we ensure that `b[:j+1]` is False.
  - If `b[j + 1]` is a `*`, we also break out of the loop.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(len(b)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = len(b) - 1`.
2. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `j`.

### Adjusting the State
- **Initial Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume the following:
  - `b` is a list of characters (e.g., `['a', 'b', '@', 'c', '*']`).
  - `j` is the index of the current element being processed (e.g., `j = 2`).

### Processing the Current Element
- **Current Element**: `b[j]` is `@`.
- **Postcondition**: Since `b[j]` is `@`, `s` is incremented by 1.
- **Next Index**: After processing `b[2]`, the next index to process is `j + 1 = 3`.

### New State
- **List `b`**: Unchanged from the previous iteration.
- **Index `j`**: Incremented by 1, so `j = 3`.
- **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, `b` should not be empty and `b[3]` should not be `*`.

### Final State
Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`b` is a list of characters, `j` is 3, and `b[3]` is not `*`**.

If `b[3]` were `*`, the loop would break, and we would need to handle that case separately. However, since we are focusing on the state before the potential break, we assume it is not `*`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`b` is a list of characters, `j` is 3**.
