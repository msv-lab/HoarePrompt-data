Postcondition: `b` is a non-empty string, the character at index `j` is not '*', and the character at index `j` is not '@'. If the character at index `j + 1` is '*', the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `j + 1` is not '*', the function continues without any changes to the string `b`.
