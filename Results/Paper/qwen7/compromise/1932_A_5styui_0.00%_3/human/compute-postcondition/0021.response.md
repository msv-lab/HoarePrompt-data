Postcondition: `b` is a non-empty string, and if the character at index `j` of `b` is '@', the integer `s` is incremented by 1. If the character at index `j` is neither '*' nor '@', and the character at index `j + 1` is '*', the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs to `s`.
