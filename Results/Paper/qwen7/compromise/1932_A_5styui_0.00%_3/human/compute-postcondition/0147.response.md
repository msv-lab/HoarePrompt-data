Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through standard input. It reads an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of length n consisting of '.', '@', and '*', where '.' represents an empty cell, '@' represents a cell with a coin, and '*' represents a cell with thorns. The function then returns a series of outputs, one for each test case, indicating the result based on the given conditions.**
