Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement.
2. The logic in the program only checks for a specific condition (`q == i + 1`) which is not sufficient to solve the problem.
3. The program assumes that if no pair of friends `(i, p[i])` satisfy `q == i + 1`, then the answer must be 3. However, this is not always true. The correct approach should involve finding cycles in the friendship graph and determining the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
4. The program does not account for scenarios where multiple cycles exist, and it does not correctly identify and handle these cases.

Given the above points, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
