Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Logic Error**: The program attempts to find a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., `l[i]` and `l[l[i]-1]` are indices that point back to each other). If such a pair exists, it prints `2`, otherwise, it prints `3`. However, this logic is flawed because it only checks for one specific pair and does not account for the possibility that multiple pairs might exist, which could potentially reduce the number of invitations needed.

2. **Handling Multiple Pairs**: The program should check for all possible pairs and ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. If there are multiple pairs where both friends in the pair receive invitations, it might be possible to invite fewer than 3 people.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program fails to handle cases where no single pair exists but inviting a few strategically chosen friends can still satisfy the condition of having at least 2 friends at the party.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
- Identify all cycles in the friendship graph.
- Ensure that at least 2 friends from any cycle are invited.
- If there are multiple cycles, invite the minimum number of friends required to satisfy the condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Track visited nodes to avoid revisiting
        visited = [False] * n
        min_invitations = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n):
            if not visited[i]:
                cycle_size = 0
                current = i
                while not visited[current]:
                    visited[current] = True
                    current = l[current - 1] - 1
                    cycle_size += 1
                
                # At least 2 friends from this cycle must be invited
                min_invitations = min(min_invitations, cycle_size // 2 + (1 if cycle_size % 2 != 0 else 0))
        
        # Ensure at least 2 friends come to the party
        min_invitations = max(min_invitations, 2)
        print(min_invitations)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that it finds the minimum number of invitations required to have at least 2 friends at the party by considering all cycles in the friendship graph.
