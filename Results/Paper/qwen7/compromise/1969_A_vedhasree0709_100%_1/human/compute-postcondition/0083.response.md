Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while i <= n - 1:`. The variables involved in this condition are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `p` is `l[n-1]`
   - `q` is `l[l[n-1] - 1]`
   - `j` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `l` is updated to a list of integers obtained from user input

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute the first time**:
   - The loop will execute the first time if `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`.
   - Currently, `i` is 0, so the condition `0 <= n - 1` must hold true.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is already 0, the only variable that needs adjustment is `n`. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 (since `0 <= n - 1` implies `n >= 1`).

5. **Final state before the loop**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `p` is `l[n-1]`
   - `q` is `l[l[n-1] - 1]`
   - `j` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `l` is updated to a list of integers obtained from user input

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is 0, `p` is `l[n-1]`, `q` is `l[l[n-1] - 1]`, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `l` is updated to a list of integers obtained from user input**
