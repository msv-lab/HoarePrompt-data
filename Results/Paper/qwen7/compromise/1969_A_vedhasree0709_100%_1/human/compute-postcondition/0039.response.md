Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[n-2]`, `q` is `l[l[n-2] - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`i`, `l`, `j`, `p`, `q`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The new value of `n` is the integer input provided by the user.
