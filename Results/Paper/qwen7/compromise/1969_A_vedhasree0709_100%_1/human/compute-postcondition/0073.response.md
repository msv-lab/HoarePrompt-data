Output State: `i` is `n`, `p` is `l[n-1]`, `q` is `l[l[n-1] - 1]`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will increment until it reaches `n`, since the loop condition is `i <= n - 1`. Therefore, `i` will be equal to `n` after the last iteration. At this point, `p` will be assigned the value of `l[n-1]` (since `p = l[i]` in the loop body), and `q` will be assigned the value of `l[p - 1]` (which is `l[l[n-1] - 1]`). The variable `j` is set to 1 when the condition `q == i + 1` is met inside the loop, but since we do not know the exact value of `l` or the specific conditions under which `j` is set, we can only conclude that `j` remains 1 if the condition was met within the first 3 iterations and does not change afterward. However, based on the given information, the focus is on the final values of `i`, `p`, and `q`.
