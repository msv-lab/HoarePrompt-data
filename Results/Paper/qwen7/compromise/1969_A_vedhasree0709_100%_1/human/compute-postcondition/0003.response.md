Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code initializes the variable `i` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n` or `l`. Therefore, `n` remains an input integer, and `l` remains a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
