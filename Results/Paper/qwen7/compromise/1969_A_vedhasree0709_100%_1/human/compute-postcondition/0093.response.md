Output State: **`i` is 1, `p` is `l[0]`, `q` is `l[l[0] - 1]`, `j` is either 0 or 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 0, so after executing this line, `i` becomes 1. The values of `p`, `q`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
