Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(int(input())):` statement. This means the loop will run based on the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `p` is `l[n-1]`.
   - `q` is `l[p - 1]`.
   - Since the condition `(j == 0)` is true, `j` remains 1 after the if statement executes.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will execute again if the input integer (which determines the number of iterations) is greater than 0.
   - Since `i` is `n`, and `n` is the input integer, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `n` will be decremented by 1 because the loop will run for `int(input()) - 1` times in the next iteration.

4. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be `n + 1` (since it starts as `n` and will be incremented).
   - `n` will be `n - 1` (since the loop will run for `int(input()) - 1` times).
   - `l` remains unchanged.
   - `j` remains 1.
   - `p` will be `l[(n-1) - 1] = l[n-2]`.
   - `q` will be `l[p - 1] = l[l[n-2] - 1]`.

Given these adjustments, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is `n - 1`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[n-2]`, `q` is `l[l[n-2] - 1]`**.
