Output State: **`i` is 2, `p` is `l[2]`, `q` is `l[1]`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**

Explanation: The code `q = l[p - 1]` updates the value of `q` to be the element at index `p - 1` in the list `l`. Given that `p` is initially `l[2]`, the new value of `q` becomes `l[2 - 1]` which is `l[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
