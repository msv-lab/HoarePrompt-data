Output State: **`i` is 1, `p` is `l[1]`, `q` is 2**

Explanation: The code `p = l[i]` assigns the value at index `i` of list `l` to variable `p`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `p` is updated to `l[1]`. The values of `q` and the condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 remain unchanged.
