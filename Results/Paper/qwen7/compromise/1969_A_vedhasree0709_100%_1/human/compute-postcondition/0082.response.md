Output State: **`i` is 0, `p` is `l[n-1]`, `q` is `l[l[n-1] - 1]`, `j` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `l` is updated to a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The line `j = 0` sets the variable `j` to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of `i`, `p`, `q`, `n`, or the list `l`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
