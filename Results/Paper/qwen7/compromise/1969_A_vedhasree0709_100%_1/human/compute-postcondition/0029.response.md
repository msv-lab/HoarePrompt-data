Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[2]`, `q` is `l[0]`, `q` is equal to `l[p - 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since there is no explicit loop or conditional block shown in the given code, the only effect is that the program would exit the current loop or conditional context. All the other variables retain their previous values as per the initial state.
