Output State: **`i` is 1, `p` is `l[1]`, `q` is `l[l[0] - 1]`, `j` is 1, and `q` is updated to `l[p - 1]`**.

Explanation: The variable `j` is assigned the value `1`. The other variables (`i`, `p`, `q`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `q` is updated to `l[p - 1]`, which was already part of the initial state.
