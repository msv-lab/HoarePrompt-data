Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object involved here is the result of `int(input())`, which we'll call `num_tests`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `num_tests` is a positive integer. Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This means `t` can be any value within this range.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will run based on the input from `int(input())`, the state before the loop should reflect that `num_tests` (the result of `int(input())`) must be a positive integer. Given the constraints on `t`, `num_tests` can be any integer from 1 to 5000.

4. **Final state adjustment**: The state before the loop should include the fact that `num_tests` is a positive integer, and since `t` was given as a possible value for `num_tests`, we can use `t` to represent this condition.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `num_tests` (which is the result of `int(input())`) must be a positive integer, and since `t` is a valid value for `num_tests`, we can use `t` to represent this condition.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, num_tests must be a positive integer**
