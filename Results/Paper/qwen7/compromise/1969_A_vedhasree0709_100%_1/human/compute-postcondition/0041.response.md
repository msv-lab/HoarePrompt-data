Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[n-2]`, `q` is `l[l[n-2] - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code sets `i` to 0, which changes its value from `n + 1` to 0. All other variables (`n`, `l`, `j`, `p`, `q`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
