Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `r` is a lambda function that maps integers from input split by spaces, `t` is the first integer from the input split by spaces.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    r()
    a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
    b = [0, 0]
    for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
        v = y - x
        b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
    print(b, 'B')
    u, = r()
    while u:
        u -= 1
        c, d = r()
        if c < d:
            print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
        else:
            print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `b` is a list with three elements where the first element is `0 + v_3`, the second element is `v_3 + v_3`, and the third element is `v_3 + v_3`, `x` is `w_3`, `y` is `x`, `z` is `y`, `v` is `v_3`, `u` is `0`, `c` and `d` are the return values from function `r()`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `u` will be decremented until it reaches `0`. This means the loop will run `u` times, which is initially some positive integer value. After each iteration, `c` and `d` are assigned new values from the function `r()`. However, since the problem does not specify the exact behavior of `r()`, we can only say that `c` and `d` will hold the most recent values returned by `r()` after the loop completes. The values of `b`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `v`, and `u` will be as described, with `u` being `0` and `c` and `d` holding the latest values from `r()`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: `u` is a falsy value, `a` is a list with at least 5 elements, `c` and `d` are the return values from function `r()`, `b` is a list where the last two elements are the result of cumulative additions and comparisons as described.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `u` will eventually become a falsy value (such as 0), indicating that the loop condition `u` is no longer true. The lists `a`, `c`, `d`, and `b` will retain their initial conditions except for the last two elements of `b`, which will be updated based on the cumulative additions and comparisons performed within the loop. The function `r()` returns new values for `c` and `d` each time the loop runs, but these values do not affect the final state of `u`, `a`, or `b` except for the last two elements of `b`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The loop has completed all its iterations, and the variable `u` is now a falsy value (0). The variables `c` and `d` hold the most recent values returned by the function `r()` after the loop has finished executing. The list `b` remains unchanged from its final state after the last iteration of the loop.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
