Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `b` is a list with three elements:
     - First element: `0 + v_3` which simplifies to `v_3`
     - Second element: `v_3 + v_3` which simplifies to `2 * v_3`
     - Third element: `v_3 + v_3` which simplifies to `2 * v_3`
   - `x` is `w_3`
   - `y` is `x`, so `y` is also `w_3`
   - `z` is `y`, so `z` is also `w_3`
   - `v` is `v_3`
   - `u` is `u - 1`
   - `c` and `d` are the return values from function `r()`. The current value of `c` is less than the current value of `d`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
   ```

3. **Evaluating the Print Statement:**
   - The expression inside the print statement is `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]`.
   - Since `b` is a list with three elements: `[v_3, 2 * v_3, 2 * v_3]`, we need to evaluate the indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2`:
     - If `d` is 2 (the maximum possible value since `c < d` and both are integers), then `(d - 1) * 2 = (2 - 1) * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2`.
     - If `c` is 1 (the minimum possible value since `c < d`), then `(c - 1) * 2 = (1 - 1) * 2 = 0 * 2 = 0`.
   - Therefore, `b[(d - 1) * 2]` is `b[2]` which is `2 * v_3`.
   - And `b[(c - 1) * 2]` is `b[0]` which is `v_3`.
   - So, the expression becomes `2 * v_3 - v_3 = v_3`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output `v_3`.

Output: **v_3**
