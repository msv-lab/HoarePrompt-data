The function processes a list of integers `a` and handles multiple queries. For each query, it calculates and prints the difference between specific elements in the list `a`. Initially, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the list `a`, performs some calculations, and handles the queries. Finally, it outputs the differences for each query based on the calculated values stored in the list `b`.
