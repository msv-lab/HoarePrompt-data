Output State: `cnt` is the total number of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the total number of iterations performed (which is the length of the strings `s` and `t`), `s1` is the count of '1's in string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in string `t`.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cnt` will hold the total count of differing characters between strings `s` and `t`. The variable `i` will be set to the index of the last character checked, which is `n - 1` (where `n` is the length of the strings). The variable `n` will be equal to the length of the strings since it is reduced by one with each iteration until it reaches zero. The counts of '1's in strings `s` and `t` (`s1` and `t1`) remain unchanged from their values after the last iteration of the loop.
