Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cnt` is 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `t`, otherwise `cnt` is 0.
   - `t1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`.
   - `t` is an input integer.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is the string input by the user.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop is `for i in range(n)`, the loop will increment `i` by 1 at each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `n` is greater than 0, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged since it is an input integer and does not change within the loop.

5. **Final State**:
   - `cnt` remains unchanged unless the characters at index `i` in `s` and `t` are different, but since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, `cnt` stays as it was.
   - `t1` remains unchanged.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is now `1`.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cnt` is 1 if the character at index 1 in `s` is not equal to the character at index 1 in `t`, otherwise `cnt` is 0; `t1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`; `t` is an input integer; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 0**.
