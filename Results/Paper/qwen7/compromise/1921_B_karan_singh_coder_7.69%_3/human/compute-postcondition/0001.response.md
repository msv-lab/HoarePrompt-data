Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The precondition that `t` must be a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) remains unchanged, but now `n` has been assigned the value of the input provided by the user.
