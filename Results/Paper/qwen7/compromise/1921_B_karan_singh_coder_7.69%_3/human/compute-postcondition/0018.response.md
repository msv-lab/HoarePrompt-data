Output State: **`cnt` will be the total count of positions where the characters in string `s` do not match the corresponding characters in string `t`; `t1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`; `t` is an input integer; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `i` is `n-1`; `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`; `n` must be greater than 0; `s1` is not equal to `t1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1` and assigns it to the variable `d`. The values of `cnt`, `t1`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `i`, `s1`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
