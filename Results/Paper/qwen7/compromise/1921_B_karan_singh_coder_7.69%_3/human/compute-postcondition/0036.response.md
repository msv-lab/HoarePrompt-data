Postcondition: **`cnt` will be the total number of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` do not match, `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes, `n` will be reduced to the number of iterations performed (which is `i+1`), and `s` and `t` will remain unchanged from their values after the last iteration of the loop. The condition `s1 == t1` is true.**
