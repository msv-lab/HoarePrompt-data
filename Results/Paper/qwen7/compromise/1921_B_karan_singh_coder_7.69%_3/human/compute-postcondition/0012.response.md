Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged.**

This means that the value of `cnt` is updated based on whether the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are different. If they are different, `cnt` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `cnt` stays the same.
