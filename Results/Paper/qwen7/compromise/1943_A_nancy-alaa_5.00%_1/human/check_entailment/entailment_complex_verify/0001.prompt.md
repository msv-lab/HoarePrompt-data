You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        first = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to iterate for all test cases provided by the input. After all iterations, the value of `i` will be the smallest index that either does not exist in the array `arr` or exists but has a count of 1 in the counter `mpp`, and `first` will remain `True`. The variable `mpp` will be a Counter object containing the counts of each element in `arr` for the last test case processed. If such an `i` is found during any iteration, it will be printed and the loop will terminate early. If no such `i` is found, the loop will process all test cases, and the final value of `i` will be the length of the last `arr` list, assuming no earlier condition was met to break the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after processing all test cases, `i` will be the smallest missing index or the first index with a single occurrence (if `first` becomes `True`), or the size of the last input list if no such index is found. The `mpp` will reflect the counts of elements in the last input list, and `first` will indicate if a unique element was found previously.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers. For each test case, it determines and prints the smallest index \( i \) that either does not exist in the list or exists but appears exactly once. If no such index is found, it prints the length of the list. The function uses a counter to keep track of the occurrences of each element in the list and iterates through the list to find the required index. The final output depends on the conditions met during the iteration.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Counting Elements:**
   - It uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count occurrences of each element in the array.

3. **Game Logic Implementation:**
   - The program iterates through the numbers from `0` to `n-1`.
   - If a number `i` is not present in the array (i.e., `i` is not a key in the counter), it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If a number `i` appears exactly once and it is the second occurrence of such a number (indicated by the `first` flag), it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If a number `i` appears exactly once and it is the first occurrence of such a number, it sets the `first` flag to `True`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Game Representation:**
   - The program does not simulate the actual game where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements.
   - It simply checks for the presence of numbers in the array and prints the first missing number it finds, which does not reflect the optimal strategy for both players.

2. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented:**
   - The program does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob will play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX, respectively.
   - The logic does not consider the sequence of moves and the impact on the MEX value after each move.

3. **Output Mismatch:**
   - The output for the given examples does not match the expected results. For instance, for the input `[0, 0, 1, 1]`, the expected output is `2`, but the program might output something different.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the game logic and does not account for the optimal strategies of both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
