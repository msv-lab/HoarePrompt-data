Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `first` is true, and either `i` is not in the keys of `mpp` or `mpp[i]` equals 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `first`, or `mpp`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently in. All other conditions and values remain the same as the initial state.
