Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. Since the initial conditions are that `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, and if `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement (or if `i` is in `mpp.keys()`, the conditions remain unchanged), the `break` statement does not change these conditions. It only indicates that we are breaking out of the current loop or if statement.
