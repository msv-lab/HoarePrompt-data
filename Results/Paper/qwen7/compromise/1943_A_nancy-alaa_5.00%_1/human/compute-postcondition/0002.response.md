Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string, and then maps them to integers, storing the result in the list `arr`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
