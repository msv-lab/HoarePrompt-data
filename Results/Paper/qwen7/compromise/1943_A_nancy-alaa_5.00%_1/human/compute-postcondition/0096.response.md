Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially 3.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 3.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is given to be greater than 3, it will always be greater than 0, ensuring the loop can execute.

4. **Adjust the states of the variables**:
   - `i` should be set to 0 because the loop starts with `i` as the starting index of the range function, which is 0.
   - `n` should remain as it is since it is already given to be greater than 3 and thus greater than 0.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `first`, `arr`, and `mpp` are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 3**
