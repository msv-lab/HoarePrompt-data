Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `first` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `first` is explicitly set to `True`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the condition related to `first` and `mpp[1]` does not affect the current state since `first` is now `True`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `first` and retains the original values of `i` and `n`.
