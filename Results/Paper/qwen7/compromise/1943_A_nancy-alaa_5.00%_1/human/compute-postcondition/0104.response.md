Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `n` is greater than 3 but its exact value is not specified.
- `first` is explicitly stated to be `True`.
- `mpp[i]` is explicitly stated to be 1, and since `i` is 0, `mpp[0]` is 1.

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`.

Output: **0**
