Output State: **`first` is True, `i` is 3 and `n` must be at least 1. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()` or `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1 and `first` is false, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `first` is explicitly set to `True`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions, and the postcondition related to `i`, `n`, `mpp`, and `first` remains valid.
