Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd but can still form another rectangle. For example, a \(3 \times 5\) rectangle can be cut into two \(3 \times 2.5\) rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a \(6 \times 2.5\) rectangle. However, the program incorrectly outputs "No" in such cases because it only checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. 

To fix this, the program needs to check if the sum of \(a\) and \(b\) is even, which would allow the formation of another rectangle. Hereâ€™s an improved version:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This version correctly handles all cases, including those where both dimensions are odd but their sum is even, allowing the formation of another rectangle.
