Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Checking for Even Dimensions:**
   - The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
     - If `a` is even, it splits `a` into two equal halves (`a1` and `a2`), both being `a // 2`.
     - If `b` is even, it splits `b` into two equal halves (`b1` and `b2`), both being `b // 2`.

3. **Forming New Rectangles:**
   - After splitting, the program checks if the resulting smaller rectangles can form a new rectangle that is different from the original.
     - If `a1` (or `b1`) is not equal to `b` (or `a`), it prints "Yes" indicating that a new rectangle can be formed.
     - If `a1` (or `b1`) is equal to `b` (or `a`), it prints "No" indicating that no new rectangle can be formed.

4. **Handling Odd Dimensions:**
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program directly prints "No" since no even split can produce a different rectangle.

### Correctness Check:

- **Even Dimensions:**
  - If `a` or `b` is even, the program correctly identifies that a new rectangle can be formed by splitting the larger dimension into two equal parts.
  - It then checks if the resulting smaller rectangle can form a new shape that is different from the original. This check is correct.

- **Odd Dimensions:**
  - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program correctly identifies that no new rectangle can be formed since splitting an odd dimension results in two odd dimensions, which cannot form a different rectangle.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases like `1x1` and `2x1` correctly by printing "No" in these scenarios.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given dimensions. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
