Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.
3. The logic checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If so, it proceeds to check if the resulting smaller rectangles can form a different rectangle.
4. Specifically, if `a` is even, it divides `a` by 2 and checks if the resulting halves (`a1` and `a2`) do not equal `b`. Similarly, if `b` is even, it divides `b` by 2 and checks if the resulting halves (`b1` and `b2`) do not equal `a`.
5. If these conditions are met, it prints 'Yes', indicating that a different rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
6. The program handles all given test cases as per the problem statement and the provided examples.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the correct logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
