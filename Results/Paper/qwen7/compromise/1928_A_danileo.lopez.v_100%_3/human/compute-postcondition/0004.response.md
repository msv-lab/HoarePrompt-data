Output State: The output state depends on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. For each input pair (a, b), if either a or b is even, and the conditions specified in the if statements are met, "Yes" will be printed; otherwise, "No" will be printed for that iteration. The final output state is a series of "Yes" or "No" based on the given inputs.
