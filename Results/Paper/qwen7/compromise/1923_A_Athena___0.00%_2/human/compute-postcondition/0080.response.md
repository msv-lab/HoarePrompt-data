Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element removed.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element (index 0) from the list `a`. Since `a[0]` was initially 0, after executing the code, the first element of the list `a` is no longer present, making it a non-empty list with the first element removed.
