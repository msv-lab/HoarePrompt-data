Output State: `a` is an empty list or a list where the first element is not zero.

Explanation: The loop continues to remove elements from the front of the list `a` as long as the first element is zero. After executing the loop three times, we know that the first element of the list is no longer zero. Therefore, if there are any remaining elements in the list, they are all non-zero. If the list becomes empty, it remains empty. Thus, the final state of `a` is either an empty list or a list with the first element not being zero.
