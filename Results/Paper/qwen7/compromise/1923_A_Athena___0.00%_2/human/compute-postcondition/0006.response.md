Output State: **`a` is not empty and the first element of `a` is now the second element of the original `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the initial state required that `a[0]` must be 0, after popping the first element, `a[0]` will now be the second element of the original list `a`. The condition that `a` must not be empty is still valid, as long as there was at least one element in the list before popping.
