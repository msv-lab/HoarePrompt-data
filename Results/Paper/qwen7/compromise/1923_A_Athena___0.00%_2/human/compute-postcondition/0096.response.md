Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is used as an index to iterate over the list `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`. Therefore, the loop will continue until `i` reaches the length of `a`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `a`**:
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - The first element of `a` is set to the second element of the original list.
   - The length of `a` is less than or equal to the length of the original list minus 7.
   - The last element of `a` is 0.

4. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute**:
   - Since the loop will run based on the length of `a`, the initial length of `a` must be such that the loop can execute at least once.
   - The loop will continue until the last element of `a` becomes non-zero (or the list is exhausted).

Given these points, we need to ensure that the initial length of `a` is at least 1 (since `a` is non-empty) and that the last element is 0, so the loop can start executing.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with its first element set to the second element of the original list, the length of `a` is at least 1 and less than or equal to the length of the original list minus 7, and the last element of `a` is 0**.
