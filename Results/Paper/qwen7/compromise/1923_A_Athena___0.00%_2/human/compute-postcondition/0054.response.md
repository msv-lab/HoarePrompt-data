Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `a and a[-1] == 0`.
   - `a` is a list.
   - The loop continues as long as `a` is not empty (`a`) and the last element of `a` is zero (`a[-1] == 0`).

2. **Current State**: 
   - `a` is a list without its last element.
   - The last element of `a` (which was removed) is zero.

3. **Determine What Needs to Change**:
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must not be empty (`a`), and the last element of `a` must be zero (`a[-1] == 0`).
   - Since `a` is currently a list without its last element, it means `a` is not empty.
   - Therefore, the only thing that needs to change is ensuring that the last element of `a` remains zero.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - The last element of `a` must remain zero for the loop to continue.

Given this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted such that the last element of `a` is still zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a list without its last element, and the last element of `a` is zero**
