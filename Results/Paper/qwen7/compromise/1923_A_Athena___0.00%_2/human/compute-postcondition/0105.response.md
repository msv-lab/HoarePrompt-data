Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list of integers with its first element set to the second element of the original list, the length of `a` is at least 1 and less than or equal to the length of the original list minus 7, the last element of `a` is 0, `res` is incremented by 1 if `a[0]` was 0 in the previous iteration, and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is 0, `res` is incremented by 1.
