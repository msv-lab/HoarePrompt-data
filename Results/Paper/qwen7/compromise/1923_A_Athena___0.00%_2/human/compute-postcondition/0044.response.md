The loop condition is `a and a[0] == 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, both parts of this condition must be true:

1. `a` should not be empty.
2. The first element of `a` (`a[0]`) should be 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `a[0]` is the first element of the original list excluding the first element. This means that `a[0]` was 0 in the previous iteration, and since the loop continued, `a` was not empty.

To ensure the loop executes again, `a` must still be non-empty, and `a[0]` must still be 0. Therefore, we need to adjust these two states.

State: **`a` is a non-empty list and `a[0]` is 0**
