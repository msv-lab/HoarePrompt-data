Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with its first element set to the second element of the original list, the length of `a` is less than or equal to the length of the original list minus 6, and the last element of `a` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Initially, the last element of `a` is 0. After popping the last element, the length of `a` decreases by 1, making it less than or equal to the original length minus 6 (since the first element was already set to the second element, reducing the effective length by 1). The first element remains unchanged, and the last element is no longer present in the list.
