Output State: **`a` is not empty and `a[-1]` is not 0**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that `a[-1]` was 0 in the initial state, after executing the code, `a[-1]` will no longer be 0. However, `a` remains non-empty since only one element is removed.
