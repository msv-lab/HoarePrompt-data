Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `a and a[-1] == 0`.
   - `a and a[-1] == 0` means that the list `a` is not empty (`a` is truthy) and the last element of `a` is zero.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `a` is not an empty list.
   - The last element of `a` is not zero.

3. **Determine What Needs to Change**:
   - For the loop to execute again, the last element of `a` must be zero.
   - Since `a` is not empty, it remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - We need to change the last element of `a` to zero to satisfy the loop condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the last element of `a`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is not an empty list and the last element of `a` is zero**
