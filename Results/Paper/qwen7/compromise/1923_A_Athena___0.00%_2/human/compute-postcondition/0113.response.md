Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and a list of n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) where each integer is either 0 or 1, with at least one integer being 1. For each test case, it removes leading and trailing zeros from the list, counts the remaining zeros, and prints both the modified list and the zero count. The function ultimately outputs these results for each test case.**
