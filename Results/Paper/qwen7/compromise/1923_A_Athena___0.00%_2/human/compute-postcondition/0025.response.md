Output State: **`res` is 1, `i` is 0, and `a[i]` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which is not relevant since only the increment is mentioned). The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0, and the value of `a[i]` (which was 0) is still 0.
