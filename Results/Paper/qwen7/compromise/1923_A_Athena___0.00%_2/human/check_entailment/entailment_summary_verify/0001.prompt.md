You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and a list of n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) where each integer is either 0 or 1, with at least one integer being 1. For each test case, it removes leading and trailing zeros from the list, counts the remaining zeros, and prints both the modified list and the zero count. The function ultimately outputs these results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of cells `a` which indicates whether a cell contains a chip (`1`) or is free (`0`).

2. **Removing Leading and Trailing Free Cells:**
   - The program removes leading free cells (cells with value `0` at the start of the list).
   - It also removes trailing free cells (cells with value `0` at the end of the list).

3. **Counting Operations:**
   - The program counts the number of free cells (`0`s) remaining in the list after removing the leading and trailing free cells.
   - This count is printed as the result, which should represent the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Operations:**
   - The program simply counts the number of free cells (`0`s) in the modified list `a`. However, this does not correctly reflect the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.
   - The correct approach would be to count how many chips need to be moved to the leftmost position to form a single block of chips.

2. **Misinterpretation of the Problem:**
   - The problem requires moving chips to the closest free cell to the left until all chips form a single block. The current implementation does not simulate these moves but only counts free cells.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Identify the positions of all chips (`1`s).
2. Determine the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips to the leftmost possible position.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the index of the rightmost chip
        rightmost_chip_index = -1
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == 1:
                rightmost_chip_index = i
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of operations
        res = rightmost_chip_index
        print(res)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- We find the index of the rightmost chip in the list.
- The minimum number of operations required to move all chips to the leftmost position is equal to the index of the rightmost chip.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not simulate the process of moving chips to the leftmost position. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
