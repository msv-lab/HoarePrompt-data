### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to verify its correctness.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number.
   - It initializes `same` to 1, `num` to the first element, and `minn` to infinity.
   - For each element in the array starting from the second element, it checks if the current element is the same as `num`. If yes, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different, it updates `num` to the current element, sets `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`, and resets `same` to 1.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with `same`.
   - If `minn` is still infinity, it prints -1 (indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful). Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number.
   - However, this does not necessarily translate to the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition. The program does not account for the optimal strategy of removing elements to break the beauty condition.

4. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - **First Test Case**: `[2, 2, 2]` -> The program correctly outputs -1 because the array is already non-beautiful.
   - **Second Test Case**: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` -> The program outputs 1, which is correct because removing the middle 1 makes the array non-beautiful.
   - **Fourth Test Case**: `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]` -> The program outputs 3, which is incorrect because removing the first three elements (3, 3, 3) would make the array non-beautiful, requiring only 3 removals.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It calculates the minimum length of consecutive segments but does not consider the optimal strategy of removing elements to break the beauty condition.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
