Output State: **`minn` is 1 or 2, `same` is 1, 2, or 3, `num` is either `ar[0]`, `ar[i-1]`, or `ar[5]` based on the condition, `ar` is updated with the first 6 integers from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, and `len(ar)` is 6.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was previously less than 6, after executing this line, `i` is now `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
