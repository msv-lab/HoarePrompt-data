Output State: **`minn` is the minimum of `minn` (infinity) and `same` (1), `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[i]`, `ar` is updated with integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 3, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value (`infinity`) and `same` (`1`). Since `infinity` is greater than `1`, `minn` will be set to `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
