Output State: `same` is a non-negative integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list `ar`, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `same` is the maximum consecutive count of the same number in the list `ar`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list. The variable `same` keeps track of the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of the same number in the list `ar`. Therefore, `same` will hold the value of the longest sequence of identical numbers found in the list.
