Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `ar` minus `n`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `same` is 1, `num` is the last element of `ar` if it was not equal to the previous `num` when the loop ended, otherwise, `same` can take any value from 1 to the maximum value of `same` observed during the loop, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `n`. The other variables (`i`, `minn`, `same`, `num`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The value of `i` is updated to reflect the length of `ar` minus the input integer `n`.
