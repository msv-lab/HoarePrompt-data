Postcondition: `same` is either 3 or 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list `ar`, `i` is less than `len(ar) - 1`. If `ar[i] == num`, then `same` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `i` is incremented by 1 and remains less than `len(ar) - 1`, and `num` is the value of `ar[i]`.
