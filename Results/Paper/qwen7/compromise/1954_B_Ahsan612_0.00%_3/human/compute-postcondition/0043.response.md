Based on the initial state provided:

- `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last element in the list `ar`.
- `minn` is the minimum value found among the counts of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.
- `num` is the last element of `ar`.

The `print(minn)` statement will print the value of `minn`, which is the minimum value found among the counts of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`.

Since the exact list `ar` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `minn`. However, we know that `minn` is the smallest count of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum value found among the counts of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list ar)**
