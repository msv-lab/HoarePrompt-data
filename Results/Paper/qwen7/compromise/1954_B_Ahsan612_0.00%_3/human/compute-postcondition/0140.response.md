Output State: **After all iterations, `minn` will hold the minimum value of the counts of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar` across all test cases. If no such minimum is found (i.e., all sequences are of length 1), `minn` will be -1. `same` will be 1 for the last iteration, `num` will be the last element of `ar` for the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `len(ar)`, and `t` will be the total number of test cases.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `minn` will contain the smallest count of consecutive identical elements found in any of the arrays `ar` across all test cases. If every sequence of identical elements has a length of 1, indicating no repeated elements, `minn` will be set to -1. The variables `same`, `num`, `i`, and `t` will reflect the state of the last processed test case.
