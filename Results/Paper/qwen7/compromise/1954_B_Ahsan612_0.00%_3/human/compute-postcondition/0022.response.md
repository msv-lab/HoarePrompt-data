Output State: **`same` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list `ar`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `num` is equal to `ar[i]`**.

This means that the variable `num` has been assigned the value of `ar[i]`, where `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous states.
