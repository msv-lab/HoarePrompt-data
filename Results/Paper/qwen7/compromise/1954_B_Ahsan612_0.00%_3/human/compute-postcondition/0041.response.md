Based on the initial state provided:

- `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last element in the list `ar`.
- `minn` is set to infinity.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.
- `num` is the last element of `ar`.

The print statement is simply `print(-1)`, which will directly print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
