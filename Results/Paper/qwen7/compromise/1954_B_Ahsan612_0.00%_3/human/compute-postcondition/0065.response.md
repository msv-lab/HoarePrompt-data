Output State: **`i` is 4, `same` is 3 if `ar[i-1]` equals `num`, otherwise `same` remains 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was set to 3. After executing the code, `i` becomes 4. The values of `minn`, `ar`, `t`, `num`, and `same` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by subsequent code. Since `i` was incremented to 4, `same` will now be checked against `ar[3]` (if `ar[i]` equals `num`) or will remain 1 if `ar[3]` does not equal `num`.
