Output State: **`same` is either 2 or 3, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list `ar`, `i` is incremented by 1 and `i + 1` must be less than `len(ar)`**.

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1. Given that `same` was either 1 or 2 initially, after the increment, `same` will now be either 2 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
