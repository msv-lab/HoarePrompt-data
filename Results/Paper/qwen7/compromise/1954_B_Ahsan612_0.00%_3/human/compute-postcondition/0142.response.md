Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n`, followed by a list `ar` of `n` integers. It then determines the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`. If no such minimum is found (i.e., all sequences are of length 1), it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the minimum length. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
