Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` is the smallest value of `same` encountered during the loop's execution, `same` is 1, and `num` is the last element of `ar` if `ar[i-1]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `same` could be any value from 1 to the maximum `same` encountered during the loop's execution.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list. The variable `minn` will hold the minimum value of `same` found during the loop, as it is updated whenever a new value of `same` is smaller than the current `minn`. The variable `same` will be reset to 1 at the start of each new segment of identical numbers, so its final value will be 1. Lastly, `num` will be the last element of `ar` unless the last segment of identical numbers has a different value, in which case `same` will reflect the count of that segment.
