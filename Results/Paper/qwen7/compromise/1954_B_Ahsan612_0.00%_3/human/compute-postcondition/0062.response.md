Output State: **`minn` is the minimum of `minn` (which was infinity) and `same` (which is 1); `ar` is a list of integers created from the input; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 3; `num` is `ar[2]`; `same` is 1; and `same` is set to 1.**

In this case, the code simply sets `same` to 1, which does not change its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
