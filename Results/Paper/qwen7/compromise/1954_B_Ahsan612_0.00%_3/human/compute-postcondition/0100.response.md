Output State: **`minn` is infinity, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `ar` is updated with integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `i = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `i`. No other variables are affected, and the initial state of `minn`, `same`, `num`, `ar`, and `n` remains unchanged.
