Output State: **`minn` is 1 or 2, `same` is 2, `num` is either `ar[0]`, `ar[i-1]`, or `ar[5]` based on the condition, `ar` is updated with the first 6 integers from the input, `i` must be less than 6, and `len(ar)` is 6.**

Explanation: The variable `same` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
