Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the number of iterations, which is determined by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last element in the list `ar`.
   - If `minn` is infinity, then `minn` remains infinity.
   - Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum value found among the counts of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.
   - `num` is the last element of `ar`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider what changes might occur in the loop head. Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the next input will determine if the loop continues.

4. **Update the state**:
   - The variable `i` (which is equal to `len(ar)`) will remain the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - The variable `num` (the last element of `ar`) will remain the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - The variables `same`, `minn`, `t`, and `n` will remain unchanged unless the new input affects them, but since the loop head does not directly modify these variables, they stay the same.

5. **New input for the loop**: The loop will execute one more time if the new input (read from `int(input())`) is a positive integer. Therefore, the new input will be read and used to control the loop.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last element in the list `ar`, if `minn` is infinity, then `minn` remains infinity, otherwise `minn` is the minimum value found among the counts of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, and the next input will control the loop execution.**

Since the exact values of `same`, `minn`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, and `num` do not change, we can summarize the state as:

**State: `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last element in the list `ar`, if `minn` is infinity, then `minn` remains infinity, otherwise `minn` is the minimum value found among the counts of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, and the next input will control the loop execution.**
