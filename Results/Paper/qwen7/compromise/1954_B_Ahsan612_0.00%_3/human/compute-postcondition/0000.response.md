Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder and typically represents the index or the value generated by `range(int(input()))`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since `_` is just a placeholder, it doesn't require any specific adjustment.
   - The key variable here is the input itself, which determines how many times the loop will run. This is represented by `int(input())`.

3. **Understand the Input:**
   - The input is an integer `t` such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, which means the loop will run `t` times.

4. **Formulate the State:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input `t`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
