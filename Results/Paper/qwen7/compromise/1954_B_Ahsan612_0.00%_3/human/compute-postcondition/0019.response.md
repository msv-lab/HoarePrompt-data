The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `i + 1 < len(ar)`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
2. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(ar)`.
3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i + 1` must be less than `len(ar)`.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`. We need to ensure that this new value of `i` is still less than `len(ar)`.

So, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect this condition.

State: **`same` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list `ar`, `i` is incremented by 1 and `i + 1` must be less than `len(ar)`**
