Output State: `minn` is the minimum value between 1 and 2, `same` is 2, `num` is either `ar[0]`, `ar[i-1]`, or `ar[5]` based on the condition, `ar` is updated with the first 6 integers from the input, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `len(ar)` is 6.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `minn` will be either 1 or 2 (depending on the values processed), `same` will be 2 indicating the longest sequence of the same number found, `num` will be the last number that was being counted in the sequence, `ar` will contain the first 6 integers from the input, `i` will be equal to the length of `ar` which is 6, and `len(ar)` will also be 6.
