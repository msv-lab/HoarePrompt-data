Output State: **`minn` is set to infinity, `ar` is a list of integers created from the input, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is `ar[0]`, `same` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `minn = inf` sets the variable `minn` to infinity (`inf`). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
