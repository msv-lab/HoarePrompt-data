Postcondition: `same` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list `ar`, `i` is the index of the first element in `ar` that is equal to `num`, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2 and `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `same` remains 1, `minn` is set to 1, and `i` is set to 3.
