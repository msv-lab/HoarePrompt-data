Output State: **cur is greater than 3, i is 0.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `cur` is greater than 3, and the value of `i` is 0. This indicates that the loop completed all its iterations without breaking early due to the condition `M[i] <= i` for any `i` from 0 up to the final value of `cur`. The final value of `cur` is more than 3, and the loop exited when checking `i` starting from 0, finding it to satisfy the condition `M[i] <= i`.
