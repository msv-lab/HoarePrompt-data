Output State: **`M` is a list of integers, `cur` is equal to `i`, the index `i` is within the bounds of `M`, and the value at index `i` of `M` is less than or equal to `i`. We break out of the loop or if statement we were inside.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or conditional block it is within. Therefore, the values of `M`, `cur`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition about the value at index `i` of `M` also remains valid. We simply indicate that we have broken out of the loop or conditional structure.
