Output State: **`cur` is the fifth element of `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this scenario, since there is no loop or conditional structure (like a switch) that the `break` statement is exiting from, the values of the variables remain unchanged. However, the `M[cur]` value is already set to 1 if `num` is greater than `cur-1`, otherwise it is incremented by 1. Since the `break` statement does not affect these conditions, `M[cur]` will be incremented by 1 regardless of the original condition. Therefore, the only change is that `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.
