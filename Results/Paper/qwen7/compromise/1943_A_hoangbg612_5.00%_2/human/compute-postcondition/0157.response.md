Output State: **`num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is `num`, and `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` updates the value of `cur` to be the same as `num`. The other variables (`i` and the postcondition related to breaking out of the loop) remain unchanged. Therefore, `num` remains the next element in `N`, `cur` is now equal to `num`, and `i` is still 0.
