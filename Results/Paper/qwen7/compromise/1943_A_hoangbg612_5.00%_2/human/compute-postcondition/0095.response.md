Output State: **`cur` is equal to `num`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, otherwise `M[cur]` remains unchanged.**

This means that the current value of `cur` is now the same as `num`, and the condition for incrementing `M[cur]` based on whether `num` is greater than `cur + 1` remains the same as before.
