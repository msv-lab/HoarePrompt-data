Output State: **`cur` is increased by 1, `i` is 2, `T` is 3, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty list of sorted integers, `M` is an empty dictionary, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block that `cur` was being increased by 1 within, but does not change the values of other variables. The values of `cur`, `i`, `T`, `S`, `N`, and `M` remain unchanged, and the program exits the loop or conditional block.
