Output State: **`M` is a list of integers, `cur` is equal to `i`, the index `i` is within the bounds of `M`, and the value at index `i` of `M` is less than or equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The code `cur = i` updates the value of `cur` to be equal to the current value of `i`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
