Output State: **`T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4 remains valid, and no other variables are affected.**

This means that `T` now holds the value entered by the user, constrained within the specified range, while the precondition for `t` is maintained, and no changes are made to other variables like `n` or `a`.
