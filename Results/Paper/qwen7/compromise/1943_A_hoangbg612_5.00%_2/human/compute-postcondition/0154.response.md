Output State: **`num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is -1 plus 1 and `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. The values of `num`, `cur`, and `i` remain the same as they were in the initial state. Additionally, it indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
