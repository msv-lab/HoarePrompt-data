Output State: **`num` is greater than `cur + 1`; `cur` is equal to `num`; `M[cur]` is 1**

Explanation: The code assigns the value 1 to `M[cur]`. Since `cur` is equal to `num`, `M[num]` is set to 1. The conditions that `num` is greater than `cur + 1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes that `M[cur]` (which is `M[num]`) is now 1.
