Output State: **`cur` is the last index `i` for which the condition `M[i] <= i` was satisfied before breaking out of the loop, `T` is 0 (or a negative value), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `M` maps each relevant element to its frequency in `N`.**

Explanation: The code takes input as a space-separated list of integers using `input().split()` and converts it into a list of integers using `map(int, ...)`. This list is assigned to `N`. The other variables (`cur`, `T`, `S`, and `M`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
