Output State: **`cur` is equal to the third element of `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1, and the first element of `N` is less than or equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. Here, `cur` is equal to the third element of `N`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged, so `M[cur]` is updated, and the first element of `N` is still less than or equal to `num`.
