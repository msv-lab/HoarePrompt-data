Output State: **`cur` is either 0 or equal to `next_num` (if `next_num > cur`), `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers where the next element is `next_num`, `M` is a dictionary containing the key `cur` with value 1 if `cur` was -1 before the increment, or the key `cur+1` with value 1 if `cur` was not -1 before the increment.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. If `cur` was -1 initially, it becomes 0. If `cur` was already equal to `next_num`, it remains unchanged. The other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, and `M`) remain unaffected by this operation.
