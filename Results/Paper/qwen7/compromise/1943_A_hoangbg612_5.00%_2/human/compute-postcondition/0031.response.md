Output State: **`cur` is either -1 or equal to the next element in `N` + 1, `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers where the next element is `next_num`, and `M` is a dictionary containing the key `cur` with value 1 if `cur` was updated, or the key `next_num` with value 1 if `cur` was -1 and updated, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Since no variables are updated or assigned new values within the `break` statement itself, the values of `cur`, `T`, `S`, `N`, and `M` remain unchanged from their initial states.
