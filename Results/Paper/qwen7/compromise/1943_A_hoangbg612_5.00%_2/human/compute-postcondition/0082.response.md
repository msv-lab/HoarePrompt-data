Output State: **`cur` is equal to the fourth element of `N`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `M[cur]` might have been updated based on a condition. The value of `cur` remains unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify any variables. The precondition that `first element of N is less than or equal to num` is still valid after the code execution.
