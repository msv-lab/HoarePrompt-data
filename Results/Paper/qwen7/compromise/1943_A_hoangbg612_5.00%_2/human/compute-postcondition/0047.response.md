Output State: **`cur` is equal to `i`, `M` is a list of integers, the index `i` is within the bounds of `M`, and the value at index `i` of `M` is less than or equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently inside. However, since no loop or conditional block was specified in the code snippet, we assume it is part of a loop or conditional structure. The values of `cur`, `M`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition about the value at index `i` of `M` being less than or equal to `i` still holds true. We simply break out of the loop or conditional structure.
