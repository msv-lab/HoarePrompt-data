Postcondition: `cur` is either equal to the next `num` in `N` and `i` is 2, or `cur` is -1, `i` is 0, and `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `2`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is equal to `num` and `M[cur]` is 1. Otherwise, `cur` remains as either the next `num` in `N` and `i` is 2, or `cur` is -1, `i` is 0, and `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `2`.
