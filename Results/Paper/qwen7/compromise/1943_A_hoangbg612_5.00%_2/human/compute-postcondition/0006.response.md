Output State: **`cur` is -1, `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `M` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `M`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
