Output State: **`cur` is either -1 or equal to `next_num` (if `next_num > cur`), `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers where the next element is `next_num`, `M` is a dictionary containing the key `cur` with value 2 if `cur` was -1 or the key `next_num` with value 1 if `cur` was updated.**

Explanation: The line `M[cur] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. Since `cur` is either -1 or equal to `next_num` (if `cur` is less than `next_num`), the value of `M[cur]` will be incremented by 1. If `cur` was -1, the new value for the key -1 will be 1, and if `cur` was updated to `next_num`, the new value for the key `next_num` will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
