Output State: **`cur` is equal to `num`, `i` is 2, `T` is 3, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary with key `cur` and value 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
