Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `num`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `N`.

3. **Analyze the postconditions**:
   - `cur` is equal to `num`.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `M[cur]` is 1.
   - Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.
   - The first element of `N` is less than or equal to `num`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `num` from the list `N`, the value of `num` will change in each iteration.
   - The first element of `N` being less than or equal to `num` suggests that `num` is being incremented or updated based on the elements in `N`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `cur` will be set to the current `num` in the next iteration.
   - `M[cur]` will be either 1 or incremented by 1 depending on the condition.
   - The first element of `N` must be less than or equal to the new `num` in the next iteration.

Given these points, let's assume the current state at the end of the previous iteration is as follows (since it's not explicitly given, we'll use the information provided):

- Let's say `num` was the second element of `N` in the previous iteration.
- Therefore, `cur` was equal to the second element of `N`.
- `M[cur]` was updated based on the condition.
- The first element of `N` was less than or equal to `num`.

For the next iteration, `num` will be the third element of `N` (assuming the list `N` has at least three elements).

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `cur` will be set to the third element of `N`.
- `M[cur]` will be updated based on the condition with the third element of `N`.
- The first element of `N` must still be less than or equal to `num`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`cur` is equal to the third element of `N`, `M[cur]` is updated based on the condition, and the first element of `N` is less than or equal to `num`**.
