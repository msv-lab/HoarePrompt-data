Output State: **`cur` is -1, `i` is 0, `T` is 3, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The line `cur = -1` changes the value of `cur` from being greater than 0 to -1. The values of `i`, `T`, `S`, and `N` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
