Output State: **`cur` is now equal to `num`, `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with key `cur` and value `1`, and if `num > cur + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `num > cur + 1` is not met, the values remain unchanged as per the precondition.**

This means that the dictionary `M` now contains the key `cur` (which is equal to `num`) with the value `1`. All other variables retain their initial conditions unless otherwise specified.
