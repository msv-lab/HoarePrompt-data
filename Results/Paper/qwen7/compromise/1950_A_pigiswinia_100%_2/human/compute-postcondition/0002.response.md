Output State: The output state will consist of 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided. Specifically, 'STAIR' will be printed if \(a < b < c\), 'PEAK' if \(a < b > c\), and 'NONE' otherwise. The exact sequence of these outputs depends on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop.
