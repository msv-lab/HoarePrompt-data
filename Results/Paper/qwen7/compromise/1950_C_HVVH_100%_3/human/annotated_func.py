#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format where hh is the hour from 00 to 23 and mm is the minute from 00 to 59.
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'PM'
        
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
        
    #State: day is 'AM', n is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of times provided as input, converting them between 24-hour and 12-hour formats, and prints the converted times along with 'AM' or 'PM'. Initially, the `day` variable is set to 'AM', and `n` is set to 0 after processing all inputs.
