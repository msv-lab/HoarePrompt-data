Reasoning:

1. The function starts by setting `day` to 'AM' and reading the number of test cases `n`.
2. It then iterates `n` times, reading each test case's time in the format "hh:mm".
3. Inside the loop, it splits the string `s` into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
4. The logic for converting 24-hour format to 12-hour format is as follows:
   - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, it sets `day` to 'AM', and if `h` is 12, it changes `day` to 'PM'.
5. It then prints the formatted 12-hour time along with 'AM' or 'PM'.

This logic correctly handles all edge cases:
- When `h` is 0, it correctly converts it to 12:00 AM.
- When `h` is 12, it correctly keeps it as 12:xx PM.
- When `h` is greater than 12, it correctly subtracts 12 to get the 12-hour equivalent.
- For other values of `h`, it correctly sets `day` to 'AM'.

Given that the provided example matches the expected output and the logic covers all necessary conditions, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
