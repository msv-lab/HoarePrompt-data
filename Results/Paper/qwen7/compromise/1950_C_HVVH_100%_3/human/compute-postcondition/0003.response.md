Output State: **day is 'AM', n is 0.**

Explanation: The loop runs `n` times, where `n` is an input integer. After all iterations, the value of `n` will be 0, and the `day` variable remains 'AM' because it is not modified within the loop body unless `h` is 0 or 12, which does not change the `day` from its initial state in this context. Since the loop runs for `n` times and `n` becomes 0 after all iterations, there are no further changes to `day`.
