Output State: **`day` is 'AM', `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value entered by the user (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The initial state of `day` being 'AM' remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes both the updated value of `n` and the unchanged value of `day`.
