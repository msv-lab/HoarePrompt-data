Postcondition: **`i` is the next element in `tmp`, `ans` is incremented by `x + y - 2` (or `i + 1` if `y >= i - 1`), `tmp` is sorted and includes `len(a)`, `y` is recalculated based on the new `i`, `ii` is `k + 1`, `tt` retains its original value, `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is either equal to 2 or even and equals 2 modulo 2, and `tmp` must include `len(a)`. If `y >= i - 1`, `ans` is incremented by `i`; otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `x + y - 2` (or `i + 1` if `y >= i - 1`).**
