Output State: **`tmp` must not be empty, `i` is removed from `tmp`, `ans` is the sum of `ans` and the first element from `tmp` before removal.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is the first element from `tmp`. The code `ans += i` adds the value of `i` to `ans`. After this operation, `i` is no longer in `tmp`. Therefore, `tmp` must not be empty (since `i` was its first element), but now `i` is removed from `tmp`. The value of `ans` is updated to be the sum of its original value and the value of `i`.
