Output State: **`tmp` must not be empty, `i` is removed from `tmp`, `ans` is the sum of `ans` and the first element from `tmp` before removal, `y` is decreased by `i - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `y` is decreased by the value of `i - 1`. The other variables (`tmp`, `i`, `ans`) remain in the same state as they were before the code execution, except that `i` has been removed from `tmp` and `ans` has been updated to include the first element of `tmp` before `i` was removed.
