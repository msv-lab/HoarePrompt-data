Output State: **`i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is 1**

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given that `ans` was initially not specified, it is assumed to be 0 (as it is common for variables to start at 0 unless otherwise initialized). After executing the code, `ans` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `a` remain unchanged.
