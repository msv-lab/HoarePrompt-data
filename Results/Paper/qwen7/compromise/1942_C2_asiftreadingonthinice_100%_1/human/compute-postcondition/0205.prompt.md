Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is an integer obtained from input, representing the number of test cases. The initial conditions for each test case (n, x, y) and the set of x distinct integers have not yet been read.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(tt):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = x + y - 2
    tmp = []
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
            tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
    if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
    tmp.sort()
    for i in tmp:
        if y >= i - 1:
            ans += i
            y -= i - 1
        else:
            break
    ans += y
    print(min(ans, n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is the total sum of all elements in `tmp` where `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and equals 2 modulo 2, plus any additional increment of 1 if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, and `y` is the remaining value after subtracting `i - 1` from it as many times as possible within each iteration of the loop, or it remains unchanged if the loop breaks early; `ans` is incremented by `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop completes, `ans` will be incremented by `y`, `tmp` will be fully sorted with `len(a)` as one of its elements, `y` will be the remaining value after subtracting `i - 1` from `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` as many times as possible for the last `i` processed in the loop, `ii` will be `k + 1`, `tt` will retain its original value, and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` will be either equal to 2 or even and equals 2 modulo 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is the sum of its initial value plus the sum of all elements in `tmp`, and `y` is reduced by the sum of all elements in `tmp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
