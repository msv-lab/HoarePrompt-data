Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is incremented by `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is sorted, `y` is the remaining value after subtracting `i - 1` from `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` as many times as possible, `ii` is `k + 1`, `tt` retains its original value, and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is either equal to 2 or even and equals 2 modulo 2, and `tmp` must include `len(a)`, and `y` is less than `i - 1`.
