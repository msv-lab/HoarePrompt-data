Postcondition: `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1`, `ans` will be the sum of all increments made to it during the loop, `tmp` will contain all the values added to it whenever `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and equals to 2 modulo 2, and if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0`, then `tmp` will also contain the value of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.
