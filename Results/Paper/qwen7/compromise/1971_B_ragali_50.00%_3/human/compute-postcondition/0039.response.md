Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `s` is a non-empty string with at least two characters.
   - `i` is the second-to-last character of `s.strip()`.
   - `a` is a set containing the element `i`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in s:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - The variable `i` takes on the value of each character in `s` during each iteration.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `s`, the value of `i` will change with each iteration.
   - The variable `a` is initialized with the second-to-last character of `s.strip()`, and it does not change within the loop.
   - The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - The string `s` itself does not change; only the value of `i` changes.

5. **Determining the Next Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the second-to-last character of `s.strip()`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be the next character in `s` when read from left to right.

6. **New State:**
   - `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `s` remains a non-empty string with at least two characters.
   - `i` will now be the next character in `s` (the first-to-last character of `s.strip()`).
   - `a` still contains the element `i` from the previous iteration.

Given this reasoning, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, `i` is the first-to-last character of `s.strip()`, and `a` is a set containing the element `i`**.
