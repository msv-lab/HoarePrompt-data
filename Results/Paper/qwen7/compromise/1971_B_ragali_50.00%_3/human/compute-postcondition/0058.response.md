Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the stripped string `s.strip()`, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the stripped string `s.strip()`, `newstr` is the string obtained by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`, and `isreverse` is the reverse of the string `s`. If `isreverse` is not equal to `s`, then `newstr` is equal to `s`. Otherwise, `isreverse` is equal to `s`.
