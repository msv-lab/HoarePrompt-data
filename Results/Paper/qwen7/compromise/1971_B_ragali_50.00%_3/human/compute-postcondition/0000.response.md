Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input().strip(' '))` reads an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and converts it to an integer. This integer is assigned to `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, the output state reflects that `t` is now an input integer within this range. The length and content of the string `s` remain unchanged as no operation on `s` was performed.
