Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `s` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `s = input().strip(' ')` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the input, and assigns it to the variable `s`. The initial state of `t` and `i` remains unchanged.
