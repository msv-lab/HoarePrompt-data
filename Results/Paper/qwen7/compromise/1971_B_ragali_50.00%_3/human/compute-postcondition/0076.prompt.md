Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is the stripped input, `i` is the first character of the stripped input incremented by 1, `a` is the set of unique characters from the stripped input, `newstr` is the string obtained by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s` if the set `a` has more than one unique character; otherwise, it remains unchanged, `isreverse` is the reverse of the original `s`, `a` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    a.add(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a non-empty string, `a` is a set containing the character `i`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a non-empty string (without its first character), `a` is a set containing the characters `i` and `i`, where `i` is the first character of the original string `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty string (without its first two characters), `a` is a set containing the characters `i`, `i`, and `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
