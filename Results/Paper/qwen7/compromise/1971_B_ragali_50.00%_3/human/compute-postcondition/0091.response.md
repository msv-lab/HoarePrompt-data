Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is an empty string.
- `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the original string `s`. Since `s` is empty, `a` will also be an empty set.
- The length of `a` is explicitly stated to be 1, which contradicts the fact that `a` is an empty set. However, since the problem specifies the length of `a` as 1, we must consider this as the correct state for the purpose of answering the question.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('NO')
```

The output will be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
