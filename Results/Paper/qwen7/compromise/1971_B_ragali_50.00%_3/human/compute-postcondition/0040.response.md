Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, `i` is the first-to-last character of `s.strip()`, and `a` is a set containing the element `i` with `i` added.**

Explanation: The code `a.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `a`. Since `i` was already a member of the set, adding it again does not change the set. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
