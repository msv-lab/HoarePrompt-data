Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input().strip(' ')
    a = set()
    for i in s:
        a.add(i)
    if len(a) > 1:
        print('YES')
        newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
        isreverse = s[::-1]
        if newstr != s:
            print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
        elif isreverse != s:
            print(isreverse)
        else:
            print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is the last character of the string `s` if the length of the set `a` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `i` is the third element of the set `s`. `s` is a non-empty string, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s` along with the initial value `0` if the length of `a` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `a` is a set containing the elements 0, the first element of the set `s`, and the second element of the set `s`. The length of `a` is greater than 1 in the first case, and exactly 1 in the second case.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the stripped string `s.strip()`, and `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the stripped string `s.strip()`. If the set `a` has more than one unique character, then `newstr` is the string obtained by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`. If the set `a` has one or no unique characters, `newstr` remains unchanged. Additionally, `isreverse` is the reverse of the string `s`, and `newstr` becomes equal to `s` if `isreverse` is not equal to `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is an empty string, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the original string `s`, and if the length of set `a` is greater than 1, `newstr` is a string identical to `s`; otherwise, the length of `a` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
