Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is the last character of the string `s` if the length of the set `a` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `i` is the third element of the set `s`. `s` is a non-empty string, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s` along with the initial value `0` if the length of `a` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `a` is a set containing the elements 0, the first element of the set `s`, and the second element of the set `s`. The length of `a` is greater than 1 in the first case, and exactly 1 in the second case.
