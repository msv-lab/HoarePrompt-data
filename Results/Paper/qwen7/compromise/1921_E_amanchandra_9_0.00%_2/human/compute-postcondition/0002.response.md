Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'Draw', 'Alice', and 'Bob' based on the conditions specified within the loop for each test case. For each test case, if `xa > xb`, the output will be 'Draw'. Otherwise, depending on the positions of `ya` and `yb` relative to the calculated range, the output will be either 'Alice' or 'Bob'.
