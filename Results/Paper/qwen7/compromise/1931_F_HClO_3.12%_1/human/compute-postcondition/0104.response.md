Output State: **`idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or specific values based on the conditions, `a1` and `a2` remain 0, `l11` and `l22` remain 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 2, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is -1, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, and we continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous states, and the condition that `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2` remains unchanged.
