Output State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `n` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the only condition that remains valid is that `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, while the other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `n`) remain unchanged.
