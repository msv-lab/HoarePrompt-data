Postcondition: `a1` is the first integer input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a2` is the second integer input from the split, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. The current state of the program has `l11` not equal to `l22`.
