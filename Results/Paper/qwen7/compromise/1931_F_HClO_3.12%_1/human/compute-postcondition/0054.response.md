Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i < n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or specific values based on conditions.
   - `a1` and `a2` remain 0.
   - `l11` and `l22` remain 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1.
   - `i` is either `n - 2`, `n - 1 - max(p1, p2)`, or remains unchanged.
   - If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative integers, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is either `n - 2`, `n - 1 - max(p1, p2)`, or remains unchanged, let's consider the possible values for `i`:
     - If `i` was `n - 2`, it would now be `n - 3`.
     - If `i` was `n - 1 - max(p1, p2)`, it would now be `n - 2 - max(p1, p2)`.
     - If `i` remained unchanged, it would still be `i` (either `n - 2` or `n - 1 - max(p1, p2)`).

5. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - If `i` was `n - 2`, it becomes `n - 3`, which is valid.
   - If `i` was `n - 1 - max(p1, p2)`, it becomes `n - 2 - max(p1, p2)`, which is valid as long as `max(p1, p2) < 1` (since `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1).
   - If `i` remained unchanged, it must still be less than `n - 1`.

6. **Update the States**:
   - `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged.
   - `a1` and `a2` remain 0.
   - `l11` and `l22` remain 0.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.
   - `m` remains 0.
   - `p1` and `p2` remain either 0 or 1.
   - `i` is updated to `n - 3` if it was `n - 2`, or `n - 2 - max(p1, p2)` if it was `n - 1 - max(p1, p2)`, or remains unchanged if it was already less than `n - 1`.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or specific values based on the conditions, `a1` and `a2` remain 0, `l11` and `l22` remain 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is either `n - 3`, `n - 2 - max(p1, p2)`, or remains unchanged.**
