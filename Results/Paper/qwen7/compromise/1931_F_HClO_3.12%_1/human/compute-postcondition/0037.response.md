Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, `l11` is 0, `l22` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is either equal to `n - 1 - max(p1, p2)` (if the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is true) or `i` remains unchanged (if the condition is false), and `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1**, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is inside. Since no variable values are altered and the conditions remain the same, the output state includes all the original conditions and values, plus the fact that we have broken out of the loop or conditional block.
