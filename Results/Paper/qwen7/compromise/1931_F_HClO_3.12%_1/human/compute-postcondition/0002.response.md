Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them to integers. These values are then assigned to `n` and `m`. The initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 0, while `n` and `m` now hold the integer values of the user's inputs.
