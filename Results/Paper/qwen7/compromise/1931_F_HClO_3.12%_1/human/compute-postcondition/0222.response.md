Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and either `idx1` is set to `i` or `idx2` is set to `i`, `p2` is 1, and both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the code, we assume it breaks out of the implied context. All conditions and values of variables remain as they were in the initial state.
