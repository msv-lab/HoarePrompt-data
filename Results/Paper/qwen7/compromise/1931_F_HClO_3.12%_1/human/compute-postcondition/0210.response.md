Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and `idx1` is equal to `i`, and either `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1` with `p1` being 1, or `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1` with `p1` being 1, or `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, and `p2` is 1, and both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**

This means that the variable `idx1` is now set to the value of `i`, while all other conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
