Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and either `idx1` is set to `i` or `idx2` is set to `i`; now `idx1` is 2 and `idx2` is 2, `p2` is 1, and both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative.**

Explanation: The code sets `idx1` and `idx2` both to `i`, which is 2. All other conditions remain unchanged.
