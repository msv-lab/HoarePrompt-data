Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `m` must be exactly 1, `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, `val` is a list containing as many tuples as the value of `m` - 2, each tuple is of the form (`a3`, `l3`).

This means that after the loop executes all its iterations (which is `m-2` times based on the given range), `m` will be reduced to 1 (since it starts greater than 1 and decreases by 1 each iteration), and `val` will contain as many tuples as specified by the loop, each consisting of `a3` and `l3`.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `m` is greater than 1, `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples, each tuple being (`a3`, `l3`), and `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that includes all elements of `l` except `a3`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `m` is greater than 1, `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers after the first two integers have been processed, and if `l3` is not equal to a list of integers excluding `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `m` is greater than 1, `a3` is the next integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers after processing the first two integers. If `l3` is not equal to a list of the remaining integers after excluding `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
