Postcondition: `m` is greater than 1, `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples, each tuple being (`a3`, `l3`), and `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that includes all elements of `l` except `a3`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
