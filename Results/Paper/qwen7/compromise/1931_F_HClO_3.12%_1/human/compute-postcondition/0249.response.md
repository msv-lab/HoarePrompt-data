Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and `idx1` is set to `n-3`; `p2` is 1; both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative; the list `val` is created but is empty; `idx2` is `n-3`; `a1` is inserted into the list `val` at index `idx2`; `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.**

Explanation: The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value `a1` into the list `l1` (which is referred to as `val` in the output state) at the index `idx2`. Since `idx2` is `n-3`, `a1` is inserted at index `n-3` in the list `val`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
