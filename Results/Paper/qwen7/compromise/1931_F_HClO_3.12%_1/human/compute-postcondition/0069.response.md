Postcondition: **`idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or specific values based on the conditions. `a1` and `a2` remain 0, `l11` and `l22` remain 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`. If `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`, then both `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i`. Otherwise, `idx1` is `i` and `idx2` is `-1` (or vice versa). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
