Output State: **`m` is `n`, `a3` is the last integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is an empty list, `val` is a list containing as many tuples as `m-2` (which is now 0 since `m` is `n`), each tuple being (`a3`, `l3`), and `t` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. Since `m` was initially 1, it gets updated to the value of `n`. The value of `a3` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `l3` and `val` also remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `t` remains 1.
