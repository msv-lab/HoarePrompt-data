Output State: **`a1` is the first integer input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a2` is the second integer input from the split, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers input after the second integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l11` which contains all elements from `l1` except for `a2`. The values of `a1`, `n`, `m`, `a2`, and `l2` remain unchanged.
