Output State: **`a3` is an integer from the input split into a list, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining input split, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is either 0 or inserted into `l2` at index `idx1`, `l22` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is -1, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, and `l` is either `l1` or `l2` depending on the condition of the if statement.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `val` now contains one additional element, which is the tuple `(a3, l3)`.
