Postcondition: `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and `idx1` is set to `n-3`; `p2` is 1; both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative; the list `val` is created but is empty; `idx2` is `n-3`. Additionally, `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.
