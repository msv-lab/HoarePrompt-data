Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and either `idx1` is set to `i` or `idx2` is set to `i`, `p2` is 1, and both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative. This is because if `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the program sets either `idx1` or `idx2` to `i`, keeps `p2` as 1, and ensures that both `idx1` and `idx2` remain non-negative.
