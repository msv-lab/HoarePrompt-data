Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variable involved here is `m`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `m - 2` is greater than or equal to 0. This means `m` must be at least 2.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `m` is at least 2 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l22`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `t`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `m` being at least 2.

**State:**
**`m` must be at least 2**
