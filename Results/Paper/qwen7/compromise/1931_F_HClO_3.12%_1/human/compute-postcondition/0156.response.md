Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list containing all integers except the first one from the input, `m` is `n`, `a3` is the last integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is an empty list, `val` is an empty list, and `t` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` takes a space-separated input, converts each element to an integer, and unpacks the first element into `a1`. The rest of the elements are collected into a list `l1`. The variables `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state.
