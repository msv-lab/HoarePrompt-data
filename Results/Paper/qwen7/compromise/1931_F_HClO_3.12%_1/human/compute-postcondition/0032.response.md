Output State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, `l11` is 0, `l22` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, the current value of `m` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is equal to `n - 1 - max(p1, p2)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned, we assume it breaks out of the context it was used in, which could be a loop or an if-else statement. The values of all variables remain as they were before the `break` statement.
