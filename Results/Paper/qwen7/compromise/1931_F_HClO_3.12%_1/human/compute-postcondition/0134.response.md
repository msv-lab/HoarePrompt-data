Based on the initial state described:

- `m` is greater than 1.
- `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer.
- `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers.
- `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples, each tuple being (`a3`, `l3`).
- `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that includes all elements of `l` except `a3`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('no')
```

This print statement simply outputs the string `'no'`. Since no other variables or objects are involved in this print statement, the output is straightforward.

Output: **no**
