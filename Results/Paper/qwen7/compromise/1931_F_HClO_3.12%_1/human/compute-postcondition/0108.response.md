Output State: **`a3` is an integer from the input split into a list, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining input split, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, `l11` is 0, `l22` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is -1, `val` is an empty list, `l3` now has an additional element at index `idx2` which is `a1` (0).**

Explanation: The code inserts `a1` (which is 0) into the list `l1` at the position specified by `idx2`. Since `l1` was not mentioned in the initial state, it is assumed to be a separate list. However, the initial state only mentions `l3`, so the insertion happens in `l3` at index `idx2`. The value of `a1` is 0, so `l3` now has an extra 0 at the position `idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
