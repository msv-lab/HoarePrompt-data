Output State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `n`, `m`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.**

The code initializes `p1` and `p2` to 0. Since `idx1`, `idx2`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state, their values stay the same. Therefore, the updated values are `p1` is 0 and `p2` is 0, while the rest of the variables retain their initial values.
