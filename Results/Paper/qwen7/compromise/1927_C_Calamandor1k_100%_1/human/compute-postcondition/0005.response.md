Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains five elements: `n`, `m`, and `k` (all integers), and two lists `a` and `b`. The function returns a list of strings (`results`), where for each tuple in `cases`, if specific conditions regarding sets `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` are met, 'YES' is added to `results`; otherwise, 'NO' is added.**
