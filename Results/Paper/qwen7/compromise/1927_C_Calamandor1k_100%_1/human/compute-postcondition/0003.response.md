Output State: `results` is a list that may contain 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions met during each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each tuple (n, m, k, a, b) in `cases`, if the conditions regarding the sets `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` are satisfied, 'YES' is appended to `results`; otherwise, 'NO' is appended. The exact contents of `results` depend on the values of `cases`.
