Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Parameter `a` is expected to be a tuple containing an integer representing the dimension N of the field, and parameter `b` is a string that is split into two parts, representing the dimension M of the field. The function returns the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, where `x` and `y` are both assigned the value of `a[0]`, and `dx` and `dy` are the first and second parts of `b` split into two separate values.**
