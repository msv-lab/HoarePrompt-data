Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the field.
   - It initializes dictionaries to store player positions and goals.
   - It correctly identifies the initial positions of the Quaffle and goals.

2. **Movement and Action Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles movements using the `func_1` function, which updates the position of a player or bludger.
   - It correctly handles catching the Quaffle and throwing it.
   - The logic for eliminating a player when a bludger is encountered is implemented correctly.

3. **Scoring Logic**:
   - When a player throws the Quaffle into a goal belonging to the opposing team, the program correctly increments the score of the opposing team.
   - The Quaffle is moved to the middle of the field after scoring.
   - The program correctly prints "RED GOAL" or "BLUE GOAL" when a player scores in the wrong goal, awarding the point to the opposing team.

4. **Elimination Logic**:
   - Players are eliminated correctly when they encounter a bludger.
   - The elimination messages are printed in the correct format and order.

5. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates and prints the final score at the end of the game.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as multiple balls in the same cell and simultaneous eliminations correctly.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the rules and logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
