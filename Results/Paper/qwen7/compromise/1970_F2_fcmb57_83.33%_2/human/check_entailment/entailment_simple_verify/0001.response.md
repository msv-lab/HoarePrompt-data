### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the field.
   - It initializes dictionaries to store player positions and goals.
   - It correctly identifies the initial positions of the Quaffle and goals.

2. **Movement and Action Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles movements using the `func_1` function, which updates the position of a player or bludger.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the way the `func_1` function is used. The function should return a tuple `(x + dx, y + dy)` instead of just `x + dx, y + dy`. The current implementation might cause issues because it returns a single integer rather than a tuple.

3. **Scoring Logic**:
   - When a player throws the Quaffle into a goal belonging to the opposing team, the program correctly increments the score of the opposing team.
   - The Quaffle is moved to the middle of the field after scoring.
   - The program correctly prints "RED GOAL" or "BLUE GOAL" when a player scores in the wrong goal, awarding the point to the opposing team.

4. **Elimination Logic**:
   - Players are eliminated correctly when they encounter a bludger.
   - The elimination messages are printed in the correct format and order.

5. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates and prints the final score at the end of the game.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as multiple balls in the same cell and simultaneous eliminations correctly.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  ```python
  def func_1(a, b):
      x, y = a
      dx, dy = b
      return x + dx, y + dy
  ```
  - The function `func_1` is correctly defined and should work as intended. However, the issue lies in how it is called in the main loop:
    ```python
    players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
    ```
    - Here, `func_1` should return a tuple, but the assignment `players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])` is correct because `func_1` returns a tuple.

- **Movement Handling**:
  - The program correctly updates the positions of players and bludgers.
  - The logic for checking if a player is eliminated when encountering a bludger is correct.

- **Scoring Logic**:
  - The program correctly handles scoring and moving the Quaffle to the middle of the field after scoring.
  - The logic for printing "RED GOAL" or "BLUE GOAL" when a player scores in the wrong goal is correct.

- **Elimination Logic**:
  - The program correctly prints the elimination messages in the correct format and order.

- **Final Score Calculation**:
  - The program correctly calculates and prints the final score at the end of the game.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the annotated code and the original assessment, the program appears to correctly implement the rules and logic described in the problem statement. The only minor concern is the potential issue with the `func_1` function, but the way it is used in the main loop ensures that the positions are updated correctly.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
